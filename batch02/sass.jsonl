{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Sass Documentation is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Sass Documentation in sass.\n\n# Sass Documentation\n\nSass is a stylesheet language that’s compiled to CSS, allowing the use of variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more, with a fully CSS-compatible syntax.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Introduction\n\nSass is a stylesheet language that’s compiled to CSS. It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized and makes it easy to share design within and across projects.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nIf you’re looking for an introduction to Sass, check out the tutorial. If you want to look up a built-in Sass function, look no further than the built-in module reference. If you’re calling Sass from JavaScript, you may want the JS API documentation. Or the Dart API documentation if you’re calling it from Dart. Otherwise, use the table of contents for the language reference!\n\n## Older Versions\n\nThis documentation is written for the most recent version of the Sass language. If you’re using Dart Sass 1.85.1, you’ll have access to all the features described here. But if you’re using an older version of Dart Sass or a deprecated Sass implementation like LibSass or Ruby Sass, there may be some behavioral differences. Anywhere behavior differs between versions or implementations, the documentation includes a compatibility indicator.\n\n## Compatibility Indicators\n\nImplementations with a \"✓\" fully support the feature in question, and implementations with a \"✗\" don’t support it at all. Implementations with a version number started supporting the feature in question at that version. Implementations can also be marked as \"partial\".\n\n## Current Releases\n\n- Dart Sass 1.85.1 - LibSass 3.6.6 - Ruby Sass ⚰ - Implementation Guide\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation", "title": "Sass Documentation", "description": "Sass is a stylesheet language that’s compiled to CSS, allowing the use of variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more, with a fully CSS-compatible syntax.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 5, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 21:58:45", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"favicon": "https://sass-lang.com/icon.png", "description": "Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets", "title": "Sass: Documentation", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "language": "en", "scrapeId": "22f8860d-863e-4782-a48f-19cfaadfc05a", "sourceURL": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation", "url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Interpolation is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Interpolation in sass.\n\n# Interpolation\n\nInterpolation can be used almost anywhere in a Sass stylesheet to embed the result of a SassScript expression into a chunk of CSS.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@mixin corner-icon($name, $top-or-bottom, $left-or-right) {\n  .icon-#{$name} {\n    background-image: url(\"/icons/#{$name}.svg\");\n    position: absolute;\n    #{$top-or-bottom}: 0;\n    #{$left-or-right}: 0;\n  }\n}\n\n@include corner-icon(\"mail\", top, left);\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@mixin corner-icon($name, $top-or-bottom, $left-or-right)\n  .icon-#{$name}\n    background-image: url(\"/icons/#{$name}.svg\")\n    position: absolute\n    #{$top-or-bottom}: 0\n    #{$left-or-right}: 0\n\n@include corner-icon(\"mail\", top, left)\n```\n\n## CSS Output\n\n```css\n.icon-mail {\n  background-image: url(\"/icons/mail.svg\");\n  position: absolute;\n  top: 0;\n  left: 0;\n}\n```\n\n## In SassScript\n\nInterpolation can be used in SassScript to inject SassScript into unquoted strings. This is particularly useful when dynamically generating names (for example for animations), or when using slash-separated values. Note that interpolation in SassScript always returns an unquoted string.\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@mixin inline-animation($duration) {\n  $name: inline-#{unique-id()};\n\n  @keyframes #{$name} {\n    @content;\n  }\n\n  animation-name: $name;\n  animation-duration: $duration;\n  animation-iteration-count: infinite;\n}\n\n.pulse {\n  @include inline-animation(2s) {\n    from { background-color: yellow }\n    to { background-color: red }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@mixin inline-animation($duration)\n  $name: inline-#{unique-id()}\n\n  @keyframes #{$name}\n    @content\n\n  animation-name: $name\n  animation-duration: $duration\n  animation-iteration-count: infinite\n\n.pulse\n  @include inline-animation(2s)\n    from\n      background-color: yellow\n    to\n      background-color: red\n```\n\n## CSS Output\n\n```css\n.pulse {\n  animation-name: inline-uifpe6h;\n  animation-duration: 2s;\n  animation-iteration-count: infinite;\n}\n@keyframes inline-uifpe6h {\n  from {\n    background-color: yellow;\n  }\n  to {\n    background-color: red;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Fun fact\n\nInterpolation is useful for injecting values into strings, but other than that it’s rarely necessary in SassScript expressions. You definitely don’t need it to just use a variable in a property value. Instead of writing `color: #{$accent}`, you can just write `color: $accent`!\n\n## Heads up\n\nIt’s almost always a bad idea to use interpolation with numbers. Interpolation returns unquoted strings that can’t be used for any further math, and it avoids Sass’s built-in safeguards to ensure that units are used correctly.\n\n## Quoted Strings\n\nIn most cases, interpolation injects the exact same text that would be used if the expression were used as a property value. But there is one exception: the quotation marks around quoted strings are removed.\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n.example {\n  unquoted: #{\"string\"};\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n.example\n  unquoted: #{\"string\"}\n```\n\n## CSS Output\n\n```css\n.example {\n  unquoted: string;\n}\n```\n\n## Heads up\n\nWhile it’s tempting to use this feature to convert quoted strings to unquoted strings, it’s a lot clearer to use the `string.unquote()` function.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/interpolation", "title": "Interpolation", "description": "Interpolation can be used almost anywhere in a Sass stylesheet to embed the result of a SassScript expression into a chunk of CSS.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 14, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 22:02:28", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"description": "Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets", "title": "Sass: Interpolation", "language": "en", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "favicon": "https://sass-lang.com/icon.png", "scrapeId": "83ce1e5c-30c1-467a-a452-f118890f1374", "sourceURL": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/interpolation", "url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/interpolation/", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Operators is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Operators in sass.\n\n# Operators\n\nSass supports a handful of useful operators for working with different values, including mathematical, equality, relational, boolean, and string operators.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Operators Overview\n\nSass supports a handful of useful `operators` for working with different values. These include the standard mathematical operators like `+` and `*`, as well as operators for various other types:\n\n- [`==` and `!=`](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/operators/equality) are used to check if two values are the same.\n- [`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%`](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/operators/numeric) have their usual mathematical meaning for numbers, with special behaviors for units that matches the use of units in scientific math.\n- [`<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=`](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/operators/relational) check whether two numbers are greater or less than one another.\n- [`and`, `or`, and `not`](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/operators/boolean) have the usual boolean behavior. Sass considers every value \"true\" except for `false` and `null`.\n- [`+`, `-`, and `/`](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/operators/string) can be used to concatenate strings.\n\n## Heads up!\n\nEarly on in Sass’s history, it added support for mathematical operations on [colors](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/colors). These operations operated on each of the colors’ RGB channels separately, so adding two colors would produce a color with the sum of their red channels as its red channel and so on.\n\nThis behavior wasn’t very useful, since channel-by-channel RGB arithmetic didn’t correspond well to how humans perceive color. [Color functions](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/color) were added which are much more useful, and color operations were deprecated. They’re still supported in LibSass and Ruby Sass, but they’ll produce warnings and users are strongly encouraged to avoid them.\n\n## Order of Operations\n\nSass has a pretty standard [order of operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations#Programming_languages), from tightest to loosest:\n\n1. The unary operators [`not`](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/operators/boolean), [`+`, `-`](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/operators/numeric#unary-operators), and [`/`](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/operators/string#unary-operators).\n2. The [`*`, `/`, and `%` operators](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/operators/numeric).\n3. The [`+` and `-` operators](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/operators/numeric).\n4. The [`>`, `>=`, `<` and `<=` operators](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/operators/relational).\n5. The [`==` and `!=` operators](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/operators/equality).\n6. The [`and` operator](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/operators/boolean).\n7. The [`or` operator](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/operators/boolean).\n8. The [`=` operator](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/operators/#single-equals), when it’s available.\n\n## SCSS Syntax Example\n\n```scss\n@debug 1 + 2 * 3 == 1 + (2 * 3); // true\n@debug true or false and false == true or (false and false); // true\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax Example\n\n```sass\n@debug 1 + 2 * 3 == 1 + (2 * 3)  // true\n@debug true or false and false == true or (false and false)  // true\n```\n\n## Parentheses\n\nYou can explicitly control the order of operations using parentheses. An operation inside parentheses is always evaluated before any operations outside of them. Parentheses can even be nested, in which case the innermost parentheses will be evaluated first.\n\n## SCSS Syntax with Parentheses\n\n```scss\n@debug (1 + 2) * 3; // 9\n@debug ((1 + 2) * 3 + 4) * 5; // 65\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax with Parentheses\n\n```sass\n@debug (1 + 2) * 3  // 9\n@debug ((1 + 2) * 3 + 4) * 5  // 65\n```\n\n## Single Equals\n\nSass supports a special `=` operator that’s only allowed in function arguments, which just creates an [unquoted string](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/strings#unquoted) with its two operands separated by `=`. This exists for backwards-compatibility with very old IE-only syntax.\n\n## SCSS Syntax for Single Equals\n\n```scss\n.transparent-blue {\n  filter: chroma(color=#0000ff);\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax for Single Equals\n\n```sass\n.transparent-blue\n  filter: chroma(color=#0000ff)\n```\n\n## CSS Output for Single Equals\n\n```css\n.transparent-blue {\n  filter: chroma(color=#0000ff);\n}\n```\n\n## Current Releases\n\n- [Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass) [1.85.1](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases/tag/1.85.1)\n- [LibSass](https://sass-lang.com/libsass) [3.6.6](https://github.com/sass/libsass/releases/tag/3.6.6)\n- [Ruby Sass](https://sass-lang.com/ruby-sass) ⚰\n- [Implementation Guide](https://sass-lang.com/implementation)\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/operators", "title": "Operators", "description": "Sass supports a handful of useful operators for working with different values, including mathematical, equality, relational, boolean, and string operators.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 13, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 22:03:19", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"title": "Sass: Operators", "favicon": "https://sass-lang.com/icon.png", "description": "Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "language": "en", "scrapeId": "2a1db1d7-17eb-4123-b245-19b9833c8c49", "sourceURL": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/operators", "url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/operators/", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Sass Variables is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Sass Variables in sass.\n\n# Sass Variables\n\nSass variables are simple: you assign a value to a name that begins with `$`, and then you can refer to that name instead of the value itself. They are one of the most useful tools Sass brings to the table, allowing for reduced repetition, complex math, and library configuration.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Variables\n\nSass variables are simple: you assign a value to a name that begins with `$`, and then you can refer to that name instead of the value itself. But despite their simplicity, they’re one of the most useful tools Sass brings to the table. Variables make it possible to reduce repetition, do complex math, configure libraries, and much more.\n\nA variable declaration looks a lot like a property declaration: it’s written `<variable>: <expression>`. Unlike a property, which can only be declared in a style rule or at-rule, variables can be declared anywhere you want. To use a variable, just include it in a value.\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n$base-color: #c6538c;\n$border-dark: rgba($base-color, 0.88);\n\n.alert {\n  border: 1px solid $border-dark;\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n$base-color: #c6538c\n$border-dark: rgba($base-color, 0.88)\n\n.alert\n  border: 1px solid $border-dark\n```\n\n## CSS Output\n\n```css\n.alert {\n  border: 1px solid rgba(198, 83, 140, 0.88);\n}\n```\n\n## Heads up!\n\nCSS has variables of its own, which are totally different than Sass variables. Know the differences!\n\n- Sass variables are all compiled away by Sass. CSS variables are included in the CSS output.\n- CSS variables can have different values for different elements, but Sass variables only have one value at a time.\n- Sass variables are imperative, which means if you use a variable and then change its value, the earlier use will stay the same. CSS variables are declarative, which means if you change the value, it’ll affect both earlier uses and later uses.\n\n## Default Values\n\nNormally when you assign a value to a variable, if that variable already had a value, its old value is overwritten. But if you’re writing a Sass library, you might want to allow your users to configure your library’s variables before you use them to generate CSS.\n\nTo make this possible, Sass provides the `!default` flag. This assigns a value to a variable only if that variable isn’t defined or its value is null. Otherwise, the existing value will be used.\n\n## Configuring Modules\n\nOnly Dart Sass currently supports `@use`. Users of other implementations must use the `@import` rule instead.\n\nVariables defined with `!default` can be configured when loading a module with the `@use` rule. Sass libraries often use `!default` variables to allow their users to configure the library’s CSS.\n\n## Built-in Variables\n\nVariables that are defined by a built-in module cannot be modified.\n\n## Scope\n\nVariables declared at the top level of a stylesheet are global. This means that they can be accessed anywhere in their module after they’ve been declared. But that’s not true for all variables. Those declared in blocks are usually local, and can only be accessed within the block they were declared.\n\n## Shadowing\n\nLocal variables can even be declared with the same name as a global variable. If this happens, there are actually two different variables with the same name: one local and one global.\n\n## Flow Control Scope\n\nVariables declared in flow control rules have special scoping rules: they don’t shadow variables at the same level as the flow control rule. Instead, they just assign to those variables.\n\n## Advanced Variable Functions\n\nThe Sass core library provides a couple advanced functions for working with variables. The `meta.variable-exists()` function returns whether a variable with the given name exists in the current scope, and the `meta.global-variable-exists()` function does the same but only for the global scope.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/variables", "title": "Sass Variables", "description": "Sass variables are simple: you assign a value to a name that begins with `$`, and then you can refer to that name instead of the value itself.

But if you’re writing a Sass library, you might want to allow your users to configure your library’s variables before you use them to generate CSS.\n\nTo make this possible, Sass provides the `!default` flag.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Sass Syntax is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Sass Syntax in sass.\n\n# Sass Syntax\n\nSass supports two different syntaxes: SCSS and the Indented Syntax, each with its own characteristics and use cases.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## SCSS\n\nThe SCSS syntax uses the file extension `.scss`. With a few small exceptions, it’s a superset of CSS, which means essentially **all valid CSS is valid SCSS as** **well**. Because of its similarity to CSS, it’s the easiest syntax to get used to and the most popular.\n\nSCSS looks like this:\n\n```scss\n@mixin button-base() {\n  @include typography(button);\n  @include ripple-surface;\n  @include ripple-radius-bounded;\n\n  display: inline-flex;\n  position: relative;\n  height: $button-height;\n  border: none;\n  vertical-align: middle;\n\n  &:hover {\n    cursor: pointer;\n  }\n\n  &:disabled {\n    color: $mdc-button-disabled-ink-color;\n    cursor: default;\n    pointer-events: none;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## The Indented Syntax\n\nThe indented syntax was Sass’s original syntax, so it uses the file extension `.sass`.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Style Rules is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Style Rules in sass.\n\n# Style Rules\n\nStyle rules are the foundation of Sass, just like they are for CSS. And they work the same way: you choose which elements to style with a selector, and declare properties that affect how those elements look.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n.button {\n  padding: 3px 10px;\n  font-size: 12px;\n  border-radius: 3px;\n  border: 1px solid #e1e4e8;\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n.button\n  padding: 3px 10px\n  font-size: 12px\n  border-radius: 3px\n  border: 1px solid #e1e4e8\n```\n\n## CSS Output\n\n```css\n.button {\n  padding: 3px 10px;\n  font-size: 12px;\n  border-radius: 3px;\n  border: 1px solid #e1e4e8;\n}\n```\n\n## Nesting\n\nBut Sass wants to make your life easier. Rather than repeating the same selectors over and over again, you can write one style rules inside another. Sass will automatically combine the outer rule’s selector with the inner rule’s.\n\n### SCSS Syntax\n```scss\nnav {\n  ul {\n    margin: 0;\n    padding: 0;\n    list-style: none;\n  }\n\n  li { display: inline-block; }\n\n  a {\n    display: block;\n    padding: 6px 12px;\n    text-decoration: none;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Sass Syntax\n```sass\nnav\n  ul\n    margin: 0\n    padding: 0\n    list-style: none\n\n  li\n    display: inline-block\n\n  a\n    display: block\n    padding: 6px 12px\n    text-decoration: none\n```\n\n### CSS Output\n```css\nnav ul {\n  margin: 0;\n  padding: 0;\n  list-style: none;\n}\nnav li {\n  display: inline-block;\n}\nnav a {\n  display: block;\n  padding: 6px 12px;\n  text-decoration: none;\n}\n```\n\n## ⚠️ Heads up!\n\nNested rules are super helpful, but they can also make it hard to visualize how much CSS you’re actually generating. The deeper you nest, the more bandwidth it takes to serve your CSS and the more work it takes the browser to render it. Keep those selectors shallow!\n\n## Selector Lists\n\nNested rules are clever about handling selector lists (that is, comma-separated selectors). Each complex selector (the ones between the commas) is nested separately, and then they’re combined back into a selector list.\n\n### SCSS Syntax\n```scss\n.alert, .warning {\n  ul, p {\n    margin-right: 0;\n    margin-left: 0;\n    padding-bottom: 0;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Sass Syntax\n```sass\n.alert, .warning\n  ul, p\n    margin-right: 0\n    margin-left: 0\n    padding-bottom: 0\n```\n\n### CSS Output\n```css\n.alert ul, .alert p, .warning ul, .warning p {\n  margin-right: 0;\n  margin-left: 0;\n  padding-bottom: 0;\n}\n```\n\n## Selector Combinators\n\nYou can nest selectors that use combinators as well. You can put the combinator at the end of the outer selector, at the beginning of the inner selector, or even all on its own in between the two.\n\n### SCSS Syntax\n```scss\nul > {\n  li {\n    list-style-type: none;\n  }\n}\n\nh2 {\n  + p {\n    border-top: 1px solid gray;\n  }\n}\n\np {\n  ~ {\n    span {\n      opacity: 0.8;\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Sass Syntax\n```sass\nul >\n  li\n    list-style-type: none\n\nh2\n  + p\n    border-top: 1px solid gray\n\np\n  ~\n    span\n      opacity: 0.8\n```\n\n### CSS Output\n```css\nul > li {\n  list-style-type: none;\n}\nh2 + p {\n  border-top: 1px solid gray;\n}\np ~ span {\n  opacity: 0.8;\n}\n```\n\n## Advanced Nesting\n\nIf you want to do more with your nested style rules than just combine them in order with the descendant combinator (that is, a plain space) separating them, Sass has your back. See the parent selector documentation for more details.\n\n## Interpolation\n\nYou can use interpolation to inject values from expressions like variables and function calls into your selectors. This is particularly useful when you’re writing mixins, since it allows you to create selectors from parameters your users pass in.\n\n### SCSS Syntax\n```scss\n@mixin define-emoji($name, $glyph) {\n  span.emoji-#{$name} {\n    font-family: IconFont;\n    font-variant: normal;\n    font-weight: normal;\n    content: $glyph;\n  }\n}\n\n@include define-emoji(\"women-holding-hands\", \"👭\");\n```\n\n### Sass Syntax\n```sass\n@mixin define-emoji($name, $glyph)\n  span.emoji-#{$name}\n    font-family: IconFont\n    font-variant: normal\n    font-weight: normal\n    content: $glyph\n\n@include define-emoji(\"women-holding-hands\", \"👭\")\n```\n\n### CSS Output\n```css\n@charset \"UTF-8\";\nspan.emoji-women-holding-hands {\n  font-family: IconFont;\n  font-variant: normal;\n  font-weight: normal;\n  content: \"👭\";\n}\n```\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/style-rules", "title": "Style Rules", "description": "Style rules are the foundation of Sass, just like they are for CSS.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Booleans is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Booleans in sass.\n\n# Booleans\n\nBooleans are the logical values `true` and `false`. In addition their literal forms, booleans are returned by equality and relational operators, as well as many built-in functions.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@use \"sass:math\";\n\n@debug 1px == 2px; // false\n@debug 1px == 1px; // true\n@debug 10px < 3px; // false\n@debug math.comparable(100px, 3in); // true\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@use \"sass:math\"\n\n@debug 1px == 2px  // false\n@debug 1px == 1px  // true\n@debug 10px < 3px  // false\n@debug math.comparable(100px, 3in)  // true\n```\n\n## Using Booleans\n\nYou can use booleans to choose whether or not to do various things in Sass. The `@if` rule evaluates a block of styles if its argument is `true`:\n\n### SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@use \"sass:math\";\n\n@mixin avatar($size, $circle: false) {\n  width: $size;\n  height: $size;\n\n  @if $circle {\n    border-radius: math.div($size, 2);\n  }\n}\n\n.square-av {\n  @include avatar(100px, $circle: false);\n}\n.circle-av {\n  @include avatar(100px, $circle: true);\n}\n```\n\n### Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@use \"sass:math\"\n\n@mixin avatar($size, $circle: false)\n  width: $size\n  height: $size\n\n  @if $circle\n    border-radius: math.div($size, 2)\n\n.square-av\n  @include avatar(100px, $circle: false)\n\n.circle-av\n  @include avatar(100px, $circle: true)\n```\n\n## CSS Output\n\n```css\n.square-av {\n  width: 100px;\n  height: 100px;\n}\n\n.circle-av {\n  width: 100px;\n  height: 100px;\n  border-radius: 50px;\n}\n```\n\n## Truthiness and Falsiness\n\nAnywhere `true` or `false` are allowed, you can use other values as well. The values `false` and `null` are falsey, which means Sass considers them to indicate falsehood and cause conditions to fail. Every other value is considered truthy, so Sass considers them to work like `true` and cause conditions to succeed.\n\nFor example, if you want to check if a string contains a space, you can just write `string.index($string, \" \")`. The `string.index()` function returns `null` if the string isn’t found and a number otherwise.\n\n### ⚠️ Heads up!\n\nSome languages consider more values falsey than just `false` and `null`. Sass isn’t one of those languages! Empty strings, empty lists, and the number `0` are all truthy in Sass.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/booleans", "title": "Booleans", "description": "Booleans are the logical values `true` and `false`.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: How do I truthiness and falsiness in sass?\n\nAssistant: To truthiness and falsiness in sass, here's what you do:\nAnywhere `true` or `false` are allowed, you can use other values as well. The values `false` and `null` are falsey, which means Sass considers them to indicate falsehood and cause conditions to fail. Every other value is considered truthy, so Sass considers them to work like `true` and cause conditions to succeed.\n\nFor example, if you want to check if a string contains a space, you can just write `string.index($string, \" \")`. The `string.index()` function returns `null` if the string isn’t found and a number otherwise.\n\n### ⚠️ Heads up!\n\nSome languages consider more values falsey than just `false` and `null`. Sass isn’t one of those languages!

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Strings is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Strings in sass.\n\n# Strings\n\nStrings are sequences of characters (specifically Unicode code points). Sass supports two kinds of strings whose internal structure is the same but which are rendered differently: quoted strings and unquoted strings.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Fun fact\n\nYou can convert a quoted string to an unquoted string using the string.unquote() function, and you can convert an unquoted string to a quoted string using the string.quote() function.\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@use \"sass:string\";\n\n@debug string.unquote(\".widget:hover\"); // .widget:hover\n@debug string.quote(bold); // \"bold\"\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@use \"sass:string\"\n\n@debug string.unquote(\".widget:hover\")  // .widget:hover\n@debug string.quote(bold)  // \"bold\"\n```\n\n## Escapes\n\nAll Sass strings support the standard CSS escape codes:\n\n- Any character other than a letter from A to F or a number from 0 to 9 (even a newline!) can be included as part of a string by writing `\\` in front of it.\n- Any character can be included as part of a string by writing `\\` followed by its Unicode code point number written in hexadecimal. You can optionally include a space after the code point number to indicate where the Unicode number ends.\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@debug \"\\\"\"; // '\"'\n@debug \\.widget; // \\.widget\n@debug \"\\a\"; // \"\\a\" (a string containing only a newline)\n@debug \"line1\\a line2\"; // \"line1\\a line2\"\n@debug \"Nat + Liz \\1F46D\"; // \"Nat + Liz 👭\"\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@debug \"\\\"\"  // '\"'\n@debug \\.widget  // \\.widget\n@debug \"\\a\"  // \"\\a\" (a string containing only a newline)\n@debug \"line1\\a line2\"  // \"line1\\a line2\" (foo and bar are separated by a newline)\n@debug \"Nat + Liz \\1F46D\"  // \"Nat + Liz 👭\"\n```\n\n## Fun fact\n\nFor characters that are allowed to appear in strings, writing the Unicode escape produces exactly the same string as writing the character itself.\n\n## Quoted\n\nQuoted strings are written between either single or double quotes, as in \"Helvetica Neue\". They can contain interpolation, as well as any unescaped character except for:\n\n- `\\`, which can be escaped as `\\\\`;\n- `'` or `\"`, whichever was used to define that string, which can be escaped as `\\'` or `\\\"`;\n- newlines, which can be escaped as `\\a ` (including a trailing space).\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@debug \"Helvetica Neue\"; // \"Helvetica Neue\"\n@debug \"C:\\\\Program Files\"; // \"C:\\\\Program Files\"\n@debug \"\\\"Don't Fear the Reaper\\\"\"; // \"\\\"Don't Fear the Reaper\\\"\"\n@debug \"line1\\a line2\"; // \"line1\\a line2\"\n\n$roboto-variant: \"Mono\";\n@debug \"Roboto #{$roboto-variant}\"; // \"Roboto Mono\"\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@debug \"Helvetica Neue\"  // \"Helvetica Neue\"\n@debug \"C:\\\\Program Files\"  // \"C:\\\\Program Files\"\n@debug \"\\\"Don't Fear the Reaper\\\"\"  // \"\\\"Don't Fear the Reaper\\\"\"\n@debug \"line1\\a line2\"  // \"line1\\a line2\"\n\n$roboto-variant: \"Mono\"\n@debug \"Roboto #{$roboto-variant}\"  // \"Roboto Mono\"\n```\n\n## Fun fact\n\nWhen a quoted string is injected into another value via interpolation, its quotes are removed! This makes it easy to write strings containing selectors, for example, that can be injected into style rules without adding quotes.\n\n## Unquoted\n\nUnquoted strings are written as CSS identifiers, following the syntax diagram below. They may include interpolation anywhere.\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@debug bold; // bold\n@debug -webkit-flex; // -webkit-flex\n@debug --123; // --123\n\n$prefix: ms;\n@debug -#{$prefix}-flex; // -ms-flex\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@debug bold  // bold\n@debug -webkit-flex  // -webkit-flex\n@debug --123  // --123\n\n$prefix: ms\n@debug -#{$prefix}-flex  // -ms-flex\n```\n\n## Heads up!\n\nNot all identifiers are parsed as unquoted strings:\n\n- CSS color names are parsed as colors.\n- `null` is parsed as Sass’s `null` value.\n- `true` and `false` are parsed as Booleans.\n- `not`, `and`, and `or` are parsed as Boolean operators.\n\nBecause of this, it’s generally a good idea to write quoted strings unless you’re specifically writing the value of a CSS property that uses unquoted strings.\n\n## Escapes in Unquoted Strings\n\nDart Sass since 1.11.0\n\nLibSass✗\n\nRuby Sass✗\n\nLibSass, Ruby Sass, and older versions of Dart Sass don’t normalize escapes in identifiers. Instead, the text in the unquoted string is the exact text the user wrote. For example, `\\1F46D` and `👭` are not considered equivalent.\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@use \"sass:string\";\n\n@debug \\1F46D; // 👭\n@debug \\21; // \\!\n@debug \\7Fx; // \\7f x\n@debug string.length(\\7Fx); // 5\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@use \"sass:string\"\n\n@debug \\1F46D  // 👭\n@debug \\21  // \\!\n@debug \\7Fx  // \\7f x\n@debug string.length(\\7Fx)  // 5\n```\n\n## String Indexes\n\nSass has a number of string functions that take or return numbers, called indexes, that refer to the characters in a string. The index 1 indicates the first character of the string. Note that this is different than many programming languages where indexes start at 0! Sass also makes it easy to refer to the end of a string. The index -1 refers to the last character in a string, -2 refers to the second-to-last, and so on.\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@use \"sass:string\";\n\n@debug string.index(\"Helvetica Neue\", \"Helvetica\"); // 1\n@debug string.index(\"Helvetica Neue\", \"Neue\"); // 11\n@debug string.slice(\"Roboto Mono\", -4); // \"Mono\"\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@use \"sass:string\"\n\n@debug string.index(\"Helvetica Neue\", \"Helvetica\")  // 1\n@debug string.index(\"Helvetica Neue\", \"Neue\")  // 11\n@debug string.slice(\"Roboto Mono\", -4)  // \"Mono\"\n```\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/strings", "title": "Strings", "description": "Strings are sequences of characters (specifically Unicode code points).

This makes it easy to write strings containing selectors, for example, that can be injected into style rules without adding quotes.\n\nBecause of this, it’s generally a good idea to write quoted strings unless you’re specifically writing the value of a CSS property that uses unquoted strings.\n\nStick to these, and you'll avoid a lot of headaches!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/strings", "title": "Strings", "description": "Strings are sequences of characters (specifically Unicode code points).

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Equality Operators is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Equality Operators in sass.\n\n# Equality Operators\n\nThis page covers the equality operators in Sass, detailing how they work with different data types and providing examples of their usage.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Compatibility (Unitless Equality)\n\nDart Sass✓\n\nLibSass✗\n\nRuby Sass since 4.0.0 (unreleased)\n\nLibSass and older versions of Ruby Sass consider numbers without units to be equal to the same numbers with any units. This behavior was deprecated and has been removed from more recently releases because it violates transitivity.\n\n## Equality Operators\n\nThe equality operators return whether or not two values are the same. They’re written `<expression> == <expression>`, which returns whether two expressions are equal, and `<expression> != <expression>`, which returns whether two expressions are _not_ equal. Two values are considered equal if they’re the same type _and_ the same value, which means different things for different types:\n\n- Numbers are equal if they have the same value _and_ the same units, or if their values are equal when their units are converted between one another.\n- Strings are unusual in that unquoted and quoted strings with the same contents are considered equal.\n- Colors are equal if they’re in the same color space and have the same channel values, _or_ if they’re both in legacy color spaces and have the same RGBA channel values.\n- Lists are equal if their contents are equal. Comma-separated lists aren’t equal to space-separated lists, and bracketed lists aren’t equal to unbracketed lists.\n- Maps are equal if their keys and values are both equal.\n- Calculations are equal if their names and arguments are all equal. Operation arguments are compared textually.\n- `true`, `false`, and `null` are only equal to themselves.\n- Functions are equal to the same function. Functions are compared _by_ reference, so even if two functions have the same name and definition they’re considered different if they aren’t defined in the same place.\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@debug 1px == 1px; // true\n@debug 1px != 1em; // true\n@debug 1 != 1px; // true\n@debug 96px == 1in; // true\n\n@debug \"Helvetica\" == Helvetica; // true\n@debug \"Helvetica\" != \"Arial\"; // true\n\n@debug hsl(34, 35%, 92.1%) == #f2ece4; // true\n@debug rgba(179, 115, 153, 0.5) != rgba(179, 115, 153, 0.8); // true\n\n@debug (5px 7px 10px) == (5px 7px 10px); // true\n@debug (5px 7px 10px) != (10px 14px 20px); // true\n@debug (5px 7px 10px) != (5px, 7px, 10px); // true\n@debug (5px 7px 10px) != [5px 7px 10px]; // true\n\n$theme: (\"venus\": #998099, \"nebula\": #d2e1dd);\n@debug $theme == (\"venus\": #998099, \"nebula\": #d2e1dd); // true\n@debug $theme != (\"venus\": #998099, \"iron\": #dadbdf); // true\n\n@debug true == true; // true\n@debug true != false; // true\n@debug null != false; // true\n\n@debug get-function(\"rgba\") == get-function(\"rgba\"); // true\n@debug get-function(\"rgba\") != get-function(\"hsla\"); // true\n```\n\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@debug 1px == 1px  // true\n@debug 1px != 1em  // true\n@debug 1 != 1px  // true\n@debug 96px == 1in  // true\n\n@debug \"Helvetica\" == Helvetica  // true\n@debug \"Helvetica\" != \"Arial\"  // true\n\n@debug hsl(34, 35%, 92.1%) == #f2ece4  // true\n@debug rgba(179, 115, 153, 0.5) != rgba(179, 115, 153, 0.8)  // true\n\n@debug (5px 7px 10px) == (5px 7px 10px)  // true\n@debug (5px 7px 10px) != (10px 14px 20px)  // true\n@debug (5px 7px 10px) != (5px, 7px, 10px)  // true\n@debug (5px 7px 10px) != [5px 7px 10px]  // true\n\n$theme: (\"venus\": #998099, \"nebula\": #d2e1dd)\n@debug $theme == (\"venus\": #998099, \"nebula\": #d2e1dd)  // true\n@debug $theme != (\"venus\": #998099, \"iron\": #dadbdf)  // true\n\n@debug calc(10px + 10%) == calc(10px + 10%)  // true\n@debug calc(10% + 10px) == calc(10px + 10%)  // false\n\n@debug true == true  // true\n@debug true != false  // true\n@debug null != false  // true\n\n@debug get-function(\"rgba\") == get-function(\"rgba\")  // true\n@debug get-function(\"rgba\") != get-function(\"hsla\")  // true\n```\n\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/operators/equality", "title": "Equality Operators", "description": "This page covers the equality operators in Sass, detailing how they work with different data types and providing examples of their usage.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 4, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 22:31:16", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"description": "Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets", "language": "en", "favicon": "https://sass-lang.com/icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "title": "Sass: Equality Operators", "scrapeId": "05f016b1-12c1-4885-88ed-c9877234292f", "sourceURL": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/operators/equality", "url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/operators/equality/", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Breaking Changes is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Breaking Changes in sass.\n\n# Breaking Changes\n\nThis page outlines the breaking changes in Sass, including deprecation warnings and changes in behavior for various features.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Breaking Changes Overview\n\nNew versions of Sass are as backwards-compatible as possible, but sometimes a breaking change is necessary. Sass needs to keep up with the evolving CSS specification, and old language design mistakes occasionally need to be fixed. Before each breaking change is released, Sass implementations will produce deprecation warnings for stylesheets whose behavior will change. Whenever possible, these warnings will include suggestions for how to update the deprecated styles to make them forward-compatible.\n\n## Implementation Policies\n\nDifferent implementations have different policies for breaking changes and deprecations. Dart Sass will emit deprecation warnings for at least three months before releasing a breaking change, and will release the breaking change with a new major version number unless that change is necessary for CSS compatibility. CSS compatibility changes are often both non-disruptive and time-sensitive, so they may be released with new minor version numbers instead.\n\n## Recent and Upcoming Breaking Changes\n\nThese breaking changes are coming soon or have recently been released:\n\n- The legacy JSAPI beginning in Dart Sass 1.79.0.\n- Certain uses of the JS color API are deprecated beginning in Dart Sass 1.79.0.\n- A number of color functions are deprecated beginning in Dart Sass 1.79.0, in favor of new CSS Color 4-compatible functions.\n- The `meta.feature-exists()` function is deprecated beginning in Dart Sass 1.78.0.\n- Mixing declarations with nested rules is changing behavior beginning in Dart Sass 1.77.7.\n- Functions and Mixins Beginning with `--` are deprecated beginning in Dart Sass 1.76.0.\n- Passing a percentage unit to the global `abs()` is deprecated beginning in Dart Sass 1.65.0.\n- Passing `null` as an alpha channel to `new SassColor()` is changing behavior beginning in Dart Sass 1.64.3.\n- Loading Sass as a default export in JS is no longer allowed beginning in Dart Sass 1.63.0.\n- A variable may only have a single `!global` or `!default` flag beginning in Dart Sass 1.62.0.\n- Selectors with invalid combinators are invalid beginning in Dart Sass 1.54.0.\n- `/` is changing from a division operation to a list separator beginning in Dart Sass 1.33.0.\n- Functions are stricter about which units they allow beginning in Dart Sass 1.32.0.\n- Parsing the special syntax of `@-moz-document` will be invalid beginning in Dart Sass 1.7.2.\n- Compound selectors could not be extended in Dart Sass 1.0.0 and Ruby Sass 4.0.0.\n- The syntax for CSS custom property values changed in Dart Sass 1.0.0, LibSass 3.5.0, and Ruby Sass 3.5.0.\n\n## Early Opt-In\n\nDart Sass users can opt in to treat deprecations as errors early using the `--fatal-deprecation` command line option.\n\n## Current Releases\n\n- Dart Sass 1.85.1\n- LibSass 3.6.6\n- Ruby Sass ⚰\n- Implementation Guide\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes", "title": "Breaking Changes", "description": "This page outlines the breaking changes in Sass, including deprecation warnings and changes in behavior for various features.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 5, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 22:42:02", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"description": "Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "language": "en", "title": "Sass: Breaking Changes", "favicon": "https://sass-lang.com/icon.png", "scrapeId": "2967c307-372c-4f94-9c19-689bd20397ff", "sourceURL": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes", "url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Comments is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Comments in sass.\n\n# Comments\n\nThe way Sass comments work differs substantially between SCSS and the indented syntax. Both syntaxes support two types of comments: comments defined using `/* */` that are (usually) compiled to CSS, and comments defined using `//` that are not.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## In SCSS\n\nComments in SCSS work similarly to comments in other languages like JavaScript. **Single-line comments** start with `//`, and go until the end of the line. Nothing in a single-line comment is emitted as CSS; as far as Sass is concerned, they may as well not exist. They’re also called **silent comments**, because they don’t produce any CSS.\n\n**Multi-line comments** start with `/*` and end at the next `*/`. If a multi-line comment is written somewhere that a [statement](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax/structure#statements) is allowed, it’s compiled to a CSS comment. They’re also called **loud comment**, by contrast with silent comments. A multi-line comment that’s compiled to CSS may contain [interpolation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/interpolation), which will be evaluated before the comment is compiled.\n\nBy default, multi-line comments will be stripped from the compiled CSS in [compressed mode](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass/#style). If a comment begins with `/*!`, though, it will always be included in the CSS output.\n\n## In Sass\n\nComments in the indented syntax work a little differently: they’re indentation-based, just like the rest of the syntax. Like SCSS, silent comments written with `//` are never emitted as CSS, but unlike SCSS everything indented beneath the opening `//` is also commented out.\n\nIndented syntax comments that start with `/*` work with indentation the same way, except that they are compiled to CSS. Because the extent of the comment is based on indentation, the closing `*/` is optional. Also like SCSS, `/*` comments can contain [interpolation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/interpolation) and can start with `/*!` to avoid being stripped in compressed mode.\n\nComments can also be used within [expressions](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax/structure#expressions) in the indented syntax. In this case, they have exactly the same syntax as they do in SCSS.\n\n## Documentation Comments\n\nWhen writing style libraries using Sass, you can use comments to document the [mixins](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/mixin), [functions](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/function), [variables](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/variables), and [placeholder selectors](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/style-rules/placeholder-selectors) that your library provides, as well as the library itself. These comments are read by the [SassDoc](http://sassdoc.com/) tool, which uses them to generate beautiful documentation. Check out [the Susy grid engine](http://oddbird.net/susy/docs/index.html)’s documentation to see it in action!\n\nDocumentation comments are silent comments, written with three slashes ( `///`) directly above the thing you’re documenting.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what sass:color is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain sass:color in sass.\n\n# sass:color\n\nThis documentation page covers the built-in color functions available in Sass, including how to adjust, change, and manipulate colors using various methods and parameters.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Compatibility\n\nDart Sass since 1.23.0\n\nLibSass ✗\n\nRuby Sass ✗\n\nOnly Dart Sass currently supports loading built-in modules with `@use`. Users of other implementations must call functions using their global names instead.\n\n## Function: color.adjust()\n\nIncreases or decreases one or more channels of `$color` by fixed amounts. Adds the value passed for each keyword argument to the corresponding channel of the color, and returns the adjusted color. By default, this can only adjust channels in `$color`’s space, but a different color space can be passed as `$space` to adjust channels there instead. This always returns a color in the same space as `$color`.\n\n## Heads up!\n\nFor historical reasons, if `$color` is in a legacy color space, any legacy color space channels can be adjusted. However, it’s an error to specify an RGB channel (`$red`, `$green`, and/or `$blue`) at the same time as an HSL channel (`$hue`, `$saturation`, and/or `$lightness`), or either of those at the same time as an HWB channel (`$hue`, `$whiteness`, and/or `$blackness`). Even so, it’s a good idea to pass `$space` explicitly even for legacy colors.\n\n## Function: color.change()\n\nSets one or more channels of a color to new values. Uses the value passed for each keyword argument in place of the corresponding color channel, and returns the changed color. By default, this can only change channels in `$color`’s space, but a different color space can be passed as `$space` to adjust channels there instead. This always returns a color in the same space as `$color`.\n\n## Function: color.channel()\n\nReturns the value of `$channel` in `$space`, which defaults to `$color`’s space. The `$channel` must be a quoted string, and the `$space` must be an unquoted string.\n\n## Function: color.complement()\n\nReturns the complement of `$color` in `$space`. This rotates `$color`’s hue by `180deg` in `$space`. This means that `$space` has to be a polar color space: `hsl`, `hwb`, `lch`, or `oklch`. It always returns a color in the same space as `$color`.\n\n## Function: color.grayscale()\n\nReturns a gray color with the same lightness as `$color`. If `$color` is in a legacy color space, this sets the HSL saturation to 0%. Otherwise, it sets the Oklch chroma to 0%.\n\n## Function: color.ie-hex-str()\n\nReturns an unquoted string that represents `$color` in the `#AARRGGBB` format expected by Internet Explorer’s `-ms-filter` property.\n\n## Function: color.invert()\n\nReturns the inverse or negative of `$color` in `$space`. The `$weight` must be a number between `0%` and `100%` (inclusive). A higher weight means the result will be closer to the negative, and a lower weight means it will be closer to `$color`. Weight `50%` will always produce a medium-lightness gray in `$space`.\n\n## Function: color.is-legacy()\n\nReturns whether `$color` is in a legacy colorspace.\n\n## Function: color.is-missing()\n\nReturns whether `$channel` is missing in `$color`. The `$channel` must be a quoted string.\n\n## Function: color.is-powerless()\n\nReturns whether `$color`’s `$channel` is powerless in `$space`, which defaults to `$color`’s space.\n\n## Function: color.mix()\n\nReturns a color that’s a mixture of `$color1` and `$color2` using `$method`, which is the name of a color space, optionally followed by a hue interpolation method if it’s a polar color space.\n\n## Function: color.same()\n\nReturns whether `$color1` and `$color2` visually render as the same color.\n\n## Function: color.scale()\n\nFluidly scales one or more properties of `$color`. Each keyword argument must be a number between `-100%` and `100%` (inclusive). This indicates how far the corresponding property should be moved from its original position towards the maximum (if the argument is positive) or the minimum (if the argument is negative).\n\n## Function: color.space()\n\nReturns the name of `$color`’s space as an unquoted string.\n\n## Function: color.to-gamut()\n\nReturns a visually similar color to `$color` in the gamut of `$space`, which defaults to `$color`’s space.\n\n## Function: color.to-space()\n\nConverts `$color` into the given `$space`, which must be an unquoted string.\n\n## Deprecated Functions\n\nIncreases or decreases `$color`’s HSL hue. The `$hue` must be a number between `-360deg` and `360deg` (inclusive) to add to `$color`’s hue.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/color", "title": "sass:color", "description": "This documentation page covers the built-in color functions available in Sass, including how to adjust, change, and manipulate colors using various methods and parameters.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 19, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 22:45:33", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"description": "Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "favicon": "https://sass-lang.com/icon.png", "language": "en", "title": "Sass: sass:color", "scrapeId": "37f9d22c-83f9-4981-86a1-f2ebfabb3d29", "sourceURL": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/color", "url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/color/", "statusCode": 200}}}

Here are some tips to keep in mind:\n\nFor historical reasons, if `$color` is in a legacy color space, any legacy color space channels can be adjusted.\n\nIt’s an error to specify an RGB channel at the same time as an HSL channel, or either of those at the same time as an HWB channel.\n\nIt’s a good idea to pass `$space` explicitly even for legacy colors.\n\nIf `$color` is in a legacy color space, this sets the HSL saturation to 0%. Otherwise, it sets the Oklch chroma to 0%.\n\nIf `$color` is already in-gamut for `$space`, it’s returned as-is.\n\nStick to these, and you'll avoid a lot of headaches!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/color", "title": "sass:color", "description": "This documentation page covers the built-in color functions available in Sass, including how to adjust, change, and manipulate colors using various methods and parameters.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 19, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 22:45:33", "type": "best_practices", "page_metadata": {"description": "Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "favicon": "https://sass-lang.com/icon.png", "language": "en", "title": "Sass: sass:color", "scrapeId": "37f9d22c-83f9-4981-86a1-f2ebfabb3d29", "sourceURL": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/color", "url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/color/", "statusCode": 200}}}
{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Structure of a Stylesheet is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Structure of a Stylesheet in sass.\n\n# Structure of a Stylesheet\n\nAn overview of the structure and components of Sass stylesheets, including statements, expressions, and operations.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Statements\n\nA Sass stylesheet is made up of a series of statements, which are evaluated in order to build the resulting CSS. Some statements may have blocks, defined using `{` and `}`, which contain other statements. For example, a style rule is a statement with a block. That block contains other statements, such as property declarations.\n\nIn SCSS, statements are separated by semicolons (which are optional if the statement uses a block). In the indented syntax, they’re just separated by newlines.\n\n## Universal Statements\n\nThese types of statements can be used anywhere in a Sass stylesheet:\n\n- Variable declarations, like `$var: value`.\n- Flow control at-rules, like `@if` and `@each`.\n- The `@error`, `@warn`, and `@debug` rules.\n\n## CSS Statements\n\nThese statements produce CSS. They can be used anywhere except within a `@function`:\n\n- Style rules, like `h1 { /* ... */ }`.\n- CSS at-rules, like `@media` and `@font-face`.\n- Mixin uses using `@include`.\n- The `@at-root` rule.\n\n## Top-Level Statements\n\nThese statements can only be used at the top level of a stylesheet, or nested within a CSS statement at the top level:\n\n- Module loads, using `@use`.\n- Imports, using `@import`.\n- Mixin definitions using `@mixin`.\n- Function definitions using `@function`.\n\n## Other Statements\n\n- Property declarations like `width: 100px` may only be used within style rules and some CSS at-rules.\n- The `@extend` rule may only be used within style rules.\n\n## Expressions\n\nAn expression is anything that goes on the right-hand side of a property or variable declaration. Each expression produces a value. Any valid CSS property value is also a Sass expression, but Sass expressions are much more powerful than plain CSS values. They’re passed as arguments to mixins and functions, used for control flow with the `@if` rule, and manipulated using arithmetic. We call Sass’s expression syntax SassScript.\n\n## Literals\n\nThe simplest expressions just represent static values:\n\n- Numbers, which may or may not have units, like `12` or `100px`.\n- Strings, which may or may not have quotes, like `\"Helvetica Neue\"` or `bold`.\n- Colors, which can be referred to by their hex representation or by name, like `#c6538c` or `blue`.\n- The boolean literals `true` or `false`.\n- The singleton `null`.\n- Lists of values, which may be separated by spaces or commas and which may be enclosed in square brackets or no brackets at all, like `1.5em 1em 0 2em`, `Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif`, or `[col1-start]`.\n- Maps that associate values with keys, like `(\"background\": red, \"foreground\": pink)`.\n\n## Operations\n\nSass defines syntax for a number of operations:\n\n- `==` and `!=` are used to check if two values are the same.\n- `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%` have their usual mathematical meaning for numbers, with special behaviors for units that matches the use of units in scientific math.\n- `<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=` check whether two numbers are greater or less than one another.\n- `and`, `or`, and `not` have the usual boolean behavior. Sass considers every value \"true\" except for `false` and `null`.\n- `+`, `-`, and `/` can be used to concatenate strings.\n- `(` and `)` can be used to explicitly control the precedence order of operations.\n\n## Other Expressions\n\n- Variables, like `$var`.\n- Function calls, like `nth($list, 1)` or `var(--main-bg-color)`, which may call Sass core library functions or user-defined functions, or which may be compiled directly to CSS.\n- Special functions, like `calc(1px + 100%)` or `url(http://myapp.com/assets/logo.png)`, that have their own unique parsing rules.\n- The parent selector, `&`.\n- The value `!important`, which is parsed as an unquoted string.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax/structure", "title": "Structure of a Stylesheet", "description": "An overview of the structure and components of Sass stylesheets, including statements, expressions, and operations.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 9, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 22:49:00", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"title": "Sass: Structure of a Stylesheet", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "language": "en", "description": "Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets", "favicon": "https://sass-lang.com/icon.png", "scrapeId": "04188bb5-38db-4831-af1d-ae7b29ce4a65", "sourceURL": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax/structure", "url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax/structure/", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Calculations is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Calculations in sass.\n\n# Calculations\n\nCalculations are how Sass represents the `calc()` function, as well as similar functions like `clamp()`, `min()`, and `max()`. Sass will simplify these as much as possible, even if they’re combined with one another.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Compatibility\n\nDart Sass since 1.40.0\n\nLibSass ✗\n\nRuby Sass ✗\n\nLibSass, Ruby Sass, and versions of Dart Sass prior to 1.40.0 parse `calc()` as a [special function](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax/special-functions#element-progid-and-expression) like `element()`.\n\nLibSass, Ruby Sass, and versions of Dart Sass prior to 1.31.0 parse `clamp()` as a [plain CSS function](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/function/#plain-css-functions) rather than supporting special syntax within it. Versions of Dart Sass between 1.31.0 and 1.40.0 parse `clamp()` as a [special function](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax/special-functions#element-progid-and-expression) like `element()`.\n\n## Compatibility (Adjacent values)\n\nDart Sass since 1.67.0\n\nLibSass ✗\n\nRuby Sass ✗\n\nVersions of Dart Sass between 1.40.0 and 1.67.0 don’t allow multiple values in calculations that aren’t separated by an operator, even in cases like `calc(1 var(--plus-two))` which is valid CSS (since `--plus-two` can be defined to be `+ 2`).\n\nAs of Dart Sass 1.67.0, multiple values in a calculation can be separated by spaces as long as every other value evaluates to an unquoted string (such as a `var()` expression or the unquoted string `\"+ 2\").\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@debug calc(400px + 10%); // calc(400px + 10%)\n@debug calc(400px / 2); // 200px\n@debug min(100px, calc(1rem + 10%)); // min(100px, 1rem + 10%)\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@debug calc(400px + 10%)  // calc(400px + 10%)\n@debug calc(400px / 2)  // 200px\n@debug min(100px, calc(1rem + 10%)) ; // min(100px, 1rem + 10%)\n```\n\n## Simplification\n\nSass will simplify adjacent operations in calculations if they use units that can be combined at compile-time, such as `1in + 10px` or `5s * 2`. If possible, it’ll even simplify the whole calculation to a single number—for example, `clamp(0px, 30px, 20px)` will return `20px`.\n\n## Heads up!\n\nThis means that a calculation expression won’t necessarily always return a calculation! If you’re writing a Sass library, you can always use the [`meta.type-of()`](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/meta#type-of) function to determine what type you’re dealing with.\n\n## Operations\n\nYou can’t use calculations with normal SassScript operations like `+` and `*`. If you want to write some math functions that allow calculations just write them within their own `calc()` expressions—if they’re passed a bunch of numbers with compatible units, they’ll return plain numbers as well, and if they’re passed calculations they’ll return calculations.\n\n## Constants\n\nCalculations can also contain constants, which are written as CSS identifiers. For forwards-compatibility with future CSS specs, _all_ identifiers are allowed, and by default they’re just treated as unquoted strings that are passed-through as-is.\n\n## Calculation Functions\n\nVersions of Dart Sass 1.65.0 and later _except_ 1.66.x handle the execution of these calculation functions: `round()`, `mod()`, `rem()`, `sin()`, `cos()`, `tan()`, `asin()`, `acos()`, `atan()`, `atan2()`, `pow()`, `sqrt()`, `hypot()`, `log()`, `exp()`, `abs()`, and `sign()`.\n\n## Legacy Global Functions\n\nIf a call to `round()`, `abs()`, `min()`, or `max()` is a valid calculation expression, it will be parsed as a calculation. But as soon as any part of the call contains a SassScript feature that isn’t supported in a calculation, like the [modulo operator](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/operators/numeric/), it’s parsed as a call to the appropriate Sass math function instead.\n\n## min() and max()\n\nLibSass, Ruby Sass, and versions of Dart Sass prior to 1.11.0 _always_ parse `min()` and `max()` as Sass functions. To create a plain CSS `min()` or `max()` call for those implementations, you can write something like `unquote(\"min(#{$padding}, env(safe-area-inset-left))\")` instead.\n\n## round()\n\nThe [`round(<strategy>, number, step)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/round#parameter) function accepts an optional rounding strategy, a value to be rounded and a rounding interval `step`. `strategy` should be `nearest`, `up`, `down`, or `to-zero`.\n\n## abs()\n\nThe [`abs(value)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/abs) takes in a single expression as a parameter and returns the absolute value of `$value`. If `$value` is negative, this returns `-$value`, and if `$value` is positive, it returns `$value` as-is.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/calculations", "title": "Calculations", "description": "Calculations are how Sass represents the `calc()` function, as well as similar functions like `clamp()`, `min()`, and `max()`.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: What are some tips for using Calculations in sass effectively?\n\nAssistant: Great question! Here are some tips to keep in mind:\n\nCalculations use a special syntax that’s different from normal SassScript. It’s the same syntax as the CSS `calc()`, but with the additional ability to use Sass variables and call Sass functions.\n\nYou can also use interpolation in a calculation. However, if you do, no operations that involve that interpolation will be simplified or type-checked, so it’s easy to end up with extra verbose or even invalid CSS. Rather than writing `calc(10px + #{$var})`, just write `calc(10px + $var)`!\n\nIf you’re writing a Sass library, you can always use the `meta.type-of()` function to determine what type you’re dealing with.\n\nStick to these, and you'll avoid a lot of headaches!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/calculations", "title": "Calculations", "description": "Calculations are how Sass represents the `calc()` function, as well as similar functions like `clamp()`, `min()`, and `max()`.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what String Operators is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain String Operators in sass.\n\n# String Operators\n\nSass supports a few operators that generate strings.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## String Operators Overview\n\nSass supports a few operators that generate strings:\n\n- `<expression> + <expression>` returns a string that contains both expressions’ values. If the either value is a quoted string, the result will be quoted; otherwise, it will be unquoted.\n\n- `<expression> - <expression>` returns an unquoted string that contains both expressions’ values, separated by `-`. This is a legacy operator, and interpolation should generally be used instead.\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@debug \"Helvetica\" + \" Neue\"; // \"Helvetica Neue\"\n@debug sans- + serif; // sans-serif\n@debug sans - serif; // sans-serif\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@debug \"Helvetica\" + \" Neue\"  // \"Helvetica Neue\"\n@debug sans- + serif  // sans-serif\n@debug sans - serif  // sans-serif\n```\n\n## Usage with Other Values\n\nThese operators don’t just work for strings! They can be used with any values that can be written to CSS, with a few exceptions:\n\n- Numbers can’t be used as the left-hand value, because they have their own operators.\n- Colors can’t be used as the left-hand value, because they used to have their own operators.\n\n## SCSS Syntax with Other Values\n\n```scss\n@debug \"Elapsed time: \" + 10s; // \"Elapsed time: 10s\";\n@debug true + \" is a boolean value\"; // \"true is a boolean value\";\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax with Other Values\n\n```sass\n@debug \"Elapsed time: \" + 10s  // \"Elapsed time: 10s\";\n@debug true + \" is a boolean value\"  // \"true is a boolean value\";\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\nIt’s often cleaner and clearer to use interpolation to create strings, rather than relying on these operators.\n\n## Unary Operators\n\nFor historical reasons, Sass also supports `/` and `-` as unary operators which take only one value:\n\n- `/<expression>` returns an unquoted string starting with `/` and followed by the expression’s value.\n- `-<expression>` returns an unquoted string starting with `-` and followed by the expression’s value.\n\n## SCSS Syntax for Unary Operators\n\n```scss\n@debug / 15px; // /15px\n@debug - moz; // -moz\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax for Unary Operators\n\n```sass\n@debug / 15px  // /15px\n@debug - moz  // -moz\n```\n\n## Current Releases\n\n- [Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass) [1.85.1](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases/tag/1.85.1)\n- [LibSass](https://sass-lang.com/libsass) [3.6.6](https://github.com/sass/libsass/releases/tag/3.6.6)\n- [Ruby Sass](https://sass-lang.com/ruby-sass) ⚰\n- [Implementation Guide](https://sass-lang.com/implementation)\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/operators/string", "title": "String Operators", "description": "Sass supports a few operators that generate strings.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 11, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 22:53:04", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"favicon": "https://sass-lang.com/icon.png", "description": "Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets", "title": "Sass: String Operators", "language": "en", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "scrapeId": "1dcf9759-c39a-442b-8f79-e6cbe207ed2a", "sourceURL": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/operators/string", "url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/operators/string/", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Null Value in Sass is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Null Value in Sass in sass.\n\n# Null Value in Sass\n\nThis page covers the usage and implications of the null value in Sass, including its representation, syntax examples, and how it affects CSS output.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Introduction to Null\n\nThe value `null` is the only value of its type. It represents the absence of a value, and is often returned by functions to indicate the lack of a result.\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@use \"sass:map\";\n@use \"sass:string\";\n\n@debug string.index(\"Helvetica Neue\", \"Roboto\"); // null\n@debug map.get((\"large\": 20px), \"small\"); // null\n@debug &; // null\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@use \"sass:map\"\n@use \"sass:string\"\n\n@debug string.index(\"Helvetica Neue\", \"Roboto\")  // null\n@debug map.get((\"large\": 20px), \"small\")  // null\n@debug &  // null\n```\n\n## Null in Lists\n\nIf a list contains a `null`, that `null` is omitted from the generated CSS.\n\n## SCSS Syntax for Lists\n\n```scss\n$fonts: (\"serif\": \"Helvetica Neue\", \"monospace\": \"Consolas\");\n\nh3 {\n  font: 18px bold map-get($fonts, \"sans\");\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax for Lists\n\n```sass\n$fonts: (\"serif\": \"Helvetica Neue\", \"monospace\": \"Consolas\")\n\nh3\n  font: 18px bold map-get($fonts, \"sans\")\n```\n\n## CSS Output for Lists\n\n```css\nh3 {\n  font: 18px bold;\n}\n```\n\n## Omitting Null Property Values\n\nIf a property value is `null`, that property is omitted entirely.\n\n## SCSS Syntax for Property Values\n\n```scss\n$fonts: (\"serif\": \"Helvetica Neue\", \"monospace\": \"Consolas\");\n\nh3 {\n  font: {\n    size: 18px;\n    weight: bold;\n    family: map-get($fonts, \"sans\");\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax for Property Values\n\n```sass\n$fonts: (\"serif\": \"Helvetica Neue\", \"monospace\": \"Consolas\")\n\nh3\n  font:\n    size: 18px\n    weight: bold\n    family: map-get($fonts, \"sans\")\n```\n\n## CSS Output for Property Values\n\n```css\nh3 {\n  font-size: 18px;\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n```\n\n## Null as Falsey Value\n\n`null` is also falsey, which means it counts as `false` for any rules or operators that take booleans. This makes it easy to use values that can be `null` as conditions for `@if` and `if()`.\n\n## SCSS Syntax for Mixin\n\n```scss\n@mixin app-background($color) {\n  #{if(&, '&.app-background', '.app-background')} {\n    background-color: $color;\n    color: rgba(#fff, 0.75);\n  }\n}\n\n@include app-background(#036);\n\n.sidebar {\n  @include app-background(#c6538c);\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax for Mixin\n\n```sass\n@mixin app-background($color)\n  #{if(&, '&.app-background', '.app-background')}\n    background-color: $color\n    color: rgba(#fff, 0.75)\n\n@include app-background(#036)\n\n.sidebar\n  @include app-background(#c6538c)\n```\n\n## CSS Output for Mixin\n\n```css\n.app-background {\n  background-color: #036;\n  color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.75);\n}\n\n.sidebar.app-background {\n  background-color: #c6538c;\n  color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.75);\n}\n```\n\n## Current Releases\n\n- [Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass) [1.85.1](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases/tag/1.85.1)\n- [LibSass](https://sass-lang.com/libsass) [3.6.6](https://github.com/sass/libsass/releases/tag/3.6.6)\n- [Ruby Sass](https://sass-lang.com/ruby-sass) ⚰\n- [Implementation Guide](https://sass-lang.com/implementation)\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/null", "title": "Null Value in Sass", "description": "This page covers the usage and implications of the null value in Sass, including its representation, syntax examples, and how it affects CSS output.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 16, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 22:53:33", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"language": "en", "favicon": "https://sass-lang.com/icon.png", "description": "Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "title": "Sass: null", "scrapeId": "44052dc3-2bc2-4d03-a69a-5d1bb3eae253", "sourceURL": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/null", "url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/null/", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Colors is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Colors in sass.\n\n# Colors\n\nThis page covers the color spaces supported by Sass, compatibility with different Sass implementations, and various color functions available in Sass.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Compatibility (Color Spaces)\n\nDart Sass since 1.79.0\n\nLibSass ✗\n\nRuby Sass ✗\n\nLibSass, Ruby Sass, and older versions of Dart Sass don’t support color spaces other than `rgb` and `hsl`.\n\nAs well as to adding support for new color spaces, this release changed some details of the way colors were handled. In particular, even the legacy `rgb` and `hsl` color spaces are no longer clamped to their gamuts; it’s now possible to represent `rgb(500 0 0)` or other out-of-bounds values. In addition, `rgb` colors are no longer rounded to the nearest integer because the CSS spec now requires implementations to maintain precision wherever possible.\n\n## Compatibility (Level 4 Syntax)\n\nDart Sass since 1.14.0\n\nLibSass ✗\n\nRuby Sass since 3.6.0\n\nLibSass and older versions of Dart or Ruby Sass don’t support hex colors with an alpha channel.\n\nSass has built-in support for color values. Just like CSS colors, each color represents a point in a particular color space such as `rgb` or `lab`. Sass colors can be written as hex codes ( `#f2ece4` or `#b37399aa`), CSS color names ( `midnightblue`, `transparent`), or color functions like `rgb()`, `lab()`, or `color()`.\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@debug #f2ece4; // #f2ece4\n@debug #b37399aa; // rgba(179, 115, 153, 67%)\n@debug midnightblue; // #191970\n@debug rgb(204 102 153); // #c69\n@debug lab(32.4% 38.4 -47.7 / 0.7); // lab(32.4% 38.4 -47.7 / 0.7)\n@debug color(display-p3 0.597 0.732 0.576); // color(display-p3 0.597 0.732 0.576)\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@debug #f2ece4  // #f2ece4\n@debug #b37399aa  // rgba(179, 115, 153, 67%)\n@debug midnightblue  // #191970\n@debug rgb(204 102 153)  // #c69\n@debug lab(32.4% 38.4 -47.7)  // lab(32.4% 38.4 -47.7)\n@debug color(display-p3 0.597 0.732 0.576)  // color(display-p3 0.597 0.732 0.576)\n```\n\n## Color Spaces\n\nSass supports the same set of color spaces as CSS. A Sass color will always be emitted in the same color space it was written in unless it’s in a legacy color space or you convert it to another space using `color.to-space()`. All the other color functions in Sass will always return a color in the same spaces as the original color, even if the function made changes to that color in another space.\n\nAlthough each color space has bounds on the gamut it expects for its channels, Sass can represent out-of-gamut values for any color space. This allows a color from a wide-gamut space to be safely converted into and back out of a narrow-gamut space without losing information.\n\n## Heads up!\n\nCSS requires that some color functions clip their input channels. For example, `rgb(500 0 0)` clips its red channel to be within [0, 255] and so is equivalent to `rgb(255 0 0)` even though `rgb(500 0 0)` is a distinct value that Sass can represent. You can always use Sass’s `color.change()` function to set an out-of-gamut value for any space.\n\n## Full List of Color Spaces\n\n| Space | Syntax | Channels [min, max] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `rgb`* | `rgb(102 51 153)`<br>`#663399`<br>`rebeccapurple` | red [0, 255];<br> green [0, 255];<br> blue [0, 255] |\n| `hsl`* | `hsl(270 50% 40%)` | hue [0, 360];<br> saturation [0%, 100%];<br> lightness [0%, 100%] |\n| `hwb`* | `hwb(270 20% 40%)` | hue [0, 360];<br> whiteness [0%, 100%];<br> blackness [0%, 100%] |\n| `srgb` | `color(srgb 0.4 0.2 0.6)` | red [0, 1];<br> green [0, 1];<br> blue [0, 1] |\n| `srgb-linear` | `color(srgb-linear 0.133 0.033 0.319)` | red [0, 1];<br> green [0, 1];<br> blue [0, 1] |\n| `display-p3` | `color(display-p3 0.374 0.21 0.579)` | red [0, 1];<br> green [0, 1];<br> blue [0, 1] |\n| `a98-rgb` | `color(a98-rgb 0.358 0.212 0.584)` | red [0, 1];<br> green [0, 1];<br> blue [0, 1] |\n| `prophoto-rgb` | `color(prophoto-rgb 0.316 0.191 0.495)` | red [0, 1];<br> green [0, 1];<br> blue [0, 1] |\n| `rec2020` | `color(rec2020 0.305 0.168 0.531)` | red [0, 1];<br> green [0, 1];<br> blue [0, 1] |\n| `xyz`, `xyz-d65` | `color(xyz 0.124 0.075 0.309)`<br>`color(xyz-d65 0.124 0.075 0.309)` | x [0, 1];<br> y [0, 1];<br> z [0, 1] |\n| `xyz-d50` | `color(xyz-d50 0.116 0.073 0.233)` | x [0, 1];<br> y [0, 1];<br> z [0, 1] |\n| `lab` | `lab(32.4% 38.4 -47.7)` | lightness [0%, 100%];<br> a [-125, 125];<br> b [-125, 125] |\n| `lch` | `lch(32.4% 61.2 308.9deg)` | lightness [0%, 100%];<br> chroma [0, 150];<br> hue [0deg, 360deg] |\n| `oklab` | `oklab(44% 0.088 -0.134)` | lightness [0%, 100%];<br> a [-0.4, 0.4];<br> b [-0.4, 0.4] |\n| `oklch` | `oklch(44% 0.16 303.4deg)` | lightness [0%, 100%];<br> chroma [0, 0.4];<br> hue [0deg, 360deg] |\n\n## Missing Channels\n\nColors in CSS and Sass can have \"missing channels\", which are written `none` and represent a channel whose value isn’t known or doesn’t affect the way the color is rendered. For example, you might write `hsl(none 0% 50%)`, because the hue doesn’t matter if the saturation is `0%`. In most cases, missing channels are just treated as 0 values, but they do come up occasionally:\n\n- If you’re mixing colors together, either as part of CSS interpolation for something like an animation or using Sass’s `color.mix()` function, missing channels always take on the other color’s value for that channel if possible.\n\n- If you convert a color with a missing channel to another space that has an analogous channel, that channel will be set to `none` after the conversion is complete.\n\nAlthough `color.channel()` will return 0 for missing channels, you can always check for them using `color.is-missing()`.\n\n## Powerless Channels\n\nA color channel is considered \"powerless\" under certain circumstances its value doesn’t affect the way the color is rendered on screen. The CSS spec requires that when a color is converted to a new space, any powerless channels are replaced by `none`. Sass does this in all cases except conversions to legacy spaces, to guarantee that converting to a legacy space always produces a color that’s compatible with older browsers.\n\n## Legacy Color Spaces\n\nHistorically, CSS and Sass only supported the standard RGB gamut, and only supported the `rgb`, `hsl`, and `hwb` functions for defining colors. Because at the time all colors used the same gamut, every color function worked with every color regardless of its color space. Sass still preserves this behavior, but only for older functions and only for colors in these three \"legacy\" color spaces. Even so, it’s still a good practice to explicitly specify the `$space` you want to work in when using color functions.\n\n## Color Functions\n\nSass supports many useful color functions that can be used to create new colors based on existing ones by mixing colors together or scaling their channel values. When calling color functions, color spaces should always be written as unquoted strings to match CSS, while channel names should be written as quoted strings so that channels like \"red\" aren’t parsed as color values.\n\n## Fun fact\n\nSass color functions can automatically convert colors between spaces, which makes it easy to do transformations in perceptually-uniform color spaces like Oklch. But they’ll always return a color in the same space you gave it, unless you explicitly call `color.to-space()` to convert it.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/colors", "title": "Colors", "description": "This page covers the color spaces supported by Sass, compatibility with different Sass implementations, and various color functions available in Sass.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 12, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 22:54:08", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"description": "Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "favicon": "https://sass-lang.com/icon.png", "title": "Sass: Colors", "language": "en", "scrapeId": "49749bf3-2cb5-4950-ad44-0f01259967c8", "sourceURL": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/colors", "url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/colors/", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: How do I color spaces in sass?\n\nAssistant: To color spaces in sass, here's what you do:\nSass supports the same set of color spaces as CSS. A Sass color will always be emitted in the same color space it was written in unless it’s in a legacy color space or you convert it to another space using `color.to-space()`. All the other color functions in Sass will always return a color in the same spaces as the original color, even if the function made changes to that color in another space.\n\nAlthough each color space has bounds on the gamut it expects for its channels, Sass can represent out-of-gamut values for any color space. This allows a color from a wide-gamut space to be safely converted into and back out of a narrow-gamut space without losing information..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/colors", "title": "Colors", "description": "This page covers the color spaces supported by Sass, compatibility with different Sass implementations, and various color functions available in Sass.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 12, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 22:54:08", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"description": "Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "favicon": "https://sass-lang.com/icon.png", "title": "Sass: Colors", "language": "en", "scrapeId": "49749bf3-2cb5-4950-ad44-0f01259967c8", "sourceURL": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/colors", "url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/colors/", "statusCode": 200}}}
{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: How do I heads up! in sass?\n\nAssistant: To heads up! in sass, here's what you do:\nCSS requires that some color functions clip their input channels. For example, `rgb(500 0 0)` clips its red channel to be within [0, 255] and so is equivalent to `rgb(255 0 0)` even though `rgb(500 0 0)` is a distinct value that Sass can represent.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: How do I missing channels in sass?\n\nAssistant: To missing channels in sass, here's what you do:\nColors in CSS and Sass can have \"missing channels\", which are written `none` and represent a channel whose value isn’t known or doesn’t affect the way the color is rendered. For example, you might write `hsl(none 0% 50%)`, because the hue doesn’t matter if the saturation is `0%`. In most cases, missing channels are just treated as 0 values, but they do come up occasionally:\n\n- If you’re mixing colors together, either as part of CSS interpolation for something like an animation or using Sass’s `color.mix()` function, missing channels always take on the other color’s value for that channel if possible.\n\n- If you convert a color with a missing channel to another space that has an analogous channel, that channel will be set to `none` after the conversion is complete.\n\nAlthough `color.channel()` will return 0 for missing channels, you can always check for them using `color.is-missing()`..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/colors", "title": "Colors", "description": "This page covers the color spaces supported by Sass, compatibility with different Sass implementations, and various color functions available in Sass.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 12, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 22:54:08", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"description": "Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "favicon": "https://sass-lang.com/icon.png", "title": "Sass: Colors", "language": "en", "scrapeId": "49749bf3-2cb5-4950-ad44-0f01259967c8", "sourceURL": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/colors", "url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/colors/", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: How do I legacy color spaces in sass?\n\nAssistant: To legacy color spaces in sass, here's what you do:\nHistorically, CSS and Sass only supported the standard RGB gamut, and only supported the `rgb`, `hsl`, and `hwb` functions for defining colors. Because at the time all colors used the same gamut, every color function worked with every color regardless of its color space. Sass still preserves this behavior, but only for older functions and only for colors in these three \"legacy\" color spaces. Even so, it’s still a good practice to explicitly specify the `$space` you want to work in when using color functions..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/colors", "title": "Colors", "description": "This page covers the color spaces supported by Sass, compatibility with different Sass implementations, and various color functions available in Sass.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 12, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 22:54:08", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"description": "Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "favicon": "https://sass-lang.com/icon.png", "title": "Sass: Colors", "language": "en", "scrapeId": "49749bf3-2cb5-4950-ad44-0f01259967c8", "sourceURL": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/colors", "url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/colors/", "statusCode": 200}}}

As such, it’s safest to encode all Sass stylesheets as UTF-8.\n\nIt’s often the case that a document is initially available only as a sequence of bytes, which must be decoded into Unicode. Sass performs this decoding as follows:\n\n- If the sequence of bytes begins with the UTF-8 or UTF-16 encoding of U+FEFF BYTE ORDER MARK, the corresponding encoding is used.\n- If the sequence of bytes begins with the plain ASCII string `@charset`, Sass determines the encoding using step 2 of the CSS algorithm for determining the fallback encoding.\n- Otherwise, UTF-8 is used.\n\n## Parse Errors\n\nWhen Sass encounters invalid syntax in a stylesheet, parsing will fail and an error will be presented to the user with information about the location of the invalid syntax and the reason it was invalid.\n\nNote that this is different than CSS, which specifies how to recover from most errors rather than failing immediately. This is one of the few cases where SCSS isn’t _strictly_ a superset of CSS. However, it’s much more useful to Sass users to see errors immediately, rather than having them passed through to the CSS output.\n\nThe location of parse errors can be accessed through implementation-specific APIs.

The values `false` and `null` are _falsey_, which means Sass considers them to indicate falsehood and cause conditions to fail. Every other value is considered _truthy_, so Sass considers them to work like `true` and cause conditions to succeed.\n\nFor example, if you want to check if a string contains a space, you can just write `string.index($string, \" \")`. The `string.index()` function returns `null` if the string isn’t found and a number otherwise.\n\n### ⚠️ Heads up!\n\nSome languages consider more values falsey than just `false` and `null`.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what @extend is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain @extend in sass.\n\n# @extend\n\nThis documentation page covers the use of the @extend rule in Sass, which allows one class to inherit the styles of another class, helping to reduce cluttered HTML and avoid errors.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n.error {\n  border: 1px #f00;\n  background-color: #fdd;\n\n  &--serious {\n    @extend .error;\n    border-width: 3px;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n.error\n  border: 1px #f00\n  background-color: #fdd\n\n  &--serious\n    @extend .error\n    border-width: 3px\n```\n\n## CSS Output\n\n```css\n.error, .error--serious {\n  border: 1px #f00;\n  background-color: #fdd;\n}\n.error--serious {\n  border-width: 3px;\n}\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\nUnlike mixins, which copy styles into the current style rule, @extend updates style rules that contain the extended selector so that they contain the extending selector as well. When extending selectors, Sass does intelligent unification.\n\n## Heads up!\n\nExtends are resolved after the rest of your stylesheet is compiled. This means that if you @extend .error, it won’t affect the inner selector in .error { &__icon { ... } }.\n\n## Placeholder Selectors\n\nSometimes you want to write a style rule that’s only intended to be extended. In that case, you can use placeholder selectors, which look like class selectors that start with % instead of ..\n\n## Private Placeholders\n\nA placeholder selector can be marked private by starting its name with either - or _. A private placeholder selector can only be extended within the stylesheet that defines it.\n\n## Extension Scope\n\nWhen one stylesheet extends a selector, that extension will only affect style rules written in upstream modules.\n\n## Mandatory and Optional Extends\n\nNormally, if an @extend doesn’t match any selectors in the stylesheet, Sass will produce an error. This helps protect from typos or from renaming a selector without renaming the selectors that inherit from it.\n\n## Extends or Mixins?\n\nAs a rule of thumb, extends are the best option when you’re expressing a relationship between semantic classes. For non-semantic collections of styles, writing a mixin can avoid cascade headaches.\n\n## Limitations\n\nOnly simple selectors—individual selectors like .info or a—can be extended. If .message.info could be extended, the definition of @extend says that elements matching the extender would be styled as though they matched .message.info.\n\n## HTML Heuristics\n\nWhen @extend interleaves complex selectors, it doesn’t generate all possible combinations of ancestor selectors.\n\n## Extend in @media\n\nWhile @extend is allowed within @media and other CSS at-rules, it’s not allowed to extend selectors that appear outside its at-rule.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/extend", "title": "@extend", "description": "This documentation page covers the use of the @extend rule in Sass, which allows one class to inherit the styles of another class, helping to reduce cluttered HTML and avoid errors.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 13, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 22:59:49", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"language": "en", "title": "Sass: @extend", "favicon": "https://sass-lang.com/icon.png", "description": "Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "scrapeId": "03eb7ca9-c6c4-46b0-840c-aca5fbc63da0", "sourceURL": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/extend", "url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/extend/", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Functions in Sass is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Functions in Sass in sass.\n\n# Functions in Sass\n\nFunctions allow you to define complex operations on SassScript values that you can re-use throughout your stylesheet. They make it easy to abstract out common formulas and behaviors in a readable way.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@function fibonacci($n) {\n  $sequence: 0 1;\n  @for $_ from 1 through $n {\n    $new: nth($sequence, length($sequence)) + nth($sequence, length($sequence) - 1);\n    $sequence: append($sequence, $new);\n  }\n  @return nth($sequence, length($sequence));\n}\n\n.sidebar {\n  float: left;\n  margin-left: fibonacci(4) * 1px;\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@function fibonacci($n)\n  $sequence: 0 1\n  @for $_ from 1 through $n\n    $new: nth($sequence, length($sequence)) + nth($sequence, length($sequence) - 1)\n    $sequence: append($sequence, $new)\n  @return nth($sequence, length($sequence))\n\n.sidebar\n  float: left\n  margin-left: fibonacci(4) * 1px\n```\n\n## CSS Output\n\n```css\n.sidebar {\n  float: left;\n  margin-left: 5px;\n}\n```\n\n## Fun fact\n\nFunction names, like all Sass identifiers, treat hyphens and underscores as identical. This means that `scale-color` and `scale_color` both refer to the same function. This is a historical holdover from the very early days of Sass, when it only allowed underscores in identifier names. Once Sass added support for hyphens to match CSS’s syntax, the two were made equivalent to make migration easier.\n\n## Heads up\n\nWhile it’s technically possible for functions to have side-effects like setting global variables, this is strongly discouraged. Use mixins for side-effects, and use functions just to compute values.\n\n## Arguments\n\nArguments allow functions’ behavior to be customized each time they’re called. The arguments are specified in the `@function` rule after the function’s name, as a list of variable names surrounded by parentheses. The function must be called with the same number of arguments in the form of SassScript expressions. The values of these expression are available within the function’s body as the corresponding variables.\n\n## Optional Arguments\n\nNormally, every argument a function declares must be passed when that function is included. However, you can make an argument optional by defining a default value which will be used if that arguments isn’t passed. Default values use the same syntax as variable declarations: the variable name, followed by a colon and a SassScript expression. This makes it easy to define flexible function APIs that can be used in simple or complex ways.\n\n## SCSS Syntax for Optional Arguments\n\n```scss\n@function invert($color, $amount: 100%) {\n  $inverse: change-color($color, $hue: hue($color) + 180);\n  @return mix($inverse, $color, $amount);\n}\n\n$primary-color: #036;\n.header {\n  background-color: invert($primary-color, 80%);\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax for Optional Arguments\n\n```sass\n@function invert($color, $amount: 100%)\n  $inverse: change-color($color, $hue: hue($color) + 180)\n  @return mix($inverse, $color, $amount)\n\n$primary-color: #036\n.header\n  background-color: invert($primary-color, 80%)\n```\n\n## CSS Output for Optional Arguments\n\n```css\n.header {\n  background-color: rgb(81.6, 51, 20.4);\n}\n```\n\n## Fun fact for Optional Arguments\n\nDefault values can be any SassScript expression, and they can even refer to earlier arguments!\n\n## Keyword Arguments\n\nWhen a function is called, arguments can be passed by name in addition to passing them by their position in the argument list. This is especially useful for functions with multiple optional arguments, or with boolean arguments whose meanings aren’t obvious without a name to go with them.\n\n## SCSS Syntax for Keyword Arguments\n\n```scss\n$primary-color: #036;\n.banner {\n  background-color: $primary-color;\n  color: scale-color($primary-color, $lightness: +40%);\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax for Keyword Arguments\n\n```sass\n$primary-color: #036\n.banner\n  background-color: $primary-color\n  color: scale-color($primary-color, $lightness: +40%)\n```\n\n## CSS Output for Keyword Arguments\n\n```css\n.banner {\n  background-color: #036;\n  color: rgb(10.2, 132.6, 255);\n}\n```\n\n## Heads up for Keyword Arguments\n\nBecause any argument can be passed by name, be careful when renaming a function’s arguments… it might break your users! It can be helpful to keep the old name around as an optional argument for a while and printing a warning if anyone passes it, so they know to migrate to the new argument.\n\n## Taking Arbitrary Arguments\n\nSometimes it’s useful for a function to be able to take any number of arguments. If the last argument in a @function declaration ends in ..., then all extra arguments to that function are passed to that argument as a list. This argument is known as an argument list.\n\n## SCSS Syntax for Taking Arbitrary Arguments\n\n```scss\n@function sum($numbers...) {\n  $sum: 0;\n  @each $number in $numbers {\n    $sum: $sum + $number;\n  }\n  @return $sum;\n}\n\n.micro {\n  width: sum(50px, 30px, 100px);\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax for Taking Arbitrary Arguments\n\n```sass\n@function sum($numbers...)\n  $sum: 0\n  @each $number in $numbers\n    $sum: $sum + $number\n\n  @return $sum\n\n.micro\n  width: sum(50px, 30px, 100px)\n```\n\n## CSS Output for Taking Arbitrary Arguments\n\n```css\n.micro {\n  width: 180px;\n}\n```\n\n## Taking Arbitrary Keyword Arguments\n\nArgument lists can also be used to take arbitrary keyword arguments. The meta.keywords() function takes an argument list and returns any extra keywords that were passed to the function as a map from argument names (not including $) to those arguments’ values.\n\n## Passing Arbitrary Arguments\n\nJust like argument lists allow functions to take arbitrary positional or keyword arguments, the same syntax can be used to pass positional and keyword arguments to a function. If you pass a list followed by ... as the last argument of a function call, its elements will be treated as additional positional arguments. Similarly, a map followed by ... will be treated as additional keyword arguments. You can even pass both at once!\n\n## SCSS Syntax for Passing Arbitrary Arguments\n\n```scss\n$widths: 50px, 30px, 100px;\n.micro {\n  width: min($widths...);\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax for Passing Arbitrary Arguments\n\n```sass\n$widths: 50px, 30px, 100px\n.micro\n  width: min($widths...)\n```\n\n## CSS Output for Passing Arbitrary Arguments\n\n```css\n.micro {\n  width: 30px;\n}\n```\n\n## Fun fact for Passing Arbitrary Arguments\n\nBecause an argument list keeps track of both positional and keyword arguments, you use it to pass both at once to another function. That makes it super easy to define an alias for a function!\n\n## SCSS Syntax for Deprecated Function\n\n```scss\n@function fg($args...) {\n  @warn \"The fg() function is deprecated. Call foreground() instead.\";\n  @return foreground($args...);\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax for Deprecated Function\n\n```sass\n@function fg($args...)\n  @warn \"The fg() function is deprecated. Call foreground() instead.\"\n  @return foreground($args...)\n```\n\n## @return\n\nThe @return at-rule indicates the value to use as the result of calling a function. It’s only allowed within a @function body, and each @function must end with a @return. When a @return is encountered, it immediately ends the function and returns its result. Returning early can be useful for handling edge-cases or cases where a more efficient algorithm is available without wrapping the entire function in an @else block.\n\n## SCSS Syntax for @return\n\n```scss\n@use \"sass:string\";\n\n@function str-insert($string, $insert, $index) {\n  // Avoid making new strings if we don't need to.\n  @if string.length($string) == 0 {\n    @return $insert;\n  }\n\n  $before: string.slice($string, 0, $index);\n  $after: string.slice($string, $index);\n  @return $before + $insert + $after;\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax for @return\n\n```sass\n@use \"sass:string\"\n\n@function str-insert($string, $insert, $index)\n  // Avoid making new strings if we don't need to.\n  @if string.length($string) == 0\n    @return $insert\n\n  $before: string.slice($string, 0, $index)\n  $after: string.slice($string, $index)\n  @return $before + $insert + $after\n```\n\n## Other Functions\n\nIn addition to user-defined function, Sass provides a substantial core library of built-in functions that are always available to use. Sass implementations also make it possible to define custom functions in the host language. And of course, you can always call plain CSS functions.\n\n## Plain CSS Functions\n\nAny function call that’s not either a user-defined or built-in function is compiled to a plain CSS function (unless it uses Sass argument syntax). The arguments will be compiled to CSS and included as-is in the function call. This ensures that Sass supports all CSS functions without needing to release new versions every time a new one is added.\n\n## SCSS Syntax for Plain CSS Functions\n\n```scss\n@debug var(--main-bg-color); // var(--main-bg-color)\n\n$primary: #f2ece4;\n$accent: #e1d7d2;\n@debug radial-gradient($primary, $accent); // radial-gradient(#f2ece4, #e1d7d2)\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax for Plain CSS Functions\n\n```sass\n@debug var(--main-bg-color)  // var(--main-bg-color)\n\n$primary: #f2ece4\n$accent: #e1d7d2\n@debug radial-gradient($primary, $accent)  // radial-gradient(#f2ece4, #e1d7d2)\n```\n\n## Heads up for Plain CSS Functions\n\nBecause any unknown function will be compiled to CSS, it’s easy to miss when you typo a function name. Consider running a CSS linter on your stylesheet’s output to be notified when this happens!\n\n## Fun fact for Plain CSS Functions\n\nSome CSS functions, like calc() and element() have unusual syntax. Sass parses these functions specially as unquoted strings.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/function", "title": "Functions in Sass", "description": "Functions allow you to define complex operations on SassScript values that you can re-use throughout your stylesheet.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what CSS At-Rules is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain CSS At-Rules in sass.\n\n# CSS At-Rules\n\nThis documentation covers the usage and syntax of CSS at-rules in Sass, including compatibility, examples in SCSS and Sass syntax, and the resulting CSS output.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Compatibility (Name Interpolation)\n\nDart Sass since 1.15.0\n\nLibSass ✗\n\nRuby Sass ✗\n\nLibSass, Ruby Sass, and older versions of Dart Sass don’t support interpolation in at-rule names. They do support interpolation in values.\n\nSass supports all the at-rules that are part of CSS proper. To stay flexible and forwards-compatible with future versions of CSS, Sass has general support that covers almost all at-rules by default. A CSS at-rule is written `@<name> <value>`, `@<name> { ... }`, or `@<name> <value> { ... }`. The name must be an identifier, and the value (if one exists) can be pretty much anything. Both the name and the value can contain interpolation.\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@namespace svg url(http://www.w3.org/2000/svg);\n\n@font-face {\n  font-family: \"Open Sans\";\n  src: url(\"/fonts/OpenSans-Regular-webfont.woff2\") format(\"woff2\");\n}\n\n@counter-style thumbs {\n  system: cyclic;\n  symbols: \"\\1F44D\";\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@namespace svg url(http://www.w3.org/2000/svg)\n\n@font-face\n  font-family: \"Open Sans\"\n  src: url(\"/fonts/OpenSans-Regular-webfont.woff2\") format(\"woff2\")\n\n@counter-style thumbs\n  system: cyclic\n  symbols: \"\\1F44D\"\n```\n\n## CSS Output\n\n```css\n@charset \"UTF-8\";\n@namespace svg url(http://www.w3.org/2000/svg);\n@font-face {\n  font-family: \"Open Sans\";\n  src: url(\"/fonts/OpenSans-Regular-webfont.woff2\") format(\"woff2\");\n}\n@counter-style thumbs {\n  system: cyclic;\n  symbols: \"👍\";\n}\n```\n\n## Nested At-Rules\n\nIf a CSS at-rule is nested within a style rule, the two automatically swap positions so that the at-rule is at the top level of the CSS output and the style rule is within it. This makes it easy to add conditional styling without having to rewrite the style rule’s selector.\n\n## SCSS Syntax (Nested At-Rules)\n\n```scss\n.print-only {\n  display: none;\n\n  @media print { display: block; }\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax (Nested At-Rules)\n\n```sass\n.print-only\n  display: none\n\n  @media print\n    display: block\n```\n\n## CSS Output (Nested At-Rules)\n\n```css\n.print-only {\n  display: none;\n}\n@media print {\n  .print-only {\n    display: block;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## @media\n\nCompatibility (Range Syntax):\n\nDart Sass since 1.11.0\n\nLibSass ✗\n\nRuby Sass since 3.7.0\n\nLibSass and older versions of Dart Sass and Ruby Sass don’t support media queries with features written in a range context.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Property Declarations is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Property Declarations in sass.\n\n# Property Declarations\n\nIn Sass as in CSS, property declarations define how elements that match a selector are styled. But Sass adds extra features to make them easier to write and to automate.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n.circle {\n  $size: 100px;\n  width: $size;\n  height: $size;\n  border-radius: $size * 0.5;\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n.circle\n  $size: 100px\n  width: $size\n  height: $size\n  border-radius: $size * 0.5\n```\n\n## CSS Output\n\n```css\n.circle {\n  width: 100px;\n  height: 100px;\n  border-radius: 50px;\n}\n```\n\n## Interpolation\n\nA property’s name can include [interpolation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/interpolation), which makes it possible to dynamically generate properties as needed. You can even interpolate the entire property name!\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@mixin prefix($property, $value, $prefixes) {\n  @each $prefix in $prefixes {\n    -#{$prefix}-#{$property}: $value;\n  }\n  #{$property}: $value;\n}\n\n.gray {\n  @include prefix(filter, grayscale(50%), moz webkit);\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@mixin prefix($property, $value, $prefixes)\n  @each $prefix in $prefixes\n    -#{$prefix}-#{$property}: $value\n\n  #{$property}: $value\n\n.gray\n  @include prefix(filter, grayscale(50%), moz webkit)\n```\n\n## CSS Output\n\n```css\n.gray {\n  -moz-filter: grayscale(50%);\n  -webkit-filter: grayscale(50%);\n  filter: grayscale(50%);\n}\n```\n\n## Nesting\n\nMany CSS properties start with the same prefix that acts as a kind of namespace. For example, `font-family`, `font-size`, and `font-weight` all start with `font-`. Sass makes this easier and less redundant by allowing property declarations to be nested. The outer property names are added to the inner, separated by a hyphen.\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n.enlarge {\n  font-size: 14px;\n  transition: {\n    property: font-size;\n    duration: 4s;\n    delay: 2s;\n  }\n\n  &:hover { font-size: 36px; }\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n.enlarge\n  font-size: 14px\n  transition:\n    property: font-size\n    duration: 4s\n    delay: 2s\n\n  &:hover\n    font-size: 36px\n```\n\n## CSS Output\n\n```css\n.enlarge {\n  font-size: 14px;\n  transition-property: font-size;\n  transition-duration: 4s;\n  transition-delay: 2s;\n}\n.enlarge:hover {\n  font-size: 36px;\n}\n```\n\n## Hidden Declarations\n\nSometimes you only want a property declaration to show up some of the time. If a declaration’s value is [`null`](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/null) or an empty [unquoted string](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/strings#unquoted), Sass won’t compile that declaration to CSS at all.\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n$rounded-corners: false;\n\n.button {\n  border: 1px solid black;\n  border-radius: if($rounded-corners, 5px, null);\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n$rounded-corners: false\n\n.button\n  border: 1px solid black\n  border-radius: if($rounded-corners, 5px, null)\n```\n\n## CSS Output\n\n```css\n.button {\n  border: 1px solid black;\n}\n```\n\n## Custom Properties\n\n[CSS custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*), also known as CSS variables, have an unusual declaration syntax: they allow almost any text at all in their declaration values. What’s more, those values are accessible to JavaScript, so any value might potentially be relevant to the user.\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n$primary: #81899b;\n$accent: #302e24;\n$warn: #dfa612;\n\n:root {\n  --primary: #{$primary};\n  --accent: #{$accent};\n  --warn: #{$warn};\n\n  // Even though this looks like a Sass variable, it's valid CSS so it's not\n  // evaluated.\n  --consumed-by-js: $primary;\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n$primary: #81899b\n$accent: #302e24\n$warn: #dfa612\n\n:root\n  --primary: #{$primary}\n  --accent: #{$accent}\n  --warn: #{$warn}\n\n  // Even though this looks like a Sass variable, it's valid CSS so it's not\n  // evaluated.\n  --consumed-by-js: $primary\n```\n\n## CSS Output\n\n```css\n:root {\n  --primary: #81899b;\n  --accent: #302e24;\n  --warn: #dfa612;\n  --consumed-by-js: $primary;\n}\n```\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/style-rules/declarations", "title": "Property Declarations", "description": "In Sass as in CSS, property declarations define how elements that match a selector are styled.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what @forward is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain @forward in sass.\n\n# @forward\n\nThe `@forward` rule loads a Sass stylesheet and makes its mixins, functions, and variables available when your stylesheet is loaded with the `@use` rule. It makes it possible to organize Sass libraries across many files, while allowing their users to load a single entrypoint file.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe `@forward` rule loads a Sass stylesheet and makes its [mixins](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/mixin), [functions](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/function), and [variables](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/variables) available when your stylesheet is loaded with the [`@use` rule](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use). It makes it possible to organize Sass libraries across many files, while allowing their users to load a single entrypoint file.\n\n## Usage\n\nThe rule is written `@forward \"<url>\"`. It loads the module at the given URL just like `@use`, but it makes the [public](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use#private-members) members of the loaded module available to users of your module as though they were defined directly in your module. Those members aren’t available in your module, though—if you want that, you’ll need to write a `@use` rule as well. Don’t worry, it’ll only load the module once!\n\n## Best Practices\n\nIf you _do_ write both a `@forward` and a `@use` for the same module in the same file, it’s always a good idea to write the `@forward` first. That way, if your users want to [configure the forwarded module](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use#configuration), that configuration will be applied to the `@forward` before your `@use` loads it without any configuration.\n\n## Fun Fact\n\nThe `@forward` rule acts just like `@use` when it comes to a module’s CSS. Styles from a forwarded module will be included in the compiled CSS output, and the module with the `@forward` can [extend](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/extend) it, even if it isn’t also `@use` d.\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n// src/_list.scss\n@mixin list-reset {\n  margin: 0;\n  padding: 0;\n  list-style: none;\n}\n\n```\n\n```scss\n// bootstrap.scss\n@forward \"src/list\";\n\n```\n\n```scss\n// styles.scss\n@use \"bootstrap\";\n\nli {\n  @include bootstrap.list-reset;\n}\n\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n// src/_list.sass\n@mixin list-reset\n  margin: 0\n  padding: 0\n  list-style: none\n\n```\n\n```sass\n// bootstrap.sass\n@forward \"src/list\"\n\n```\n\n```sass\n// styles.sass\n@use \"bootstrap\"\n\nli\n  @include bootstrap.list-reset\n\n```\n\n## CSS Output\n\n```css\nli {\n  margin: 0;\n  padding: 0;\n  list-style: none;\n}\n\n```\n\n## Adding a Prefix\n\nBecause module members are usually used with [a namespace](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use#loading-members), short and simple names are usually the most readable option. But those names might not make sense outside the module they’re defined in, so `@forward` has the option of adding an extra prefix to all the members it forwards.\n\n## SCSS Syntax for Adding a Prefix\n\n```scss\n// src/_list.scss\n@mixin reset {\n  margin: 0;\n  padding: 0;\n  list-style: none;\n}\n\n```\n\n```scss\n// bootstrap.scss\n@forward \"src/list\" as list-*;\n\n```\n\n```scss\n// styles.scss\n@use \"bootstrap\";\n\nli {\n  @include bootstrap.list-reset;\n}\n\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax for Adding a Prefix\n\n```sass\n// src/_list.sass\n@mixin reset\n  margin: 0\n  padding: 0\n  list-style: none\n\n```\n\n```sass\n// bootstrap.sass\n@forward \"src/list\" as list-*\n\n```\n\n```sass\n// styles.sass\n@use \"bootstrap\"\n\nli\n  @include bootstrap.list-reset\n\n```\n\n## CSS Output for Adding a Prefix\n\n```css\nli {\n  margin: 0;\n  padding: 0;\n  list-style: none;\n}\n\n```\n\n## Controlling Visibility\n\nSometimes, you don’t want to forward _every_ member from a module. You may want to keep some members private so that only your package can use them, or you may want to require your users to load some members a different way. You can control exactly which members get forwarded by writing `@forward \"<url>\" hide <members...>` or `@forward \"<url>\" show <members...>`.\n\n## SCSS Syntax for Controlling Visibility\n\n```scss\n// src/_list.scss\n$horizontal-list-gap: 2em;\n\n@mixin list-reset {\n  margin: 0;\n  padding: 0;\n  list-style: none;\n}\n\n@mixin list-horizontal {\n  @include list-reset;\n\n  li {\n    display: inline-block;\n    margin: {\n      left: -2px;\n      right: $horizontal-list-gap;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n```\n\n```scss\n// bootstrap.scss\n@forward \"src/list\" hide list-reset, $horizontal-list-gap;\n\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax for Controlling Visibility\n\n```sass\n// src/_list.sass\n$horizontal-list-gap: 2em\n\n@mixin list-reset\n  margin: 0\n  padding: 0\n  list-style: none\n\n@mixin list-horizontal\n  @include list-rest\n\n  li\n    display: inline-block\n    margin:\n      left: -2px\n      right: $horizontal-list-gap\n\n```\n\n```sass\n// bootstrap.sass\n@forward \"src/list\" hide list-reset, $horizontal-list-gap\n\n```\n\n## Configuring Modules\n\nThe `@forward` rule can also load a module with [configuration](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use#configuration). This mostly works the same as it does for `@use`, with one addition: a `@forward` rule’s configuration can use the `!default` flag in its configuration.\n\n## SCSS Syntax for Configuring Modules\n\n```scss\n// _library.scss\n$black: #000 !default;\n$border-radius: 0.25rem !default;\n$box-shadow: 0 0.5rem 1rem rgba($black, 0.15) !default;\n\ncode {\n  border-radius: $border-radius;\n  box-shadow: $box-shadow;\n}\n\n```\n\n```scss\n// _opinionated.scss\n@forward 'library' with (\n  $black: #222 !default,\n  $border-radius: 0.1rem !default\n);\n\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax for Configuring Modules\n\n```sass\n// _library.sass\n$black: #000 !default\n$border-radius: 0.25rem !default\n$box-shadow: 0 0.5rem 1rem rgba($black, 0.15) !default\n\ncode\n  border-radius: $border-radius\n  box-shadow: $box-shadow\n\n```\n\n```sass\n// _opinionated.sass\n@forward 'library' with ($black: #222 !default, $border-radius: 0.1rem !default)\n\n```\n\n## CSS Output for Configuring Modules\n\n```css\ncode {\n  border-radius: 0.1rem;\n  box-shadow: 0 0.5rem 1rem rgba(51, 51, 51, 0.15);\n}\n\n```\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/forward", "title": "@forward", "description": "The `@forward` rule loads a Sass stylesheet and makes its mixins, functions, and variables available when your stylesheet is loaded with the `@use` rule.

Here are some tips to keep in mind:\n\nIf you _do_ write both a `@forward` and a `@use` for the same module in the same file, it’s always a good idea to write the `@forward` first. That way, if your users want to configure the forwarded module, that configuration will be applied to the `@forward` before your `@use` loads it without any configuration.\n\nStick to these, and you'll avoid a lot of headaches!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/forward", "title": "@forward", "description": "The `@forward` rule loads a Sass stylesheet and makes its mixins, functions, and variables available when your stylesheet is loaded with the `@use` rule.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Special Functions is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Special Functions in sass.\n\n# Special Functions\n\nCSS defines many functions, and most of them work just fine with Sass’s normal function syntax. They’re parsed as function calls, resolved to plain CSS functions, and compiled as-is to CSS. There are a few exceptions, though, which have special syntax that can’t just be parsed as a SassScript expression. All special function calls return unquoted strings.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## `url()`\n\nThe `url()` function is commonly used in CSS, but its syntax is different than other functions: it can take either a quoted _or_ unquoted URL. Because an unquoted URL isn’t a valid SassScript expression, Sass needs special logic to parse it.\n\nIf the `url()`’s argument is a valid unquoted URL, Sass parses it as-is, although interpolation may also be used to inject SassScript values. If it’s not a valid unquoted URL—for example, if it contains variables or function calls—it’s parsed as a normal plain CSS function call.\n\n- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax/special-functions/#example-url-scss)\n- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax/special-functions/#example-url-sass)\n- [CSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax/special-functions/#example-url-css) \n\n### SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n$roboto-font-path: \"../fonts/roboto\";\n\n@font-face {\n    // This is parsed as a normal function call that takes a quoted string.\n    src: url(\"#{$roboto-font-path}/Roboto-Thin.woff2\") format(\"woff2\");\n\n    font-family: \"Roboto\";\n    font-weight: 100;\n}\n\n@font-face {\n    // This is parsed as a normal function call that takes an arithmetic\n    // expression.\n    src: url($roboto-font-path + \"/Roboto-Light.woff2\") format(\"woff2\");\n\n    font-family: \"Roboto\";\n    font-weight: 300;\n}\n\n@font-face {\n    // This is parsed as an interpolated special function.\n    src: url(#{$roboto-font-path}/Roboto-Regular.woff2) format(\"woff2\");\n\n    font-family: \"Roboto\";\n    font-weight: 400;\n}\n```\n\n### Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n$roboto-font-path: \"../fonts/roboto\"\n\n@font-face\n    // This is parsed as a normal function call that takes a quoted string.\n    src: url(\"#{$roboto-font-path}/Roboto-Thin.woff2\") format(\"woff2\")\n\n    font-family: \"Roboto\"\n    font-weight: 100\n\n@font-face\n    // This is parsed as a normal function call that takes an arithmetic\n    // expression.\n    src: url($roboto-font-path + \"/Roboto-Light.woff2\") format(\"woff2\")\n\n    font-family: \"Roboto\"\n    font-weight: 300\n\n@font-face\n    // This is parsed as an interpolated special function.\n    src: url(#{$roboto-font-path}/Roboto-Regular.woff2) format(\"woff2\")\n\n    font-family: \"Roboto\"\n    font-weight: 400\n```\n\n### CSS Output\n\n```css\n@font-face {\n  src: url(\"../fonts/roboto/Roboto-Thin.woff2\") format(\"woff2\");\n  font-family: \"Roboto\";\n  font-weight: 100;\n}\n@font-face {\n  src: url(\"../fonts/roboto/Roboto-Light.woff2\") format(\"woff2\");\n  font-family: \"Roboto\";\n  font-weight: 300;\n}\n@font-face {\n  src: url(../fonts/roboto/Roboto-Regular.woff2) format(\"woff2\");\n  font-family: \"Roboto\";\n  font-weight: 400;\n}\n```\n\n## `element()`, `progid:...()`, and `expression()`\n\nCompatibility (calc()):\n\nDart Sass since <1.40.0\n\nLibSass ✗\n\nRuby Sass ✗\n\nLibSass, Ruby Sass, and versions of Dart Sass prior to 1.40.0 parse `calc()` as special syntactic function like `element()`.\n\nDart Sass versions 1.40.0 and later parse `calc()` as a calculation.\n\nCompatibility (clamp()):\n\nDart Sass since >=1.31.0 <1.40.0\n\nLibSass ✗\n\nRuby Sass ✗\n\nLibSass, Ruby Sass, and versions of Dart Sass prior to 1.31.0 parse `clamp()` as a plain CSS function rather than supporting special syntax with init.\n\nDart Sass versions between 1.31.0 and 1.40.0 parse `clamp()` as special syntactic function like `element()`.\n\nDart Sass versions 1.40.0 and later parse `clamp()` as a calculation.\n\nThe `element()` function is defined in the CSS spec, and because its IDs could be parsed as colors, they need special parsing.\n\n`expression()` and functions beginning with `progid:` are legacy Internet Explorer features that use non-standard syntax.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what @use is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain @use in sass.\n\n# @use\n\nThe @use rule loads mixins, functions, and variables from other Sass stylesheets, and combines CSS from multiple stylesheets together. Stylesheets loaded by @use are called 'modules'.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Compatibility\n\nDart Sass since 1.23.0\nLibSass ✗\nRuby Sass ✗\n\nOnly Dart Sass currently supports `@use`. Users of other implementations must use the [`@import` rule](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/import) instead.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe `@use` rule loads [mixins](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/mixin), [functions](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/function), and [variables](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/variables) from other Sass stylesheets, and combines CSS from multiple stylesheets together. Stylesheets loaded by `@use` are called \"modules\". Sass also provides [built-in modules](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules) full of useful functions.\n\n## Heads up!\n\nA stylesheet’s `@use` rules must come before any rules other than `@forward`, including [style rules](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/style-rules). However, you can declare variables before `@use` rules to use when [configuring modules](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use/#configuration).\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n// foundation/_code.scss\ncode {\n  padding: .25em;\n  line-height: 0;\n}\n\n// foundation/_lists.scss\nul, ol {\n  text-align: left;\n\n  & & {\n    padding: {\n      bottom: 0;\n      left: 0;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// style.scss\n@use 'foundation/code';\n@use 'foundation/lists';\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n// foundation/_code.sass\ncode\n  padding: .25em\n  line-height: 0\n\n// foundation/_lists.sass\nul, ol\n  text-align: left\n\n  & &\n    padding:\n      bottom: 0\n      left: 0\n\n// style.sass\n@use 'foundation/code'\n@use 'foundation/lists'\n```\n\n## CSS Output\n\n```css\ncode {\n  padding: .25em;\n  line-height: 0;\n}\n\nul, ol {\n  text-align: left;\n}\nul ul, ol ol {\n  padding-bottom: 0;\n  padding-left: 0;\n}\n```\n\n## Loading Members\n\nYou can access variables, functions, and mixins from another module by writing `<namespace>.<variable>`, `<namespace>.<function>()`, or `@include <namespace>.<mixin>()`. By default, the namespace is just the last component of the module’s URL.\n\n## Fun fact:\n\nBecause `@use` adds namespaces to member names, it’s safe to choose very simple names like `$radius` or `$width` when writing a stylesheet. This is different from the old [`@import` rule](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/import), which encouraged that users write long names like `$mat-corner-radius` to avoid conflicts with other libraries, and it helps keep your stylesheets clear and easy to read!\n\n## SCSS Syntax for Loading Members\n\n```scss\n// src/_corners.scss\n$radius: 3px;\n\n@mixin rounded {\n  border-radius: $radius;\n}\n\n// style.scss\n@use \"src/corners\";\n\n.button {\n  @include corners.rounded;\n  padding: 5px + corners.$radius;\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax for Loading Members\n\n```sass\n// src/_corners.sass\n$radius: 3px\n\n@mixin rounded\n  border-radius: $radius\n\n// style.sass\n@use \"src/corners\"\n\n.button\n  @include corners.rounded\n  padding: 5px + corners.$radius\n```\n\n## CSS Output for Loading Members\n\n```css\n.button {\n  border-radius: 3px;\n  padding: 8px;\n}\n```\n\n## Choosing a Namespace\n\nBy default, a module’s namespace is just the last component of its URL without a file extension. However, sometimes you might want to choose a different namespace—you might want to use a shorter name for a module you refer to a lot, or you might be loading multiple modules with the same filename.\n\n## SCSS Syntax for Choosing a Namespace\n\n```scss\n// src/_corners.scss\n$radius: 3px;\n\n@mixin rounded {\n  border-radius: $radius;\n}\n\n// style.scss\n@use \"src/corners\" as c;\n\n.button {\n  @include c.rounded;\n  padding: 5px + c.$radius;\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax for Choosing a Namespace\n\n```sass\n// src/_corners.sass\n$radius: 3px\n\n@mixin rounded\n  border-radius: $radius\n\n// style.sass\n@use \"src/corners\" as c\n\n.button\n  @include c.rounded\n  padding: 5px + c.$radius\n```\n\n## CSS Output for Choosing a Namespace\n\n```css\n.button {\n  border-radius: 3px;\n  padding: 8px;\n}\n```\n\n## Loading a Module Without a Namespace\n\nYou can even load a module _without_ a namespace by writing `@use \"<url>\" as *`. We recommend you only do this for stylesheets written by you, though; otherwise, they may introduce new members that cause name conflicts!\n\n## SCSS Syntax for Loading Without Namespace\n\n```scss\n// src/_corners.scss\n$radius: 3px;\n\n@mixin rounded {\n  border-radius: $radius;\n}\n\n// style.scss\n@use \"src/corners\" as *;\n\n.button {\n  @include rounded;\n  padding: 5px + $radius;\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax for Loading Without Namespace\n\n```sass\n// src/_corners.sass\n$radius: 3px\n\n@mixin rounded\n  border-radius: $radius\n\n// style.sass\n@use \"src/corners\" as *\n\n.button\n  @include rounded\n  padding: 5px + $radius\n```\n\n## CSS Output for Loading Without Namespace\n\n```css\n.button {\n  border-radius: 3px;\n  padding: 8px;\n}\n```\n\n## Private Members\n\nAs a stylesheet author, you may not want all the members you define to be available outside your stylesheet. Sass makes it easy to define a private member by starting its name with either `-` or `_`. These members will work just like normal within the stylesheet that defines them, but they won’t be part of a module’s public API.\n\n## Fun fact about Private Members\n\nIf you want to make a member private to an entire _package_ rather than just a single module, just don’t [forward its module](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/forward) from any of your package’s entry points.\n\n## SCSS Syntax for Private Members\n\n```scss\n// src/_corners.scss\n$-radius: 3px;\n\n@mixin rounded {\n  border-radius: $-radius;\n}\n\n// style.scss\n@use \"src/corners\";\n\n.button {\n  @include corners.rounded;\n  // This is an error! $-radius isn't visible outside of `_corners.scss`.\n  padding: 5px + corners.$-radius;\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax for Private Members\n\n```sass\n// src/_corners.sass\n$-radius: 3px\n\n@mixin rounded\n  border-radius: $-radius\n\n// style.sass\n@use \"src/corners\"\n\n.button\n  @include corners.rounded\n  // This is an error! $-radius isn't visible outside of `_corners.scss`.\n  padding: 5px + corners.$-radius\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nA stylesheet can define variables with the [`!default` flag](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/variables#default-values) to make them configurable. To load a module with configuration, write `@use <url> with (<variable>: <value>, <variable>: <value>)`. The configured values will override the variables’ default values.\n\n## SCSS Syntax for Configuration\n\n```scss\n// _library.scss\n$black: #000 !default;\n$border-radius: 0.25rem !default;\n$box-shadow: 0 0.5rem 1rem rgba($black, 0.15) !default;\n\ncode {\n  border-radius: $border-radius;\n  box-shadow: $box-shadow;\n}\n\n// style.scss\n@use 'library' with (\n  $black: #222,\n  $border-radius: 0.1rem\n);\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax for Configuration\n\n```sass\n// _library.sass\n$black: #000 !default\n$border-radius: 0.25rem !default\n$box-shadow: 0 0.5rem 1rem rgba($black, 0.15) !default\n\ncode\n  border-radius: $border-radius\n  box-shadow: $box-shadow\n\n// style.sass\n@use 'library' with ($black: #222, $border-radius: 0.1rem)\n```\n\n## CSS Output for Configuration\n\n```css\ncode {\n  border-radius: 0.1rem;\n  box-shadow: 0 0.5rem 1rem rgba(34, 34, 34, 0.15);\n}\n```\n\n## With Mixins\n\nConfiguring modules with `@use ... with` can be very handy, especially when using libraries that were originally written to work with the [`@import` rule](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/import). But it’s not particularly flexible, and we don’t recommend it for more advanced use-cases.\n\n## SCSS Syntax for With Mixins\n\n```scss\n// _library.scss\n$-black: #000;\n$-border-radius: 0.25rem;\n$-box-shadow: null;\n\n@mixin configure($black: null, $border-radius: null, $box-shadow: null) {\n  @if $black {\n    $-black: $black !global;\n  }\n  @if $border-radius {\n    $-border-radius: $border-radius !global;\n  }\n  @if $box-shadow {\n    $-box-shadow: $box-shadow !global;\n  }\n}\n\n@mixin styles {\n  code {\n    border-radius: $-border-radius;\n    box-shadow: -box-shadow();\n  }\n}\n\n// style.scss\n@use 'library';\n\n@include library.configure(\n  $black: #222,\n  $border-radius: 0.1rem\n);\n\n@include library.styles;\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax for With Mixins\n\n```sass\n// _library.sass\n$-black: #000\n$-border-radius: 0.25rem\n$-box-shadow: null\n\n@mixin configure($black: null, $border-radius: null, $box-shadow: null)\n  @if $black\n    $-black: $black !global\n  @if $border-radius\n    $-border-radius: $border-radius !global\n  @if $box-shadow\n    $-box-shadow: $box-shadow !global\n\n@mixin styles\n  code\n    border-radius: $-border-radius\n    box-shadow: -box-shadow()\n\n// style.sass\n@use 'library'\n@include library.configure($black: #222, $border-radius: 0.1rem)\n@include library.styles\n```\n\n## CSS Output for With Mixins\n\n```css\ncode {\n  border-radius: 0.1rem;\n  box-shadow: 0 0.5rem 1rem rgba(34, 34, 34, 0.15);\n}\n```\n\n## Reassigning Variables\n\nAfter loading a module, you can reassign its variables.\n\n## SCSS Syntax for Reassigning Variables\n\n```scss\n// _library.scss\n$color: red;\n\n// _override.scss\n@use 'library';\nlibrary.$color: blue;\n\n// style.scss\n@use 'library';\n@use 'override';\n@debug library.$color;  //=> blue\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax for Reassigning Variables\n\n```sass\n// _library.sass\n$color: red\n\n// _override.sass\n@use 'library'\nlibrary.$color: blue\n\n// style.sass\n@use 'library'\n@use 'override'\n@debug library.$color  //=> blue\n```\n\n## Finding the Module\n\nIt wouldn’t be any fun to write out absolute URLs for every stylesheet you load, so Sass’s algorithm for finding a module makes it a little easier.\n\n## Load Paths\n\nAll Sass implementations allow users to provide _load paths_: paths on the filesystem that Sass will look in when locating modules.\n\n## Partials\n\nAs a convention, Sass files that are only meant to be loaded as modules, not compiled on their own, begin with `_` (as in `_code.scss`). These are called _partials_.\n\n## Index Files\n\nIf you write an `_index.scss` or `_index.sass` in a folder, the index file will be loaded automatically when you load the URL for the folder itself.\n\n## pkg: URLs\n\nSass uses the `pkg:` URL scheme to load stylesheets distributed by various package managers.\n\n## Rules for a pkg: Importer\n\nThere are a few common rules that Sass expects all `pkg:` importers to follow.\n\n## Node.js Package Importer\n\nBecause Sass is most widely-used alongside the Node.js ecosystem, it comes with a `pkg:` importer that uses the same algorithm as Node.js to load Sass stylesheets.\n\n## Loading CSS\n\nIn addition to loading `.sass` and `.scss` files, Sass can load plain old `.css` files.\n\n## Differences From @import\n\nThe `@use` rule is intended to replace the old [`@import` rule](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/import), but it’s intentionally designed to work differently.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use", "title": "@use", "description": "The @use rule loads mixins, functions, and variables from other Sass stylesheets, and combines CSS from multiple stylesheets together.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Sass @import Documentation is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Sass @import Documentation in sass.\n\n# Sass @import Documentation\n\nThis page covers the usage of the @import rule in Sass, its syntax, issues, migration to @use, and best practices.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Overview\n\nSass extends CSS’s `@import` rule with the ability to import Sass and CSS stylesheets, providing access to mixins, functions, and variables and combining multiple stylesheets’ CSS together. Unlike plain CSS imports, which require the browser to make multiple HTTP requests as it renders your page, Sass imports are handled entirely during compilation.\n\n## Heads up!\n\nAs of Dart Sass 1.80.0, the `@import` rule is deprecated and will be removed from the language in Dart Sass 3.0.0. Prefer the `@use` rule instead.\n\n## What’s Wrong With `@import`?\n\nThe `@import` rule has a number of serious issues:\n\n- `@import` makes all variables, mixins, and functions globally accessible. This makes it very difficult for people (or tools) to tell where anything is defined.\n- Because everything’s global, libraries must add a prefix to all their members to avoid naming collisions.\n- `@extend` rules are also global, which makes it difficult to predict which style rules will be extended.\n- Each stylesheet is executed and its CSS emitted every time it’s `@import`ed, which increases compilation time and produces bloated output.\n- There was no way to define private members or placeholder selectors that were inaccessible to downstream stylesheets.\n\n## How Do I Migrate?\n\nWe’ve written a migration tool that automatically converts most `@import`-based code to `@use`-based code in a flash. Just point it at your entry points and let it run!\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n// foundation/_code.scss\ncode {\n  padding: .25em;\n  line-height: 0;\n}\n\n// foundation/_lists.scss\nul, ol {\n  text-align: left;\n\n  & & {\n    padding: {\n      bottom: 0;\n      left: 0;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// style.scss\n@import 'foundation/code', 'foundation/lists';\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n// foundation/_code.sass\ncode\n  padding: .25em\n  line-height: 0\n\n// foundation/_lists.sass\nul, ol\n  text-align: left\n\n  & &\n    padding:\n      bottom: 0\n      left: 0\n\n// style.sass\n@import foundation/code, foundation/lists\n```\n\n## CSS Output\n\n```css\ncode {\n  padding: .25em;\n  line-height: 0;\n}\nul, ol {\n  text-align: left;\n}\nul ul, ol ol {\n  padding-bottom: 0;\n  padding-left: 0;\n}\n```\n\n## Finding the File\n\nIt wouldn’t be any fun to write out absolute URLs for every stylesheet you import, so Sass’s algorithm for finding a file to import makes it a little easier. For starters, you don’t have to explicitly write out the extension of the file you want to import; `@import \"variables\"` will automatically load `variables.scss`, `variables.sass`, or `variables.css`.\n\n## Load Paths\n\nAll Sass implementations allow users to provide load paths: paths on the filesystem that Sass will look in when resolving imports. For example, if you pass `node_modules/susy/sass` as a load path, you can use `@import \"susy\"` to load `node_modules/susy/sass/susy.scss`.\n\n## Partials\n\nAs a convention, Sass files that are only meant to be imported, not compiled on their own, begin with `_` (as in `_code.scss`). These are called partials, and they tell Sass tools not to try to compile those files on their own. You can leave off the `_` when importing a partial.\n\n## Index Files\n\nIf you write an `_index.scss` or `_index.sass` in a folder, when the folder itself is imported that file will be loaded in its place.\n\n## Custom Importers\n\nAll Sass implementations provide a way to define custom importers, which control how `@import` s locate stylesheets.\n\n## Nesting\n\nImports are usually written at the top level of a stylesheet, but they don’t have to be. They can be nested within style rules or plain CSS at-rules as well.\n\n## Importing CSS\n\nIn addition to importing `.sass` and `.scss` files, Sass can import plain old `.css` files. The only rule is that the import must not explicitly include the `.css` extension.\n\n## Plain CSS `@import`s\n\nBy default, LibSass handles plain CSS imports correctly. However, any custom importers will incorrectly apply to plain-CSS `@import` rules.\n\n## Interpolation\n\nAlthough Sass imports can’t use interpolation, plain CSS imports can.\n\n## Import and Modules\n\nOnly Dart Sass currently supports `@use`. Users of other implementations must use the `@import` rule instead.\n\n## Importing a Module-System File\n\nWhen you import a file that contains `@use` rules, the importing file has access to all members defined directly in that file.\n\n## Import-Only Files\n\nIf you name a file `<name>.import.scss`, it will only be loaded for imports, not for `@use` s.\n\n## Configuring Modules Through Imports\n\nYou can configure modules that are loaded through an `@import` by defining global variables prior to the `@import` that first loads that module.\n\n## Loading a Module That Contains Imports\n\nWhen you use `@use` (or `@forward`) to load a module that uses `@import`, that module will contain all the public members defined by the stylesheet you load.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/import", "title": "Sass @import Documentation", "description": "This page covers the usage of the @import rule in Sass, its syntax, issues, migration to @use, and best practices.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 21, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 23:14:04", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"title": "Sass: @import", "language": "en", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "favicon": "https://sass-lang.com/icon.png", "description": "Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets", "scrapeId": "68ce39a2-5e9d-462f-81fd-3d631f1163cd", "sourceURL": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/import", "url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/import/", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: How do I load paths in sass?\n\nAssistant: To load paths in sass, here's what you do:\nAll Sass implementations allow users to provide load paths: paths on the filesystem that Sass will look in when resolving imports.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Ruby Sass Command-Line Interface is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Ruby Sass Command-Line Interface in sass.\n\n# Ruby Sass Command-Line Interface\n\nThis documentation covers the usage, options, and commands for the Ruby Sass command-line interface, including modes of operation and various flags.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Usage\n\nThe Ruby Sass executable can be invoked in one of two modes.\n\n## One-to-One Mode\n\nOne-to-one mode compiles a single input file ( `input.scss`) to a single output location ( `output.css`). If no output location is passed, the compiled CSS is printed to the terminal. If no input _or_ output is passed, the CSS is read from standard input and printed to the terminal.\n\nThe input file is parsed as SCSS if its extension is `.scss` or as the indented syntax if its extension is `.sass`. If it doesn’t have one of these two extensions, or if it comes from standard input, it’s parsed as the indented syntax by default. This can be controlled with the `--scss` flag.\n\n## Many-to-Many Mode\n\nMany-to-many mode compiles one or more input files to one or more output files. The inputs are separated from the outputs with colons. It can also compile all Sass files in a directory to CSS files with the same names in another directory. Many-to-many mode is enabled when any argument contains a colon, _or_ when the `--update` flag or the `--watch` flag is passed.\n\nIf an input file is passed without a corresponding output file, it’s compiled to a CSS file named after the input file, but with the extension replaced with `.css`. If an input directory is passed without a corresponding output directory, all the Sass files within it are compiled to CSS files in the same directory.\n\nWhen compiling whole directories, Sass will ignore partial files whose names begin with `_`. You can use partials to separate out your stylesheets without creating a bunch of unnecessary output files.\n\nMany-to-many mode will only compile stylesheets whose dependencies have been modified more recently than the corresponding CSS file was generated. It will also print status messages when updating stylesheets.\n\n## Options\n\nThese options affect the behavior of the Ruby Sass command-line interface.\n\n## Common\n\nCommon options for Ruby Sass.\n\n## --load-path\n\nThis option (abbreviated `-I`) adds an additional load path for Sass to look for stylesheets. It can be passed multiple times to provide multiple load paths. Earlier load paths will take precedence over later ones.\n\n## --require\n\nThis option (abbreviated `-r`) loads a Ruby gem before running Sass. It can be used to load functions defined in Ruby into your Sass environment.\n\n## --compass\n\nThis flag loads the Compass framework and makes its mixins and functions available for use in Sass.\n\n## --style\n\nThis option (abbreviated `-t`) controls the output style of the resulting CSS. Ruby Sass supports four output styles:\n- `nested` (the default) indents CSS rules to match the nesting of the Sass source.\n- `expanded` writes each selector and declaration on its own line.\n- `compact` puts each CSS rule on its own single line.\n- `compressed` removes as many extra characters as possible, and writes the entire stylesheet on a single line.\n\n## --help\n\nThis flag (abbreviated `-h` and `-?`) prints a summary of this documentation.\n\n## --version\n\nThis flag prints the current version of Sass.\n\n## Watching and Updating\n\nThese options affect many-to-many mode.\n\n## --watch\n\nEnables many-to-many mode, and causes Sass to stay open and continue compiling stylesheets whenever they or their dependencies change.\n\n## --poll\n\nThis flag, which may only be passed along with `--watch`, tells Sass to manually check for changes to the source files every so often instead of relying on the operating system to notify it when something changes.\n\n## --update\n\nThis flag enables many-to-many mode, even if none of the arguments are colon-separated pairs.\n\n## --force\n\nThis flag (abbreviated `-f`) may only be passed in many-to-many mode. It causes Sass files to always be compiled to CSS files, instead of only being compiled when the source files are more up-to-date than the output.\n\n## --stop-on-error\n\nThis flag may only be passed in many-to-many mode. It tells Sass to stop compiling immediately when an error is detected, rather than trying to compile other Sass files that may not contain errors.\n\n## Input and Output\n\nThese options control how Sass loads its input files and how it produces output files.\n\n## --scss\n\nThis flag tells Sass to parse standard input as SCSS.\n\n## --sourcemap\n\nThis option controls how Sass generates source maps, which are files that tell browsers or other tools that consume CSS how that CSS corresponds to the Sass files from which it was generated.\n\n## --stdin\n\nThis flag (abbreviated `-s`) tells Sass to read its input file from standard input. When it’s passed, no input file may be passed.\n\n## --default-encoding\n\nThis option (abbreviated `-E`) controls the default character encoding that Sass will use to load source files that don’t explicitly specify a character encoding.\n\n## --unix-newlines\n\nThis flag tells Sass to generate output files with whose lines are separated with the U+000A LINEFEED character.\n\n## --debug-info\n\nThis flag (abbreviated `-g`) causes Sass to emit dummy `@media` queries that indicate where each style rule was defined in the source stylesheet.\n\n## --line-comments\n\nThis flag (also available as `--line-numbers`, abbreviated as `-l`) causes Sass to emit comments for every style rule that indicate where each style rule was defined in the source stylesheet.\n\n## Other Options\n\nOther options available for Ruby Sass.\n\n## --interactive\n\nThis flag (abbreviated `-i`) tells Sass to run in interactive mode, where you can write SassScript expressions and see their results.\n\n## --check\n\nThis flag (abbreviated `-c`) tells Sass to verify that the syntax of its input file is valid without executing that file.\n\n## --precision\n\nThis option tells Sass how many digits of precision to use when emitting decimal numbers.\n\n## --cache-location\n\nThis option tells Sass where to store its cache of parsed files, so it can run faster in future invocations.\n\n## --no-cache\n\nThis flag (abbreviated `-C`) tells Sass not to cache parsed files at all.\n\n## --trace\n\nThis flag tells Sass to print the full Ruby stack trace when an error is encountered.\n\n## --quiet\n\nThis flag (abbreviated `-q`) tells Sass not to emit any warnings when compiling.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/ruby-sass", "title": "Ruby Sass Command-Line Interface", "description": "This documentation covers the usage, options, and commands for the Ruby Sass command-line interface, including modes of operation and various flags.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 33, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 23:15:02", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"favicon": "https://sass-lang.com/icon.png", "language": "en", "description": "Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "title": "Sass: Ruby Sass Command-Line Interface", "scrapeId": "ba781652-b3df-464c-bc70-758cb1d1266e", "sourceURL": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/ruby-sass", "url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/ruby-sass/", "statusCode": 200}}}

If no output location is passed, the compiled CSS is printed to the terminal. If no input _or_ output is passed, the CSS is read from standard input and printed to the terminal.\n\nThe input file is parsed as SCSS if its extension is `.scss` or as the indented syntax if its extension is `.sass`.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: How do I many-to-many mode in sass?\n\nAssistant: To many-to-many mode in sass, here's what you do:\nMany-to-many mode compiles one or more input files to one or more output files. The inputs are separated from the outputs with colons. It can also compile all Sass files in a directory to CSS files with the same names in another directory. Many-to-many mode is enabled when any argument contains a colon, _or_ when the `--update` flag or the `--watch` flag is passed.\n\nIf an input file is passed without a corresponding output file, it’s compiled to a CSS file named after the input file, but with the extension replaced with `.css`. If an input directory is passed without a corresponding output directory, all the Sass files within it are compiled to CSS files in the same directory.\n\nWhen compiling whole directories, Sass will ignore partial files whose names begin with `_`. You can use partials to separate out your stylesheets without creating a bunch of unnecessary output files.\n\nMany-to-many mode will only compile stylesheets whose dependencies have been modified more recently than the corresponding CSS file was generated. It will also print status messages when updating stylesheets..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/ruby-sass", "title": "Ruby Sass Command-Line Interface", "description": "This documentation covers the usage, options, and commands for the Ruby Sass command-line interface, including modes of operation and various flags.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 33, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 23:15:02", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"favicon": "https://sass-lang.com/icon.png", "language": "en", "description": "Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "title": "Sass: Ruby Sass Command-Line Interface", "scrapeId": "ba781652-b3df-464c-bc70-758cb1d1266e", "sourceURL": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/ruby-sass", "url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/ruby-sass/", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what @mixin and @include is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain @mixin and @include in sass.\n\n# @mixin and @include\n\nMixins allow you to define styles that can be re-used throughout your stylesheet. They make it easy to avoid using non-semantic classes like `.float-left`, and to distribute collections of styles in libraries.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@mixin reset-list {\n  margin: 0;\n  padding: 0;\n  list-style: none;\n}\n\n@mixin horizontal-list {\n  @include reset-list;\n\n  li {\n    display: inline-block;\n    margin: {\n      left: -2px;\n      right: 2em;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nnav ul {\n  @include horizontal-list;\n}\n```\n\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@mixin reset-list\n  margin: 0\n  padding: 0\n  list-style: none\n\n@mixin horizontal-list\n  @include reset-list\n\n  li\n    display: inline-block\n    margin:\n      left: -2px\n      right: 2em\n\nnav ul\n  @include horizontal-list\n```\n\n\n## CSS Output\n\n```css\nnav ul {\n  margin: 0;\n  padding: 0;\n  list-style: none;\n}\nnav ul li {\n  display: inline-block;\n  margin-left: -2px;\n  margin-right: 2em;\n}\n```\n\n\n## Arguments\n\nMixins can also take arguments, which allows their behavior to be customized each time they’re called. The arguments are specified in the `@mixin` rule after the mixin’s name, as a list of variable names surrounded by parentheses. The mixin must then be included with the same number of arguments in the form of [SassScript expressions](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax/structure#expressions). The values of these expression are available within the mixin’s body as the corresponding variables.\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@mixin rtl($property, $ltr-value, $rtl-value) {\n  #{$property}: $ltr-value;\n\n  [dir=rtl] & {\n    #{$property}: $rtl-value;\n  }\n}\n\n.sidebar {\n  @include rtl(float, left, right);\n}\n```\n\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@mixin rtl($property, $ltr-value, $rtl-value)\n  #{$property}: $ltr-value\n\n  [dir=rtl] &\n    #{$property}: $rtl-value\n\n.sidebar\n  @include rtl(float, left, right)\n```\n\n\n## CSS Output\n\n```css\n.sidebar {\n  float: left;\n}\n[dir=rtl] .sidebar {\n  float: right;\n}\n```\n\n\n## Optional Arguments\n\nNormally, every argument a mixin declares must be passed when that mixin is included. However, you can make an argument optional by defining a _default_ value which will be used if that argument isn’t passed.\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@mixin replace-text($image, $x: 50%, $y: 50%) {\n  text-indent: -99999em;\n  overflow: hidden;\n  text-align: left;\n\n  background: {\n    image: $image;\n    repeat: no-repeat;\n    position: $x $y;\n  }\n}\n\n.mail-icon {\n  @include replace-text(url(\"/images/mail.svg\"), 0);\n}\n```\n\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@mixin replace-text($image, $x: 50%, $y: 50%)\n  text-indent: -99999em\n  overflow: hidden\n  text-align: left\n\n  background:\n    image: $image\n    repeat: no-repeat\n    position: $x $y\n\n.mail-icon\n  @include replace-text(url(\"/images/mail.svg\"), 0)\n```\n\n\n## CSS Output\n\n```css\n.mail-icon {\n  text-indent: -99999em;\n  overflow: hidden;\n  text-align: left;\n  background-image: url(\"/images/mail.svg\");\n  background-repeat: no-repeat;\n  background-position: 0 50%;\n}\n```\n\n\n## Keyword Arguments\n\nWhen a mixin is included, arguments can be passed by name in addition to passing them by their position in the argument list.\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@mixin square($size, $radius: 0) {\n  width: $size;\n  height: $size;\n\n  @if $radius != 0 {\n    border-radius: $radius;\n  }\n}\n\n.avatar {\n  @include square(100px, $radius: 4px);\n}\n```\n\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@mixin square($size, $radius: 0)\n  width: $size\n  height: $size\n\n  @if $radius != 0\n    border-radius: $radius\n\n.avatar\n  @include square(100px, $radius: 4px)\n```\n\n\n## CSS Output\n\n```css\n.avatar {\n  width: 100px;\n  height: 100px;\n  border-radius: 4px;\n}\n```\n\n\n## Taking Arbitrary Arguments\n\nSometimes it’s useful for a mixin to be able to take any number of arguments. If the last argument in a `@mixin` declaration ends in `...`, then all extra arguments to that mixin are passed to that argument as a list.\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@mixin order($height, $selectors...) {\n  @for $i from 0 to length($selectors) {\n    #{nth($selectors, $i + 1)} {\n      position: absolute;\n      height: $height;\n      margin-top: $i * $height;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n@include order(150px, \"input.name\", \"input.address\", \"input.zip\");\n```\n\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@mixin order($height, $selectors...)\n  @for $i from 0 to length($selectors)\n    #{nth($selectors, $i + 1)}\n      position: absolute\n      height: $height\n      margin-top: $i * $height\n\n@include order(150px, \"input.name\", \"input.address\", \"input.zip\")\n```\n\n\n## CSS Output\n\n```css\ninput.name {\n  position: absolute;\n  height: 150px;\n  margin-top: 0px;\n}\n\ninput.address {\n  position: absolute;\n  height: 150px;\n  margin-top: 150px;\n}\n\ninput.zip {\n  position: absolute;\n  height: 150px;\n  margin-top: 300px;\n}\n```\n\n\n## Content Blocks\n\nIn addition to taking arguments, a mixin can take an entire block of styles, known as a _content block_. A mixin can declare that it takes a content block by including the `@content` at-rule in its body.\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@mixin hover {\n  &:not([disabled]):hover {\n    @content;\n  }\n}\n\n.button {\n  border: 1px solid black;\n  @include hover {\n    border-width: 2px;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@mixin hover\n  &:not([disabled]):hover\n    @content\n\n.button\n  border: 1px solid black\n  @include hover\n    border-width: 2px\n```\n\n\n## CSS Output\n\n```css\n.button {\n  border: 1px solid black;\n}\n.button:not([disabled]):hover {\n  border-width: 2px;\n}\n```\n\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/mixin", "title": "@mixin and @include", "description": "Mixins allow you to define styles that can be re-used throughout your stylesheet.

Here are some tips to keep in mind:\n\nMixin names, like all Sass identifiers, treat hyphens and underscores as identical.\n\nArgument lists can also have trailing commas! This makes it easier to avoid syntax errors when refactoring your stylesheets.\n\nBecause any argument can be passed by name, be careful when renaming a mixin’s arguments… it might break your users!\n\nA content block is lexically scoped, which means it can only see local variables in the scope where the mixin is included.\n\nStick to these, and you'll avoid a lot of headaches!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/mixin", "title": "@mixin and @include", "description": "Mixins allow you to define styles that can be re-used throughout your stylesheet.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Breaking Change: `@import` and global built-in functions is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Breaking Change: `@import` and global built-in functions in sass.\n\n# Breaking Change: `@import` and global built-in functions\n\nThis page discusses the deprecation of Sass `@import` rules and global built-in functions in favor of the module system, detailing the transition period, automatic migration options, and how to manage deprecation warnings.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Transition Period\n\nCompatibility:\n\nDart Sass since 1.80.0\n\nLibSass✗\n\nRuby Sass✗\n\nSass `@import` rules and global built-in function calls now emit deprecation warnings. While Dart Sass 2.0.0 will be released soon with various smaller breaking changes, we don’t expect to remove Sass `@import` rules or global built-in functions until Dart Sass 3.0.0, which will be released no sooner than two years after Dart Sass 1.80.0.\n\nEventually, all `@import` rules will be treated as plain CSS `@import`s, likely after an intermediate period where anything that used to be a Sass `@import` throws an error.\n\n## Automatic Migration\n\nYou can use the Sass migrator to automatically update your stylesheets to use the module system.\n\n```shellsession\n$ npm install -g sass-migrator\n$ sass-migrator module --migrate-deps your-entrypoint.scss\n```\n\nIf you want to migrate away from global built-in functions, but aren’t yet ready to fully migrate your `@import` rules, you can pass the `--built-in-only` flag to migrate the functions while leaving `@import` rules as-is.\n\n## Can I Silence the Warnings?\n\nSass provides a powerful suite of options for managing which deprecation warnings you see and when.\n\n## Terse and Verbose Mode\n\nBy default, Sass runs in terse mode, where it will only print each type of deprecation warning five times before it silences additional warnings. This helps ensure that users know when they need to be aware of an upcoming breaking change without creating an overwhelming amount of console noise.\n\nIf you run Sass in verbose mode instead, it will print _every_ deprecation warning it encounters. This can be useful for tracking the remaining work to be done when fixing deprecations. You can enable verbose mode using the `--verbose` flag on the command line, or the `verbose` option in the JavaScript API.\n\n## Heads up!\n\nWhen running from the JSAPI, Sass doesn’t share any information across compilations, so by default it’ll print five warnings for _each stylesheet_ that’s compiled. However, you can fix this by writing (or asking the author of your favorite framework’s Sass plugin to write) a custom `Logger` that only prints five errors per deprecation and can be shared across multiple compilations.\n\n## Silencing Deprecations in Dependencies\n\nSometimes, your dependencies have deprecation warnings that you can’t do anything about. You can silence deprecation warnings from dependencies while still printing them for your app using the `--quiet-deps` flag on the command line, or the `quietDeps` option in the JavaScript API.\n\nFor the purposes of this flag, a \"dependency\" is any stylesheet that’s not just a series of relative loads from the entrypoint stylesheet. This means anything that comes from a load path, and most stylesheets loaded through custom importers.\n\n## Silencing Specific Deprecations\n\nIf you know that one particular deprecation isn’t a problem for you, you can silence warnings for that specific deprecation using the `--silence-deprecation` flag on the command line, or the `silenceDeprecations` option in the JavaScript API.\n\nNote: While the deprecations for `@import` and global built-ins are being released together and we expect both features to be removed simultaneously as well (in Dart Sass 3.0.0), they are considered separate deprecations for the purpose of the API. If you wish to silence both `@import` deprecation warnings and global built-in deprecation warnings, you’ll need to pass both `import` and `global-builtin` to `--silence-deprecation`/ `silenceDeprecations`.\n\n## Current Releases\n\n- [Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass) [1.85.1](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases/tag/1.85.1)\n- [LibSass](https://sass-lang.com/libsass) [3.6.6](https://github.com/sass/libsass/releases/tag/3.6.6)\n- [Ruby Sass](https://sass-lang.com/ruby-sass) ⚰\n- [Implementation Guide](https://sass-lang.com/implementation)\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/import", "title": "Breaking Change: `@import` and global built-in functions", "description": "This page discusses the deprecation of Sass `@import` rules and global built-in functions in favor of the module system, detailing the transition period, automatic migration options, and how to manage deprecation warnings.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 8, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 23:17:13", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"description": "Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets", "title": "Sass: Breaking Change: `@import` and global built-in functions", "favicon": "https://sass-lang.com/icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "language": "en", "scrapeId": "3046edfc-1fee-4f49-adc7-d6ee42f693d0", "sourceURL": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/import", "url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/import/", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Breaking Change: abs()Percentage is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Breaking Change: abs()Percentage in sass.\n\n# Breaking Change: abs()Percentage\n\nThis page discusses the deprecation of the global abs() function with a percentage in Sass due to compatibility issues with CSS calculations.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Overview\n\nSass has historically supported the `abs()` function. After CSS supported calculations in Values and Units Level 4, we had to workaround backwards-compatibility. However, for the `abs()` function we posses a compatibility problem supporting the `%` unit.\n\nThe `abs()` global function in Sass supported the `%` unit as an input and would resolve the `abs()` function before resolving the `%` value. For instance, if the input was `abs(10%)` the function will return `10%`. As a result, if the value of `10%` represented `-50px` the function would return `-50px`.\n\nHowever, the CSS `abs()` abs function will resolve the `%` before resolving the function. Therefore if the value of `10%` represented `-50px`, `abs(10%)` would return `-10%` which in the browser would be `50px`.\n\nFor this reason, we are deprecating the global abs() function with a percentage. To preserve the current behavior, use `math.abs()` instead.\n\n## Can I Silence the Warnings?\n\nSass provides a powerful suite of options for managing which deprecation warnings you see and when.\n\n## Terse and Verbose Mode\n\nBy default, Sass runs in terse mode, where it will only print each type of deprecation warning five times before it silences additional warnings. This helps ensure that users know when they need to be aware of an upcoming breaking change without creating an overwhelming amount of console noise.\n\nIf you run Sass in verbose mode instead, it will print _every_ deprecation warning it encounters. This can be useful for tracking the remaining work to be done when fixing deprecations. You can enable verbose mode using the [`--verbose` flag](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass/#verbose) on the command line, or the [`verbose` option](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/interfaces/Options/#verbose) in the JavaScript API.\n\n## Heads up!\n\nWhen running from the [JSAPI](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/), Sass doesn’t share any information across compilations, so by default it’ll print five warnings for _each stylesheet_ that’s compiled. However, you can fix this by writing (or asking the author of your favorite framework’s Sass plugin to write) a [custom `Logger`](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/interfaces/Logger-1/) that only prints five errors per deprecation and can be shared across multiple compilations.\n\n## Silencing Deprecations in Dependencies\n\nSometimes, your dependencies have deprecation warnings that you can’t do anything about. You can silence deprecation warnings from dependencies while still printing them for your app using the [`--quiet-deps` flag](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass/#quiet-deps) on the command line, or the [`quietDeps` option](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/interfaces/Options/#quietDeps) in the JavaScript API.\n\nFor the purposes of this flag, a \"dependency\" is any stylesheet that’s not just a series of relative loads from the entrypoint stylesheet. This means anything that comes from a load path, and most stylesheets loaded through custom importers.\n\n## Silencing Specific Deprecations\n\nIf you know that one particular deprecation isn’t a problem for you, you can silence warnings for that specific deprecation using the [`--silence-deprecation` flag](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass/#silence-deprecation) on the command line, or the [`silenceDeprecations` option](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/interfaces/Options/#silenceDeprecations) in the JavaScript API.\n\n## Current Releases\n\n- [Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass) [1.85.1](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases/tag/1.85.1)\n- [LibSass](https://sass-lang.com/libsass) [3.6.6](https://github.com/sass/libsass/releases/tag/3.6.6)\n- [Ruby Sass](https://sass-lang.com/ruby-sass) ⚰\n- [Implementation Guide](https://sass-lang.com/implementation)\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/abs-percent", "title": "Breaking Change: abs()Percentage", "description": "This page discusses the deprecation of the global abs() function with a percentage in Sass due to compatibility issues with CSS calculations.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 7, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 23:26:25", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"description": "Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "language": "en", "favicon": "https://sass-lang.com/icon.png", "title": "Sass: Breaking Change: abs() Percentage", "scrapeId": "0db1b955-d6f8-4158-8bb0-0dd7b7d8a8b4", "sourceURL": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/abs-percent", "url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/abs-percent/", "statusCode": 200}}}

Therefore if the value of `10%` represented `-50px`, `abs(10%)` would return `-10%` which in the browser would be `50px`.\n\nFor this reason, we are deprecating the global abs() function with a percentage. To preserve the current behavior, use `math.abs()` instead..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/abs-percent", "title": "Breaking Change: abs()Percentage", "description": "This page discusses the deprecation of the global abs() function with a percentage in Sass due to compatibility issues with CSS calculations.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 7, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 23:26:25", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"description": "Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "language": "en", "favicon": "https://sass-lang.com/icon.png", "title": "Sass: Breaking Change: abs() Percentage", "scrapeId": "0db1b955-d6f8-4158-8bb0-0dd7b7d8a8b4", "sourceURL": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/abs-percent", "url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/abs-percent/", "statusCode": 200}}}

This helps ensure that users know when they need to be aware of an upcoming breaking change without creating an overwhelming amount of console noise.\n\nIf you run Sass in verbose mode instead, it will print _every_ deprecation warning it encounters. This can be useful for tracking the remaining work to be done when fixing deprecations. You can enable verbose mode using the [`--verbose` flag](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass/#verbose) on the command line, or the [`verbose` option](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/interfaces/Options/#verbose) in the JavaScript API..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/abs-percent", "title": "Breaking Change: abs()Percentage", "description": "This page discusses the deprecation of the global abs() function with a percentage in Sass due to compatibility issues with CSS calculations.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 7, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 23:26:25", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"description": "Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "language": "en", "favicon": "https://sass-lang.com/icon.png", "title": "Sass: Breaking Change: abs() Percentage", "scrapeId": "0db1b955-d6f8-4158-8bb0-0dd7b7d8a8b4", "sourceURL": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/abs-percent", "url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/abs-percent/", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Breaking Change: Extending CompoundSelectors is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Breaking Change: Extending CompoundSelectors in sass.\n\n# Breaking Change: Extending CompoundSelectors\n\nThis page discusses the breaking change in how compound selectors are extended in Sass, particularly focusing on the differences between Dart Sass, LibSass, and Ruby Sass.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Compatibility\n\nDart Sass✓\nLibSass✗\nRuby Sass✗\n\n## Current Behavior\n\nWhen one selector extends another, Sass styles all elements that match the extender as though they also match the class being extended. In other words, if you write `.heads-up {@extend .info}`, it works just like you replaced `class=\"heads-up\"` in your HTML with `class=\"heads-up info\"`.\n\nFollowing that logic, you’d expect that `.heads-up {@extend .message.info}` to work like replacing `class=\"heads-up\"` with `class=\"heads-up info message\"`. But that’s not how it works right now in LibSass and Ruby Sass–instead of adding `.heads-up` to every selector that has _either `.info` or `.message`_, it only adds it to selectors that have _`.info.message` together_.\n\n## SCSS Syntax Example (Bad)\n\n```scss\n// These should both be extended, but they won't be.\n.message {\n  border: 1px solid black;\n}\n.info {\n  font-size: 1.5rem;\n}\n\n.heads-up {\n  @extend .message.info;\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax Example (Bad)\n\n```sass\n// These should both be extended, but they won't be.\n.message\n  border: 1px solid black\n\n.info\n  font-size: 1.5rem\n\n.heads-up\n  @extend .message.info\n```\n\n## Recommended Fix\n\nTo fix this issue, avoid more confusion, and keep the implementation clean and efficient the ability to extend compound selectors is unsupported in Dart Sass and will be removed in a future version of LibSass. For compatibility, users should extend each simple selector separately.\n\n## SCSS Syntax Example (Good)\n\n```scss\n.message {\n  border: 1px solid black;\n}\n.info {\n  font-size: 1.5rem;\n}\n\n.heads-up {\n  @extend .message, .info;\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax Example (Good)\n\n```sass\n.message\n  border: 1px solid black\n\n.info\n  font-size: 1.5rem\n\n.heads-up\n  @extend .message, .info\n```\n\n## CSS Output Example\n\n```css\n.message, .heads-up {\n  border: 1px solid black;\n}\n\n.info, .heads-up {\n  font-size: 1.5rem;\n}\n```\n\n## ⚠️ Heads up!\n\nBecause Sass doesn’t know the details of the HTML the CSS is going to style, any `@extend` might need to generate extra selectors that won’t apply to your HTML in particular. This is especially true when switching away from extending compound selectors.\n\nMost of the time, these extra selectors won’t cause any problems, and will only add a couple extra bytes to gzipped CSS. But some stylesheets might be relying more heavily on the old behavior. In that case, we recommend replacing the compound selector with a [placeholder selector](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/style-rules/placeholder-selectors).\n\n## SCSS Syntax Example (Using Placeholder Selector)\n\n```scss\n// Instead of just `.message.info`.\n%message-info, .message.info {\n  border: 1px solid black;\n  font-size: 1.5rem;\n}\n\n.heads-up {\n  // Instead of `.message.info`.\n  @extend %message-info;\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax Example (Using Placeholder Selector)\n\n```sass\n// Instead of just `.message.info`.\n%message-info, .message.info\n  border: 1px solid black\n  font-size: 1.5rem\n\n.heads-up\n  // Instead of `.message.info`.\n  @extend %message-info\n```\n\n## CSS Output Example (Using Placeholder Selector)\n\n```css\n.heads-up, .message.info {\n  border: 1px solid black;\n  font-size: 1.5rem;\n}\n```\n\n## Current Releases\n\n- [Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass) [1.85.1](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases/tag/1.85.1)\n- [LibSass](https://sass-lang.com/libsass) [3.6.6](https://github.com/sass/libsass/releases/tag/3.6.6)\n- [Ruby Sass](https://sass-lang.com/ruby-sass) ⚰\n- [Implementation Guide](https://sass-lang.com/implementation)\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/extend-compound", "title": "Breaking Change: Extending CompoundSelectors", "description": "This page discusses the breaking change in how compound selectors are extended in Sass, particularly focusing on the differences between Dart Sass, LibSass, and Ruby Sass.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 13, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 23:39:09", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "favicon": "https://sass-lang.com/icon.png", "language": "en", "title": "Sass: Breaking Change: Extending Compound Selectors", "description": "Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets", "scrapeId": "119ec5d2-a1a7-4824-88e7-bf6b9ca0fee6", "sourceURL": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/extend-compound", "url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/extend-compound/", "statusCode": 200}}}

Supporting them added a substantial amount of complexity to Sass’s implementation, and made it particularly difficult to fix various bugs related to the `@extend` rule. As such, we made the decision to remove support for these uses.\n\n## Exception for Nesting\n\nThere is one major exception: leading and trailing combinators may still be used for nesting purposes.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Breaking Change: Strict FunctionUnits is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Breaking Change: Strict FunctionUnits in sass.\n\n# Breaking Change: Strict FunctionUnits\n\nVarious built-in functions will become stricter in which units they allow and will handle those units more consistently. This makes Sass more compatible with the CSS spec and helps catch errors more quickly.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Hue\n\nWhen specifying a color’s hue, CSS allows any angle unit ( `deg`, `grad`, `rad`, or `turn`). It also allows a unitless number, which is interpreted as `deg`. Historically, Sass has allowed _any_ unit, and interpreted it as `deg`. This is particularly problematic because it meant that the valid CSS expression `hsl(0.5turn, 100%, 50%)` would be allowed by Sass but interpreted entirely wrong.\n\nTo fix this issue and bring Sass in line with the CSS spec, we’re making changes in multiple phases:\n\n### Phase 1\nAt first, Sass just emitted a deprecation warning if you passed a number with a unit other than `deg` as a hue to any function. Passing a unitless number is still allowed.\n\n### Phase 2\nNext, we changed the way angle units are handled for hue parameters to match the CSS spec. This means that numbers with `grad`, `rad`, or `turn` units will be converted to `deg`: `0.5turn` will be converted to `180deg`, `100grad` will be converted to `90deg`, and soon.\n\nBecause this change is necessary to preserve CSS compatibility, according to the Dart Sass compatibility policy it was made with only a minor version bump. However, it changes as little behavior as possible to ensure that Sass interprets all valid CSS according to the CSS spec.\n\n### Phase 3\nFinally, in Dart Sass 2.0.0 color functions will throw errors if they’re passed a hue parameter with a non-angle unit. Unitless hues will still be allowed.\n\n## Saturation and Lightness\n\nWhen specifying an HSL color’s saturation and lightness, CSS only allows `%` units. Even unitless numbers aren’t allowed (unlike for the hue). Historically, Sass has allowed _any_ unit, and interpreted it as `%`. You could even write `hsl(0, 100px, 50s)` and Sass would return the color `red`.\n\nTo fix this issue and bring Sass in line with the CSS spec, we’re making changes in two phases:\n\n### Phase 1\nCurrently, Sass just emits a deprecation warning if you pass a number with no unit or a unit other than `%` as a lightness or saturation to any function.\n\n### Phase 2\nIn Dart Sass 2.0.0 color functions will throw errors if they’re passed a saturation or lightness parameter with no unit or a non- `%` unit.\n\n## Alpha\n\nWhen specifying a color’s alpha value, CSS allows either unitless values between 0 and 1 or `%` values between `0%` and `100%`. In most cases Sass follows this behavior, but the functions `color.adjust()` and `color.change()` have historically allowed _any_ unit, and interpreted it as unitless. You could even write `color.change(red, $alpha: 1%)` and Sass would return the opaque color `red`.\n\nTo fix this issue and bring Sass in line with the CSS spec, we’re making changes in three phases:\n\n### Phase 1\nCurrently, Sass just emits a deprecation warning if you pass a number with any unit, including `%`, as an alpha value to `color.change()` or `color.adjust()`.\n\n### Phase 2\nNext, we’ll change the way `%` units are handled for the alpha argument to `color.change()` and `color.adjust()`. Alphas with unit `%` will be divided by `100%`, converting them to unitless numbers between 0 and 1.\n\nBecause this change is a bug fix that improves consistency with other Sass functions, it will be made with only a minor version bump. It will be changed at minimum three months after Phase 1 is released, to give users time to adjust their code and avoid the bug.\n\n### Phase 3\nFinally, in Dart Sass 2.0.0 `color.change()` and `color.adjust()` will throw errors if they’re passed an alpha parameter with a non- `%` unit. Unitless alphas will still be allowed.\n\n## math.random()\n\nThe `math.random()` function has historically ignored units in `$limit` and returned a unitless value. For example `math.random(100px)` would drop \"px\" and return a value like `42`.\n\nA future version of Sass will stop ignoring units for the `$limit` argument and return a random integer with the same units.\n\n### SCSS Syntax\n```scss\n@use \"sass:math\";\n\n// Future Sass, doesn't work yet!\n@debug math.random(100px); // 42px\n```\n\n### Sass Syntax\n```sass\n@use \"sass:math\"\n\n// Future Sass, doesn't work yet!\n@debug math.random(100px)  // 42px\n```\n\n### Phase 1\nCurrently, Sass emits a deprecation warning if you pass a `$limit` with units to `math.random()`.\n\n### Phase 2\nIn Dart Sass 2.0.0, passing a `$limit` number with units will be an error.\n\n## Weight\n\nThe `color.mix()` function and `color.invert()` function have both historically ignored units in their `$weight` arguments, despite that argument conceptually representing a percentage. A future version of Sass will require the unit `%`.\n\n### Phase 1\nCurrently, Sass emits a deprecation warning if you pass a `$weight` with no units or with units other than `%` to `color.mix()` or `color.invert()`.\n\n### Phase 2\nIn Dart Sass 2.0.0, `color.mix()` and `color.invert()` will throw errors if they’re passed a `$weight` with no unit or a non- `%` unit.\n\n## Index\n\nThe `list.nth()` function and `list.set-nth()` function have both historically ignored units in their `$n` arguments. A future version of Sass will forbid any units.\n\n### Phase 1\nCurrently, Sass emits a deprecation warning if you pass an index `$n` with units to `list.nth()` or `list.set-nth()`.\n\n### Phase 2\nIn Dart Sass 2.0.0, `list.nth()` and `list.set-nth()` will throw errors if they’re passed an index `$n` with a unit.\n\n## Can I Silence the Warnings?\n\nSass provides a powerful suite of options for managing which deprecation warnings you see and when.\n\n### Terse and Verbose Mode\nBy default, Sass runs in terse mode, where it will only print each type of deprecation warning five times before it silences additional warnings. This helps ensure that users know when they need to be aware of an upcoming breaking change without creating an overwhelming amount of console noise.\n\nIf you run Sass in verbose mode instead, it will print _every_ deprecation warning it encounters. This can be useful for tracking the remaining work to be done when fixing deprecations. You can enable verbose mode using the `--verbose` flag on the command line, or the `verbose` option in the JavaScript API.\n\n### Heads up!\nWhen running from the JSAPI, Sass doesn’t share any information across compilations, so by default it’ll print five warnings for _each stylesheet_ that’s compiled. However, you can fix this by writing (or asking the author of your favorite framework’s Sass plugin to write) a custom `Logger` that only prints five errors per deprecation and can be shared across multiple compilations.\n\n### Silencing Deprecations in Dependencies\nSometimes, your dependencies have deprecation warnings that you can’t do anything about. You can silence deprecation warnings from dependencies while still printing them for your app using the `--quiet-deps` flag on the command line, or the `quietDeps` option in the JavaScript API.\n\n### Silencing Specific Deprecations\nIf you know that one particular deprecation isn’t a problem for you, you can silence warnings for that specific deprecation using the `--silence-deprecation` flag on the command line, or the `silenceDeprecations` option in the JavaScript API.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/function-units", "title": "Breaking Change: Strict FunctionUnits", "description": "Various built-in functions will become stricter in which units they allow and will handle those units more consistently.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: How do I hue in sass?\n\nAssistant: To hue in sass, here's what you do:\nWhen specifying a color’s hue, CSS allows any angle unit ( `deg`, `grad`, `rad`, or `turn`). It also allows a unitless number, which is interpreted as `deg`. Historically, Sass has allowed _any_ unit, and interpreted it as `deg`. This is particularly problematic because it meant that the valid CSS expression `hsl(0.5turn, 100%, 50%)` would be allowed by Sass but interpreted entirely wrong.\n\nTo fix this issue and bring Sass in line with the CSS spec, we’re making changes in multiple phases:\n\n### Phase 1\nAt first, Sass just emitted a deprecation warning if you passed a number with a unit other than `deg` as a hue to any function. Passing a unitless number is still allowed.\n\n### Phase 2\nNext, we changed the way angle units are handled for hue parameters to match the CSS spec. This means that numbers with `grad`, `rad`, or `turn` units will be converted to `deg`: `0.5turn` will be converted to `180deg`, `100grad` will be converted to `90deg`, and soon.\n\nBecause this change is necessary to preserve CSS compatibility, according to the Dart Sass compatibility policy it was made with only a minor version bump. However, it changes as little behavior as possible to ensure that Sass interprets all valid CSS according to the CSS spec.\n\n### Phase 3\nFinally, in Dart Sass 2.0.0 color functions will throw errors if they’re passed a hue parameter with a non-angle unit.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Parent Selector is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Parent Selector in sass.\n\n# Parent Selector\n\nThe parent selector, `&`, is a special selector invented by Sass that’s used in nested selectors to refer to the outer selector. It makes it possible to re-use the outer selector in more complex ways, like adding a pseudo-class or adding a selector before the parent.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n.alert {\n  // The parent selector can be used to add pseudo-classes to the outer\n  // selector.\n  &:hover {\n    font-weight: bold;\n  }\n\n  // It can also be used to style the outer selector in a certain context, such\n  // as a body set to use a right-to-left language.\n  [dir=rtl] & {\n    margin-left: 0;\n    margin-right: 10px;\n  }\n\n  // You can even use it as an argument to pseudo-class selectors.\n  :not(&) {\n    opacity: 0.8;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n.alert\n  // The parent selector can be used to add pseudo-classes to the outer\n  // selector.\n  &:hover\n    font-weight: bold\n\n  // It can also be used to style the outer selector in a certain context, such\n  // as a body set to use a right-to-left language.\n  [dir=rtl] &\n    margin-left: 0\n    margin-right: 10px\n\n  // You can even use it as an argument to pseudo-class selectors.\n  :not(&)\n    opacity: 0.8\n```\n\n## CSS Output\n\n```css\n.alert:hover {\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n[dir=rtl] .alert {\n  margin-left: 0;\n  margin-right: 10px;\n}\n:not(.alert) {\n  opacity: 0.8;\n}\n```\n\n## Heads up!\n\nBecause the parent selector could be replaced by a type selector like `h1`, it’s only allowed at the beginning of compound selectors where a type selector would also be allowed. For example, `span&` is not allowed. We’re looking into loosening this restriction, though. If you’d like to help make that happen, check out [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/sass/sass/issues/1425).\n\n## Adding Suffixes\n\nYou can also use the parent selector to add extra suffixes to the outer selector. This is particularly useful when using a methodology like BEM that uses highly structured class names. As long as the outer selector ends with an alphanumeric name (like class, ID, and element selectors), you can use the parent selector to append additional text.\n\n## SCSS Syntax for Adding Suffixes\n\n```scss\n.accordion {\n  max-width: 600px;\n  margin: 4rem auto;\n  width: 90%;\n  font-family: \"Raleway\", sans-serif;\n  background: #f4f4f4;\n\n  &__copy {\n    display: none;\n    padding: 1rem 1.5rem 2rem 1.5rem;\n    color: gray;\n    line-height: 1.6;\n    font-size: 14px;\n    font-weight: 500;\n\n    &--open {\n      display: block;\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax for Adding Suffixes\n\n```sass\n.accordion\n  max-width: 600px\n  margin: 4rem auto\n  width: 90%\n  font-family: \"Raleway\", sans-serif\n  background: #f4f4f4\n\n  &__copy\n    display: none\n    padding: 1rem 1.5rem 2rem 1.5rem\n    color: gray\n    line-height: 1.6\n    font-size: 14px\n    font-weight: 500\n\n    &--open\n      display: block\n```\n\n## CSS Output for Adding Suffixes\n\n```css\n.accordion {\n  max-width: 600px;\n  margin: 4rem auto;\n  width: 90%;\n  font-family: \"Raleway\", sans-serif;\n  background: #f4f4f4;\n}\n.accordion__copy {\n  display: none;\n  padding: 1rem 1.5rem 2rem 1.5rem;\n  color: gray;\n  line-height: 1.6;\n  font-size: 14px;\n  font-weight: 500;\n}\n.accordion__copy--open {\n  display: block;\n}\n```\n\n## In SassScript\n\nThe parent selector can also be used within SassScript. It’s a special expression that returns the current parent selector in the same format used by selector functions: a comma-separated list (the selector list) that contains space-separated lists (the complex selectors) that contain unquoted strings (the compound selectors).\n\n## SCSS Syntax in SassScript\n\n```scss\n.main aside:hover,\n.sidebar p {\n  parent-selector: &;\n  // => ((unquote(\".main\") unquote(\"aside:hover\")),\n  //     (unquote(\".sidebar\") unquote(\"p\")))\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax in SassScript\n\n```sass\n.main aside:hover,\n.sidebar p\n  parent-selector: &\n  // => ((unquote(\".main\") unquote(\"aside:hover\")),\n  //     (unquote(\".sidebar\") unquote(\"p\")))\n```\n\n## CSS Output in SassScript\n\n```css\n.main aside:hover,\n.sidebar p {\n  parent-selector: .main aside:hover, .sidebar p;\n}\n```\n\n## Using Parent Selector in Mixins\n\nIf the `&` expression is used outside any style rules, it returns `null`. Since `null` is falsey, this means you can easily use it to determine whether a mixin is being called in a style rule or not.\n\n## SCSS Syntax for Mixins\n\n```scss\n@mixin app-background($color) {\n  #{if(&, '&.app-background', '.app-background')} {\n    background-color: $color;\n    color: rgba(#fff, 0.75);\n  }\n}\n\n@include app-background(#036);\n\n.sidebar {\n  @include app-background(#c6538c);\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax for Mixins\n\n```sass\n@mixin app-background($color)\n  #{if(&, '&.app-background', '.app-background')}\n    background-color: $color\n    color: rgba(#fff, 0.75)\n\n@include app-background(#036)\n\n.sidebar\n  @include app-background(#c6538c)\n```\n\n## CSS Output for Mixins\n\n```css\n.app-background {\n  background-color: #036;\n  color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.75);\n}\n\n.sidebar.app-background {\n  background-color: #c6538c;\n  color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.75);\n}\n```\n\n## Advanced Nesting\n\nYou can use `&` as a normal SassScript expression, which means you can pass it to functions or include it in interpolation—even in other selectors! Using it in combination with selector functions and the `@at-root` rule allows you to nest selectors in very powerful ways.\n\n## SCSS Syntax for Advanced Nesting\n\n```scss\n@use \"sass:selector\";\n\n@mixin unify-parent($child) {\n  @at-root #{selector.unify(&, $child)} {\n    @content;\n  }\n}\n\n.wrapper .field {\n  @include unify-parent(\"input\") {\n    /* ... */\n  }\n  @include unify-parent(\"select\") {\n    /* ... */\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax for Advanced Nesting\n\n```sass\n@use \"sass:selector\"\n\n@mixin unify-parent($child)\n  @at-root #{selector.unify(&, $child)}\n    @content\n\n.wrapper .field\n  @include unify-parent(\"input\")\n    /* ... */\n\n  @include unify-parent(\"select\")\n    /* ... */\n```\n\n## CSS Output for Advanced Nesting\n\n```css\n.wrapper input.field {\n  /* ... */\n}\n\n.wrapper select.field {\n  /* ... */\n}\n```\n\n## Heads up!\n\nWhen Sass is nesting selectors, it doesn’t know what interpolation was used to generate them. This means it will automatically add the outer selector to the inner selector even if you used `&` as a SassScript expression. That’s why you need to explicitly use the `@at-root` rule to tell Sass not to include the outer selector.\n\n## Current Releases\n\n- [Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass) [1.85.1](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases/tag/1.85.1)\n- [LibSass](https://sass-lang.com/libsass) [3.6.6](https://github.com/sass/libsass/releases/tag/3.6.6)\n- [Ruby Sass](https://sass-lang.com/ruby-sass) ⚰\n- [Implementation Guide](https://sass-lang.com/implementation)\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/style-rules/parent-selector", "title": "Parent Selector", "description": "The parent selector, `&`, is a special selector invented by Sass that’s used in nested selectors to refer to the outer selector.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Breaking Change: -moz-document is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Breaking Change: -moz-document in sass.\n\n# Breaking Change: -moz-document\n\nFirefox used to have a @-moz-document rule requiring special parsing. As support is removed from Firefox, Sass is in the process of removing support for parsing them.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@-moz-document url-prefix() {\n  .error {\n    color: red;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@-moz-document url-prefix()\n  .error\n    color: red\n```\n\n## CSS Output\n\n```css\n@-moz-document url-prefix() {\n  .error {\n    color: red;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Transition Period\n\nCompatibility:\n\nDart Sass since 1.7.2\n\nLibSass✗\n\nRuby Sass✗\n\nFirst, we’ll emit deprecation warnings for all usages of `@-moz-document` except for the empty url-prefix hack.\n\nIn Dart Sass 2.0, `@-moz-document` will be treated as an unknown at-rule.\n\n## Can I Silence the Warnings?\n\nSass provides a powerful suite of options for managing which deprecation warnings you see and when.\n\n## Terse and Verbose Mode\n\nBy default, Sass runs in terse mode, where it will only print each type of deprecation warning five times before it silences additional warnings. This helps ensure that users know when they need to be aware of an upcoming breaking change without creating an overwhelming amount of console noise.\n\nIf you run Sass in verbose mode instead, it will print _every_ deprecation warning it encounters. This can be useful for tracking the remaining work to be done when fixing deprecations. You can enable verbose mode using the [`--verbose` flag](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass/#verbose) on the command line, or the [`verbose` option](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/interfaces/Options/#verbose) in the JavaScript API.\n\n## Heads up!\n\nWhen running from the [JSAPI](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/), Sass doesn’t share any information across compilations, so by default it’ll print five warnings for _each stylesheet_ that’s compiled. However, you can fix this by writing (or asking the author of your favorite framework’s Sass plugin to write) a [custom `Logger`](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/interfaces/Logger-1/) that only prints five errors per deprecation and can be shared across multiple compilations.\n\n## Silencing Deprecations in Dependencies\n\nSometimes, your dependencies have deprecation warnings that you can’t do anything about. You can silence deprecation warnings from dependencies while still printing them for your app using the [`--quiet-deps` flag](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass/#quiet-deps) on the command line, or the [`quietDeps` option](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/interfaces/Options/#quietDeps) in the JavaScript API.\n\n## Silencing Specific Deprecations\n\nIf you know that one particular deprecation isn’t a problem for you, you can silence warnings for that specific deprecation using the [`--silence-deprecation` flag](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass/#silence-deprecation) on the command line, or the [`silenceDeprecations` option](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/interfaces/Options/#silenceDeprecations) in the JavaScript API.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/moz-document", "title": "Breaking Change: -moz-document", "description": "Firefox used to have a @-moz-document rule requiring special parsing.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Placeholder Selectors is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Placeholder Selectors in sass.\n\n# Placeholder Selectors\n\nSass has a special kind of selector known as a 'placeholder'. It looks and acts a lot like a class selector, but it starts with a '%' and it’s not included in the CSS output.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n.alert:hover, %strong-alert {\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n\n%strong-alert:hover {\n  color: red;\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n.alert:hover, %strong-alert\n  font-weight: bold\n\n%strong-alert:hover\n  color: red\n```\n\n## CSS Output\n\n```css\n.alert:hover {\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n```\n\n## Extended Selectors\n\nWhat’s the use of a selector that isn’t emitted? It can still be [extended](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/extend)! Unlike class selectors, placeholders don’t clutter up the CSS if they aren’t extended and they don’t mandate that users of a library use specific class names for their HTML.\n\n## SCSS Syntax for Extended Selectors\n\n```scss\n%toolbelt {\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n  border-top: 1px rgba(#000, .12) solid;\n  padding: 16px 0;\n  width: 100%;\n\n  &:hover { border: 2px rgba(#000, .5) solid; }\n}\n\n.action-buttons {\n  @extend %toolbelt;\n  color: #4285f4;\n}\n\n.reset-buttons {\n  @extend %toolbelt;\n  color: #cddc39;\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax for Extended Selectors\n\n```sass\n%toolbelt\n  box-sizing: border-box\n  border-top: 1px rgba(#000, .12) solid\n  padding: 16px 0\n  width: 100%\n\n  &:hover\n    border: 2px rgba(#000, .5) solid\n\n.action-buttons\n  @extend %toolbelt\n  color: #4285f4\n\n.reset-buttons\n  @extend %toolbelt\n  color: #cddc39\n```\n\n## CSS Output for Extended Selectors\n\n```css\n.reset-buttons, .action-buttons {\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n  border-top: 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12) solid;\n  padding: 16px 0;\n  width: 100%;\n}\n.reset-buttons:hover, .action-buttons:hover {\n  border: 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5) solid;\n}\n\n.action-buttons {\n  color: #4285f4;\n}\n\n.reset-buttons {\n  color: #cddc39;\n}\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nPlaceholder selectors are useful when writing a Sass library where each style rule may or may not be used. As a rule of thumb, if you’re writing a stylesheet just for your own app, it’s often better to just extend a class selector if one is available.\n\n## Current Releases\n\n- [Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass) [1.85.1](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases/tag/1.85.1)\n- [LibSass](https://sass-lang.com/libsass) [3.6.6](https://github.com/sass/libsass/releases/tag/3.6.6)\n- [Ruby Sass](https://sass-lang.com/ruby-sass) ⚰\n- [Implementation Guide](https://sass-lang.com/implementation)\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/style-rules/placeholder-selectors", "title": "Placeholder Selectors", "description": "Sass has a special kind of selector known as a 'placeholder'.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Breaking Change: meta.feature-exists() is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Breaking Change: meta.feature-exists() in sass.\n\n# Breaking Change: meta.feature-exists()\n\nThe `meta.feature-exists()` function is deprecated and will be removed in Dart Sass 2.0.0. Users should use other methods to determine if a new feature is available.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Transition Period\n\nCompatibility:\n\nDart Sass since 1.78.0\n\nLibSass✗\n\nRuby Sass✗\n\nFirst, we’ll emit deprecation warnings for all usages of `feature-exists`.\n\nIn Dart Sass 2.0.0, `meta.feature-exists()` will no longer exist. Attempts to call it will throw an error, and attempts to call the global `feature-exists()` function will be treated as a plain CSS function call.\n\n## Can I Silence the Warnings?\n\nSass provides a powerful suite of options for managing which deprecation warnings you see and when.\n\n## Terse and Verbose Mode\n\nBy default, Sass runs in terse mode, where it will only print each type of deprecation warning five times before it silences additional warnings. This helps ensure that users know when they need to be aware of an upcoming breaking change without creating an overwhelming amount of console noise.\n\nIf you run Sass in verbose mode instead, it will print _every_ deprecation warning it encounters. This can be useful for tracking the remaining work to be done when fixing deprecations. You can enable verbose mode using the [`--verbose` flag](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass/#verbose) on the command line, or the [`verbose` option](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/interfaces/Options/#verbose) in the JavaScript API.\n\n## Heads up!\n\nWhen running from the [JSAPI](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/), Sass doesn’t share any information across compilations, so by default it’ll print five warnings for _each stylesheet_ that’s compiled. However, you can fix this by writing (or asking the author of your favorite framework’s Sass plugin to write) a [custom `Logger`](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/interfaces/Logger-1/) that only prints five errors per deprecation and can be shared across multiple compilations.\n\n## Silencing Deprecations in Dependencies\n\nSometimes, your dependencies have deprecation warnings that you can’t do anything about. You can silence deprecation warnings from dependencies while still printing them for your app using the [`--quiet-deps` flag](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass/#quiet-deps) on the command line, or the [`quietDeps` option](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/interfaces/Options/#quietDeps) in the JavaScript API.\n\nFor the purposes of this flag, a \"dependency\" is any stylesheet that’s not just a series of relative loads from the entrypoint stylesheet. This means anything that comes from a load path, and most stylesheets loaded through custom importers.\n\n## Silencing Specific Deprecations\n\nIf you know that one particular deprecation isn’t a problem for you, you can silence warnings for that specific deprecation using the [`--silence-deprecation` flag](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass/#silence-deprecation) on the command line, or the [`silenceDeprecations` option](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/interfaces/Options/#silenceDeprecations) in the JavaScript API.\n\n## Current Releases\n\n- [Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass) [1.85.1](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases/tag/1.85.1)\n- [LibSass](https://sass-lang.com/libsass) [3.6.6](https://github.com/sass/libsass/releases/tag/3.6.6)\n- [Ruby Sass](https://sass-lang.com/ruby-sass) ⚰\n- [Implementation Guide](https://sass-lang.com/implementation)\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/feature-exists", "title": "Breaking Change: meta.feature-exists()", "description": "The `meta.feature-exists()` function is deprecated and will be removed in Dart Sass 2.0.0.

Not only that, it’s often better to use [`color.scale()`](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/color/#scale) anyway, because it’s better suited for making changes relative to the existing color rather than in absolute terms.

This helps ensure that users know when they need to be aware of an upcoming breaking change without creating an overwhelming amount of console noise.\n\nIf you run Sass in verbose mode instead, it will print _every_ deprecation warning it encounters. This can be useful for tracking the remaining work to be done when fixing deprecations. You can enable verbose mode using the [`--verbose` flag](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass/#verbose) on the command line, or the [`verbose` option](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/interfaces/Options/#verbose) in the JavaScript API.\n\n## Heads up!\n\nWhen running from the [JSAPI](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/), Sass doesn’t share any information across compilations, so by default it’ll print five warnings for _each stylesheet_ that’s compiled. However, you can fix this by writing (or asking the author of your favorite framework’s Sass plugin to write) a [custom `Logger`](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/interfaces/Logger-1/) that only prints five errors per deprecation and can be shared across multiple compilations.\n\n## Silencing Deprecations in Dependencies\n\nSometimes, your dependencies have deprecation warnings that you can’t do anything about. You can silence deprecation warnings from dependencies while still printing them for your app using the [`--quiet-deps` flag](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass/#quiet-deps) on the command line, or the [`quietDeps` option](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/interfaces/Options/#quietDeps) in the JavaScript API.\n\n## Silencing Specific Deprecations\n\nIf you know that one particular deprecation isn’t a problem for you, you can silence warnings for that specific deprecation using the [`--silence-deprecation` flag](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass/#silence-deprecation) on the command line, or the [`silenceDeprecations` option](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/interfaces/Options/#silenceDeprecations) in the JavaScript API.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/color-functions", "title": "Breaking Change: ColorFunctions", "description": "This page discusses the breaking changes in Sass color functions due to the support for CSS Color4, including deprecated functions and new alternatives.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 12, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 23:59:05", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "language": "en", "favicon": "https://sass-lang.com/icon.png", "description": "Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets", "title": "Sass: Breaking Change: Color Functions", "scrapeId": "c6368301-6f08-4ba9-83e6-feb18d546516", "sourceURL": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/color-functions", "url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/color-functions/", "statusCode": 200}}}

Its final argument will always be a callback, which it should call with the result of the function once it's done running.\n\nIf this throws an error, Sass will treat that as the function failing with that error message.\n\n## Code Example\n\n```js\nsass.render({\n  file: 'style.scss',\n  functions: {\n    \"sum($arg1, $arg2)\": (arg1, arg2, done) => {\n      if (!(arg1 instanceof sass.types.Number)) {\n        throw new Error(\"$arg1: Expected a number\");\n      } else if (!(arg2 instanceof sass.types.Number)) {\n        throw new Error(\"$arg2: Expected a number\");\n      }\n      done(new sass.types.Number(arg1.getValue() + arg2.getValue()));\n    }\n  }\n}, (result, error) => {\n  // ...\n});\n```\n\n## Arguments Handling\n\nThis is passed one argument for each argument that's declared in the signature that's passed to functions. If the signature takes arbitrary arguments, they're passed as a single argument list in the last argument before the callback.\n\n## Deprecation Notice\n\nThis only works with the legacy render and renderSync APIs. Use CustomFunction with compile, compileString, compileAsync, and compileStringAsync instead.\n\n## Current Releases\n\n- [Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass) [1.85.1](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases/tag/1.85.1)\n- [LibSass](https://sass-lang.com/libsass) [3.6.6](https://github.com/sass/libsass/releases/tag/3.6.6)\n- [Ruby Sass](https://sass-lang.com/ruby-sass) ⚰\n- [Implementation Guide](https://sass-lang.com/implementation)\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/types/legacyasyncfunction", "title": "LegacyAsyncFunction", "description": "An asynchronous callback that implements a custom Sass function.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Breaking Change: CSS VariableSyntax is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Breaking Change: CSS VariableSyntax in sass.\n\n# Breaking Change: CSS VariableSyntax\n\nThis page discusses the breaking changes related to CSS variable syntax in Sass, including compatibility and examples of SCSS and CSS output.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Compatibility\n\nDart Sass✓\nLibSass since 3.5.0\nRuby Sass since 3.5.0\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n:root {\n  --flex-theme: {\n    border: 1px solid var(--theme-dark-blue);\n    font-family: var(--theme-font-family);\n    padding: var(--theme-wide-padding);\n    background-color: var(--theme-light-blue);\n  };\n}\n```\n\n## CSS Output\n\n```css\n:root {\n  --flex-theme: {\n    border: 1px solid var(--theme-dark-blue);\n    font-family: var(--theme-font-family);\n    padding: var(--theme-wide-padding);\n    background-color: var(--theme-light-blue);\n  };\n}\n```\n\n## Interpolation Requirement\n\nTo provide maximum compatibility with plain CSS, more recent versions of Sass require SassScript expressions in custom property values to be written within interpolation. Interpolation will also work for older Sass versions, and so is recommended for all stylesheets.\n\n## SCSS Syntax with Interpolation\n\n```scss\n$accent-color: #fbbc04;\n\n:root {\n  // WRONG, will not work in recent Sass versions.\n  --accent-color-wrong: $accent-color;\n\n  // RIGHT, will work in all Sass versions.\n  --accent-color-right: #{$accent-color};\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax with Interpolation\n\n```sass\n$accent-color: #fbbc04\n\n:root\n  // WRONG, will not work in recent Sass versions.\n  --accent-color-wrong: $accent-color\n\n  // RIGHT, will work in all Sass versions.\n  --accent-color-right: #{$accent-color}\n```\n\n## Heads up!\n\nBecause interpolation removes quotation marks from quoted strings, it may be necessary to wrap them in the `meta.inspect()` function to preserve their quotes.\n\n## SCSS Syntax with meta.inspect()\n\n```scss\n@use \"sass:meta\";\n\n$font-family-monospace: Menlo, Consolas, \"Courier New\", monospace;\n\n:root {\n  --font-family-monospace: #{meta.inspect($font-family-monospace)};\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax with meta.inspect()\n\n```sass\n@use \"sass:meta\"\n\n$font-family-monospace: Menlo, Consolas, \"Courier New\", monospace\n\n:root\n  --font-family-monospace: #{meta.inspect($font-family-monospace)}\n```\n\n## Current Releases\n\n- Dart Sass [1.85.1](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases/tag/1.85.1)\n- LibSass [3.6.6](https://github.com/sass/libsass/releases/tag/3.6.6)\n- Ruby Sass ⚰\n- [Implementation Guide](https://sass-lang.com/implementation)\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/css-vars", "title": "Breaking Change: CSS VariableSyntax", "description": "This page discusses the breaking changes related to CSS variable syntax in Sass, including compatibility and examples of SCSS and CSS output.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 10, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 00:03:23", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"description": "Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "title": "Sass: Breaking Change: CSS Variable Syntax", "language": "en", "favicon": "https://sass-lang.com/icon.png", "scrapeId": "547bd43c-d39f-4127-8428-e9336b9ccda3", "sourceURL": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/css-vars", "url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/css-vars/", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what @if and @else is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain @if and @else in sass.\n\n# @if and @else\n\nThis documentation covers the usage of the @if and @else rules in Sass, including syntax examples and CSS output.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## @if\n\nThe `@if` rule is written `@if <expression> { ... }`, and it controls whether or not its block gets evaluated (including emitting any styles as CSS). The [expression](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax/structure#expressions) usually returns either [`true` or `false`](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/booleans)—if the expression returns `true`, the block is evaluated, and if the expression returns `false` it’s not.\n\n- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/control/if/#example-example-if-scss)\n- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/control/if/#example-example-if-sass)\n- [CSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/control/if/#example-example-if-css) \n\n### SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@use \"sass:math\";\n\n@mixin avatar($size, $circle: false) {\n  width: $size;\n  height: $size;\n\n  @if $circle {\n    border-radius: math.div($size, 2);\n  }\n}\n\n.square-av {\n  @include avatar(100px, $circle: false);\n}\n.circle-av {\n  @include avatar(100px, $circle: true);\n}\n```\n\n### CSS Output\n\n```css\n.square-av {\n  width: 100px;\n  height: 100px;\n}\n\n.circle-av {\n  width: 100px;\n  height: 100px;\n  border-radius: 50px;\n}\n```\n\n## @else\n\nAn `@if` rule can optionally be followed by an `@else` rule, written `@else { ... }`. This rule’s block is evaluated if the `@if` expression returns `false`.\n\n- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/control/if/#example-if-scss)\n- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/control/if/#example-if-sass)\n- [CSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/control/if/#example-if-css) \n\n### SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n$light-background: #f2ece4;\n$light-text: #036;\n$dark-background: #6b717f;\n$dark-text: #d2e1dd;\n\n@mixin theme-colors($light-theme: true) {\n  @if $light-theme {\n    background-color: $light-background;\n    color: $light-text;\n  } @else {\n    background-color: $dark-background;\n    color: $dark-text;\n  }\n}\n\n.banner {\n  @include theme-colors($light-theme: true);\n  body.dark & {\n    @include theme-colors($light-theme: false);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### CSS Output\n\n```css\n.banner {\n  background-color: #f2ece4;\n  color: #036;\n}\nbody.dark .banner {\n  background-color: #6b717f;\n  color: #d2e1dd;\n}\n```\n\n## @else if\n\nYou can also choose whether to evaluate an `@else` rule’s block by writing it `@else if <expression> { ... }`. If you do, the block is evaluated only if the preceding `@if`’s expression returns `false` _and_ the `@else if`’s expression returns `true`.\n\nIn fact, you can chain as many `@else if` s as you want after an `@if`. The first block in the chain whose expression returns `true` will be evaluated, and no others. If there’s a plain `@else` at the end of the chain, its block will be evaluated if every other block fails.\n\n- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/control/if/#example-else-scss)\n- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/control/if/#example-else-sass)\n- [CSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/control/if/#example-else-css) \n\n### SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@use \"sass:math\";\n\n@mixin triangle($size, $color, $direction) {\n  height: 0;\n  width: 0;\n\n  border-color: transparent;\n  border-style: solid;\n  border-width: math.div($size, 2);\n\n  @if $direction == up {\n    border-bottom-color: $color;\n  } @else if $direction == right {\n    border-left-color: $color;\n  } @else if $direction == down {\n    border-top-color: $color;\n  } @else if $direction == left {\n    border-right-color: $color;\n  } @else {\n    @error \"Unknown direction #{$direction}.\";\n  }\n}\n\n.next {\n  @include triangle(5px, black, right);\n}\n```\n\n### CSS Output\n\n```css\n.next {\n  height: 0;\n  width: 0;\n  border-color: transparent;\n  border-style: solid;\n  border-width: 2.5px;\n  border-left-color: black;\n}\n```\n\n## Truthiness and Falsiness\n\nAnywhere `true` or `false` are allowed, you can use other values as well. The values `false` and [`null`](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/null) are _falsey_, which means Sass considers them to indicate falsehood and cause conditions to fail. Every other value is considered _truthy_, so Sass considers them to work like `true` and cause conditions to succeed.\n\nFor example, if you want to check if a string contains a space, you can just write `string.index($string, \" \")`. The [`string.index()` function](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/string#index) returns `null` if the string isn’t found and a number otherwise.\n\n### ⚠️ Heads up!\n\nSome languages consider more values falsey than just `false` and `null`. Sass isn’t one of those languages! Empty strings, empty lists, and the number `0` are all truthy in Sass.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/control/if", "title": "@if and @else", "description": "This documentation covers the usage of the @if and @else rules in Sass, including syntax examples and CSS output.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 4, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 00:06:02", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "title": "Sass: @if and @else", "favicon": "https://sass-lang.com/icon.png", "language": "en", "description": "Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets", "scrapeId": "cf338de5-9690-4e8f-bd8a-0abd6420bbf7", "sourceURL": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/control/if", "url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/control/if/", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Breaking Change: Media Queries Level4 is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Breaking Change: Media Queries Level4 in sass.\n\n# Breaking Change: Media Queries Level4\n\nSass has added support for the CSS Media Queries Level 4 specification, which originally conflicted with some Sass-specific syntax that has now been deprecated.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Compatibility\n\nDart Sass since 1.56.0\n\nLibSass ✗\n\nRuby Sass ✗\n\n## Changes in Media Queries Interpretation\n\nBecause Sass supports almost any Sass expression in parenthesized media conditions, there were a few constructs whose meaning was changed by adding full support for Media Queries Level 4. Specifically:\n\n- `@media (not (foo))` was historically interpreted by Sass as meaning `@media (#{not (foo)})`, and so compiled to `@media (false)`.\n\n- `@media ((foo) and (bar))` and `@media ((foo) or (bar))` were similarly interpreted as SassScript’s logical operators, compiling to `@media (bar)` and `@media (foo)` respectively.\n\nFortunately, these came up very infrequently in practice.\n\n## Transition Period\n\nFirst, we emitted deprecation warnings for the previous ambiguous cases. These will have suggestions for how to preserve the existing behavior or how to use the new CSS syntax.\n\n## Can I Silence the Warnings?\n\nSass provides a powerful suite of options for managing which deprecation warnings you see and when.\n\n## Terse and Verbose Mode\n\nBy default, Sass runs in terse mode, where it will only print each type of deprecation warning five times before it silences additional warnings. This helps ensure that users know when they need to be aware of an upcoming breaking change without creating an overwhelming amount of console noise.\n\nIf you run Sass in verbose mode instead, it will print _every_ deprecation warning it encounters. This can be useful for tracking the remaining work to be done when fixing deprecations. You can enable verbose mode using the [`--verbose` flag](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass/#verbose) on the command line, or the [`verbose` option](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/interfaces/Options/#verbose) in the JavaScript API.\n\n## Heads up!\n\nWhen running from the [JSAPI](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/), Sass doesn’t share any information across compilations, so by default it’ll print five warnings for _each stylesheet_ that’s compiled.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what @each is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain @each in sass.\n\n# @each\n\nThe `@each` rule makes it easy to emit styles or evaluate code for each element of a list or each pair in a map. It’s great for repetitive styles that only have a few variations between them.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n$sizes: 40px, 50px, 80px;\n\n@each $size in $sizes {\n  .icon-#{$size} {\n    font-size: $size;\n    height: $size;\n    width: $size;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n$sizes: 40px, 50px, 80px\n\n@each $size in $sizes\n  .icon-#{$size}\n    font-size: $size\n    height: $size\n    width: $size\n```\n\n## CSS Output\n\n```css\n.icon-40px {\n  font-size: 40px;\n  height: 40px;\n  width: 40px;\n}\n\n.icon-50px {\n  font-size: 50px;\n  height: 50px;\n  width: 50px;\n}\n\n.icon-80px {\n  font-size: 80px;\n  height: 80px;\n  width: 80px;\n}\n```\n\n## With Maps\n\nYou can also use `@each` to iterate over every key/value pair in a map by writing it `@each <variable>, <variable> in <expression> { ... }`. The key is assigned to the first variable name, and the element is assigned to the second.\n\n## SCSS Syntax (With Maps)\n\n```scss\n$icons: (\"eye\": \"\\f112\", \"start\": \"\\f12e\", \"stop\": \"\\f12f\");\n\n@each $name, $glyph in $icons {\n  .icon-#{$name}:before {\n    display: inline-block;\n    font-family: \"Icon Font\";\n    content: $glyph;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax (With Maps)\n\n```sass\n$icons: (\"eye\": \"\\f112\", \"start\": \"\\f12e\", \"stop\": \"\\f12f\")\n\n@each $name, $glyph in $icons\n  .icon-#{$name}:before\n    display: inline-block\n    font-family: \"Icon Font\"\n    content: $glyph\n```\n\n## CSS Output (With Maps)\n\n```css\n.icon-eye:before {\n  display: inline-block;\n  font-family: \"Icon Font\";\n  content: \"\\f112\";\n}\n\n.icon-start:before {\n  display: inline-block;\n  font-family: \"Icon Font\";\n  content: \"\\f12e\";\n}\n\n.icon-stop:before {\n  display: inline-block;\n  font-family: \"Icon Font\";\n  content: \"\\f12f\";\n}\n```\n\n## Destructuring\n\nIf you have a list of lists, you can use `@each` to automatically assign variables to each of the values from the inner lists by writing it `@each <variable...> in <expression> { ... }`. This is known as _destructuring_, since the variables match the structure of the inner lists.\n\n## SCSS Syntax (Destructuring)\n\n```scss\n$icons:\n  \"eye\" \"\\f112\" 12px,\n  \"start\" \"\\f12e\" 16px,\n  \"stop\" \"\\f12f\" 10px;\n\n@each $name, $glyph, $size in $icons {\n  .icon-#{$name}:before {\n    display: inline-block;\n    font-family: \"Icon Font\";\n    content: $glyph;\n    font-size: $size;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax (Destructuring)\n\n```sass\n$icons: \"eye\" \"\\f112\" 12px, \"start\" \"\\f12e\" 16px, \"stop\" \"\\f12f\" 10px\n\n@each $name, $glyph, $size in $icons\n  .icon-#{$name}:before\n    display: inline-block\n    font-family: \"Icon Font\"\n    content: $glyph\n    font-size: $size\n```\n\n## CSS Output (Destructuring)\n\n```css\n.icon-eye:before {\n  display: inline-block;\n  font-family: \"Icon Font\";\n  content: \"\\f112\";\n  font-size: 12px;\n}\n\n.icon-start:before {\n  display: inline-block;\n  font-family: \"Icon Font\";\n  content: \"\\f12e\";\n  font-size: 16px;\n}\n\n.icon-stop:before {\n  display: inline-block;\n  font-family: \"Icon Font\";\n  content: \"\\f12f\";\n  font-size: 10px;\n}\n```\n\n## Fun fact\n\nBecause `@each` supports destructuring and maps count as lists of lists, `@each`’s map support works without needing special support for maps in particular.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/control/each", "title": "@each", "description": "The `@each` rule makes it easy to emit styles or evaluate code for each element of a list or each pair in a map.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Breaking Change: MixedDeclarations is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Breaking Change: MixedDeclarations in sass.\n\n# Breaking Change: MixedDeclarations\n\nCSS is changing the way it handles declarations mixed with nested rules, and we want to make sure Sass matches its behavior.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## The Story So Far\n\nHistorically, if you mixed together nested rules and declarations in Sass, it would pull all the declarations to the beginning of the rule to avoid duplicating the outer selector more than necessary. For example:\n\n- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/mixed-decls/#example-mixed-declarations-old-scss)\n- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/mixed-decls/#example-mixed-declarations-old-sass)\n- [CSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/mixed-decls/#example-mixed-declarations-old-css)\n\nWhen plain CSS Nesting was first introduced, it behaved the same way. However, after some consideration, the CSS working group decided it made more sense to make the declarations apply in the order they appeared in the document.\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n.example {\n  color: red;\n\n  a {\n    font-weight: bold;\n  }\n\n  font-weight: normal;\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n.example\n  color: red\n\n  a\n    font-weight: bold\n\n  font-weight: normal\n```\n\n## CSS Output\n\n```css\n.example {\n  color: red;\n  font-weight: normal;\n}\n\n.example a {\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n```\n\n## Deprecating the Old Way\n\nThe use of declarations _after_ nested rules is currently deprecated in Sass, in order to notify users of the upcoming change and give them time to make their stylesheets compatible with it. In a future release, Dart Sass will change to match the ordering produced by plain CSS nesting.\n\n## SCSS Syntax (Opt-in)\n\n```scss\n.example {\n  color: red;\n\n  a {\n    font-weight: bold;\n  }\n\n  & {\n    font-weight: normal;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax (Opt-in)\n\n```sass\n.example\n  color: red\n\n  a\n    font-weight: bold\n\n  &\n    font-weight: normal\n```\n\n## CSS Output (Opt-in)\n\n```css\n.example {\n  color: red;\n}\n.example a {\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n.example {\n  font-weight: normal;\n}\n```\n\n## Can I Silence the Warnings?\n\nSass provides a powerful suite of options for managing which deprecation warnings you see and when.\n\n## Terse and Verbose Mode\n\nBy default, Sass runs in terse mode, where it will only print each type of deprecation warning five times before it silences additional warnings. If you run Sass in verbose mode instead, it will print _every_ deprecation warning it encounters.\n\n## ⚠️ Heads up!\n\nWhen running from the JSAPI, Sass doesn’t share any information across compilations, so by default it’ll print five warnings for _each stylesheet_ that’s compiled.\n\n## Silencing Deprecations in Dependencies\n\nSometimes, your dependencies have deprecation warnings that you can’t do anything about. You can silence deprecation warnings from dependencies while still printing them for your app.\n\n## Silencing Specific Deprecations\n\nIf you know that one particular deprecation isn’t a problem for you, you can silence warnings for that specific deprecation.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/mixed-decls", "title": "Breaking Change: MixedDeclarations", "description": "CSS is changing the way it handles declarations mixed with nested rules, and we want to make sure Sass matches its behavior.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 13, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 00:15:46", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"title": "Sass: Breaking Change: Mixed Declarations", "favicon": "https://sass-lang.com/icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "language": "en", "description": "Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets", "scrapeId": "02d30d1d-cf11-4f6b-a176-3af9d8ff2313", "sourceURL": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/mixed-decls", "url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/mixed-decls/", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Breaking Change: Null AlphaChannel is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Breaking Change: Null AlphaChannel in sass.\n\n# Breaking Change: Null AlphaChannel\n\nThis page discusses the breaking change in Dart Sass 1.64.3 regarding the handling of null values in the SassColor constructor, particularly for the alpha channel.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Overview\n\nPrior to Dart Sass 1.64.3, in the JS and Dart APIs, if `null` was passed to the `SassColor` constructor it would be treated as 1. This is now deprecated. Users should explicitly pass 1 or `undefined` instead.\n\n## CSS Color Module Level 4 Support\n\nSass is working on adding support for the CSS Color Module Level 4. One of the changes in this module is the idea of 'missing components': if a color component like `alpha` is missing, it’s mostly treated as 0, but if it’s interpolated with another color (such as in a gradient or an animation) it will automatically take on the other color’s value.\n\n## Handling Missing Channels\n\nWe need a way for users of the JS and Dart APIs to access and set missing channels, and `null` is the most natural way to do that. In most cases, this isn’t an issue; callers who intend to create opaque colors usually just leave out the `alpha` parameter anyway (or pass `undefined` in JS). But if callers are explicitly passing `null`, that will eventually be treated as a transparent color instead of an opaque one.\n\n## Preserving Current Behavior\n\nTo preserve the current behavior, all you need to do is explicitly pass 1 if `alpha` is unset.\n\n## Code Examples\n\nIn JS:\n```js\nnew sass.SassColor({\n  red: 102,\n  green: 51,\n  blue: 153,\n  alpha: alpha ?? 1,\n});\n```\nAnd in Dart:\n```dart\nsass.SassColor.rgb(102, 51, 153, alpha ?? 1);\n```\n\n## Fun Fact\n\nThe TypeScript types for the Sass API already forbid passing `null` as `alpha`; it’s only allowed to be absent, `undefined`, or a `Number`. But prior to Dart Sass 1.64.3, if you weren’t using TypeScript and you _did_ pass `null` it would still be treated as an opaque color.\n\n## Transition Period\n\nBetween Dart Sass 1.64.3 and the upcoming release of support for CSS Colors Level 4, Dart Sass will continue to interpret a `null` `alpha` value as an opaque color. However, it will emit a deprecation warning to encourage authors to explicitly pass `alpha` 1 instead.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nDart Sass since 1.64.3\nLibSass✗\nRuby Sass✗\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/null-alpha", "title": "Breaking Change: Null AlphaChannel", "description": "This page discusses the breaking change in Dart Sass 1.64.3 regarding the handling of null values in the SassColor constructor, particularly for the alpha channel.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 8, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 00:21:06", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"title": "Sass: Breaking Change: Null Alpha Channel", "favicon": "https://sass-lang.com/icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets", "language": "en", "scrapeId": "e618d2ce-064c-4e94-b209-ee4f8ded26c2", "sourceURL": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/null-alpha", "url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/null-alpha/", "statusCode": 200}}}

This helps ensure that users know when they need to be aware of an upcoming breaking change without creating an overwhelming amount of console noise.\n\nIf you run Sass in verbose mode instead, it will print _every_ deprecation warning it encounters. This can be useful for tracking the remaining work to be done when fixing deprecations. You can enable verbose mode using the [`--verbose` flag](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass/#verbose) on the command line, or the [`verbose` option](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/interfaces/Options/#verbose) in the JavaScript API.\n\n## Heads up!\n\nWhen running from the [JSAPI](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/), Sass doesn’t share any information across compilations, so by default it’ll print five warnings for _each stylesheet_ that’s compiled. However, you can fix this by writing (or asking the author of your favorite framework’s Sass plugin to write) a [custom `Logger`](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/interfaces/Logger-1/) that only prints five errors per deprecation and can be shared across multiple compilations.\n\n## Silencing Deprecations in Dependencies\n\nSometimes, your dependencies have deprecation warnings that you can’t do anything about. You can silence deprecation warnings from dependencies while still printing them for your app using the [`--quiet-deps` flag](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass/#quiet-deps) on the command line, or the [`quietDeps` option](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/interfaces/Options/#quietDeps) in the JavaScript API.\n\n## Silencing Specific Deprecations\n\nIf you know that one particular deprecation isn’t a problem for you, you can silence warnings for that specific deprecation using the [`--silence-deprecation` flag](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass/#silence-deprecation) on the command line, or the [`silenceDeprecations` option](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/interfaces/Options/#silenceDeprecations) in the JavaScript API.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/strict-unary", "title": "Breaking Change: Strict UnaryOperators", "description": "Sass has historically allowed `-` and `+` to be used in ways that make it ambiguous whether the author intended them to be a binary or unary operator.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Breaking Change: Functions and Mixins Beginning with– is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Breaking Change: Functions and Mixins Beginning with– in sass.\n\n# Breaking Change: Functions and Mixins Beginning with–\n\nThis page discusses the deprecation of function and mixin names beginning with `--` in Dart Sass 1.76.0 and the transition period for compatibility.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Transition Period\n\nCompatibility:\n\nDart Sass since 1.76.0\n\nLibSass✗\n\nRuby Sass✗\n\nBetween Dart Sass 1.76.0 and Dart Sass 2.0.0, Dart Sass will continue to allow functions and mixins whose names begin with `--`. However, it will emit a deprecation warning named `css-function-mixin`.\n\nBetween Dart Sass 2.0.0 and the release of Dart Sass’s support for plain CSS functions and mixins, functions and mixins will not be allowed to have names that begin with `--`.\n\n## Can I Silence the Warnings?\n\nSass provides a powerful suite of options for managing which deprecation warnings you see and when.\n\n## Terse and Verbose Mode\n\nBy default, Sass runs in terse mode, where it will only print each type of deprecation warning five times before it silences additional warnings. This helps ensure that users know when they need to be aware of an upcoming breaking change without creating an overwhelming amount of console noise.\n\nIf you run Sass in verbose mode instead, it will print _every_ deprecation warning it encounters. This can be useful for tracking the remaining work to be done when fixing deprecations. You can enable verbose mode using the [`--verbose` flag](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass/#verbose) on the command line, or the [`verbose` option](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/interfaces/Options/#verbose) in the JavaScript API.\n\n## Heads up!\n\nWhen running from the [JSAPI](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/), Sass doesn’t share any information across compilations, so by default it’ll print five warnings for _each stylesheet_ that’s compiled. However, you can fix this by writing (or asking the author of your favorite framework’s Sass plugin to write) a [custom `Logger`](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/interfaces/Logger-1/) that only prints five errors per deprecation and can be shared across multiple compilations.\n\n## Silencing Deprecations in Dependencies\n\nSometimes, your dependencies have deprecation warnings that you can’t do anything about. You can silence deprecation warnings from dependencies while still printing them for your app using the [`--quiet-deps` flag](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass/#quiet-deps) on the command line, or the [`quietDeps` option](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/interfaces/Options/#quietDeps) in the JavaScript API.\n\nFor the purposes of this flag, a \"dependency\" is any stylesheet that’s not just a series of relative loads from the entrypoint stylesheet. This means anything that comes from a load path, and most stylesheets loaded through custom importers.\n\n## Silencing Specific Deprecations\n\nIf you know that one particular deprecation isn’t a problem for you, you can silence warnings for that specific deprecation using the [`--silence-deprecation` flag](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass/#silence-deprecation) on the command line, or the [`silenceDeprecations` option](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/interfaces/Options/#silenceDeprecations) in the JavaScript API.\n\n## Current Releases\n\n- [Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass) [1.85.1](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases/tag/1.85.1)\n- [LibSass](https://sass-lang.com/libsass) [3.6.6](https://github.com/sass/libsass/releases/tag/3.6.6)\n- [Ruby Sass](https://sass-lang.com/ruby-sass) ⚰\n- [Implementation Guide](https://sass-lang.com/implementation)\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/css-function-mixin", "title": "Breaking Change: Functions and Mixins Beginning with–", "description": "This page discusses the deprecation of function and mixin names beginning with `--` in Dart Sass 1.76.0 and the transition period for compatibility.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 7, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 00:48:13", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"description": "Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "favicon": "https://sass-lang.com/icon.png", "title": "Sass: Breaking Change: Functions and Mixins Beginning with --", "language": "en", "scrapeId": "92bbf9dd-7b62-4c72-a03b-8149861112b2", "sourceURL": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/css-function-mixin", "url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/css-function-mixin/", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Breaking Change: Duplicate VariableFlags is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Breaking Change: Duplicate VariableFlags in sass.\n\n# Breaking Change: Duplicate VariableFlags\n\nVariables will only allow a single `!global` or `!default` flag. Duplicate flags never had any additional effect, this just ensures that stylesheets are more consistent.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Phase 1\n\nCompatibility:\n\nDart Sass since 2.0.0\n\nLibSass ✗\n\nRuby Sass ✗\n\nStarting in Dart Sass 2.0.0, if a single variable declaration has more than one each `!global` or `!default` flag, this will be a syntax error. This means that `$var: value !default !default` will be forbidden. `$var: value !global !default` will still be allowed.\n\n## Transition Period\n\nCompatibility:\n\nDart Sass since 1.62.0\n\nLibSass ✗\n\nRuby Sass ✗\n\nUntil Dart Sass 2.0.0 is released, multiple copies of a flag just produce deprecation warnings.\n\n## Can I Silence the Warnings?\n\nSass provides a powerful suite of options for managing which deprecation warnings you see and when.\n\n## Terse and Verbose Mode\n\nBy default, Sass runs in terse mode, where it will only print each type of deprecation warning five times before it silences additional warnings. This helps ensure that users know when they need to be aware of an upcoming breaking change without creating an overwhelming amount of console noise.\n\nIf you run Sass in verbose mode instead, it will print _every_ deprecation warning it encounters. This can be useful for tracking the remaining work to be done when fixing deprecations. You can enable verbose mode using the [`--verbose` flag](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass/#verbose) on the command line, or the [`verbose` option](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/interfaces/Options/#verbose) in the JavaScript API.\n\n## ⚠️ Heads up!\n\nWhen running from the [JSAPI](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/), Sass doesn’t share any information across compilations, so by default it’ll print five warnings for _each stylesheet_ that’s compiled. However, you can fix this by writing (or asking the author of your favorite framework’s Sass plugin to write) a [custom `Logger`](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/interfaces/Logger-1/) that only prints five errors per deprecation and can be shared across multiple compilations.\n\n## Silencing Deprecations in Dependencies\n\nSometimes, your dependencies have deprecation warnings that you can’t do anything about. You can silence deprecation warnings from dependencies while still printing them for your app using the [`--quiet-deps` flag](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass/#quiet-deps) on the command line, or the [`quietDeps` option](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/interfaces/Options/#quietDeps) in the JavaScript API.\n\nFor the purposes of this flag, a \"dependency\" is any stylesheet that’s not just a series of relative loads from the entrypoint stylesheet. This means anything that comes from a load path, and most stylesheets loaded through custom importers.\n\n## Silencing Specific Deprecations\n\nIf you know that one particular deprecation isn’t a problem for you, you can silence warnings for that specific deprecation using the [`--silence-deprecation` flag](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass/#silence-deprecation) on the command line, or the [`silenceDeprecations` option](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/interfaces/Options/#silenceDeprecations) in the JavaScript API.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/duplicate-var-flags", "title": "Breaking Change: Duplicate VariableFlags", "description": "Variables will only allow a single `!global` or `!default` flag.

This helps ensure that users know when they need to be aware of an upcoming breaking change without creating an overwhelming amount of console noise.\n\nIf you run Sass in verbose mode instead, it will print _every_ deprecation warning it encounters. This can be useful for tracking the remaining work to be done when fixing deprecations. You can enable verbose mode using the [`--verbose` flag](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass/#verbose) on the command line, or the [`verbose` option](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/interfaces/Options/#verbose) in the JavaScript API..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/duplicate-var-flags", "title": "Breaking Change: Duplicate VariableFlags", "description": "Variables will only allow a single `!global` or `!default` flag.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Breaking Change: Color JSAPI is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Breaking Change: Color JSAPI in sass.\n\n# Breaking Change: Color JSAPI\n\nThis page discusses the breaking changes in the JS color API due to the support for CSS Color 4 in Sass, including deprecated methods and new requirements for color manipulation.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## color.change() now requires a space for cross-space changes\n\nPreviously, the color.change() method just took a set of channel names from the RGB, HSL, or HWB spaces. As long as those channels weren’t mixed across spaces (for example by changing both red and hue at the same time), Sass could figure out which space was intended.\n\nWith Color 4, color spaces are no longer unambiguous from their channel names alone. Many spaces have red, green, and blue channels with different ranges; many spaces have hue channels which produce very different color wheels. To fix this ambiguity, color.change() now takes a space parameter which explicitly specifies the name of the color space you want to do the transformation in:\n\n```js\nconst color = new sass.SassColor({red: 0x66, green: 0x33, blue: 0x99});\ncolor.change({hue: 270, space: \"okclh\"});\n```\n\nSpecifying the color space is mandatory if the color in question isn’t in a legacy color space or if you’re changing a channel like chroma that only exists in non-legacy color spaces. It’s always optional if you’re changing a channel that exists in the color’s own space, so color.change({red: 0.8}) always refers to the native red channel of any color with red, green, and blue channels.\n\nFor backwards-compatibility, if you’re changing legacy channels for a legacy color, Sass will still automatically convert the color for you. However, this behavior is deprecated. To be safe, you should always pass the space parameter unless you’re sure the color is already in the color space whose channel you want to change.\n\n## null channel values\n\nOne of the major changes in CSS Color 4 is the new concept of \"missing\" channels. For example, hsl(none 0% 40%) has a missing hue, which is treated as 0 in most cases but doesn’t contribute to color interpolation so that a gradient with this color won’t have a phantom red hue in the middle. When constructing colors, Sass represents missing values as the value null.\n\nBefore adding support for CSS Color 4, the Sass JSAPI’s TypeScript types forbade the use of null in all places where it was relevant. However, the code itself treated null the same as undefined, and we don’t want to break compatibility with any plain JavaScript code that was relying on this behavior. For now, a null value is treated as undefined and emits a deprecation warning when constructing a new legacy color or calling color.change() for a legacy color. In either case, if you pass a space parameter explicitly, you’ll opt into the new behavior and null will be treated as a missing channel.\n\n## Transition Period\n\nCompatibility:\n\n- Dart Sass since 1.79.0\n- LibSass ✗\n- Ruby Sass ✗\n\nFirst, we’ll emit deprecation warnings for all uses of these APIs that are slated to be changed. In Dart Sass 2.0.0, the breaking changes will go into effect fully, and the old behavior will no longer work how it used to.\n\n## Can I Silence the Warnings?\n\nSass provides a powerful suite of options for managing which deprecation warnings you see and when.\n\n## Terse and Verbose Mode\n\nBy default, Sass runs in terse mode, where it will only print each type of deprecation warning five times before it silences additional warnings. This helps ensure that users know when they need to be aware of an upcoming breaking change without creating an overwhelming amount of console noise.\n\nIf you run Sass in verbose mode instead, it will print every deprecation warning it encounters. This can be useful for tracking the remaining work to be done when fixing deprecations. You can enable verbose mode using the verbose option in the JavaScript API.\n\n## Heads up!\n\nWhen running from the JSAPI, Sass doesn’t share any information across compilations, so by default it’ll print five warnings for each stylesheet that’s compiled. However, you can fix this by writing (or asking the author of your favorite framework’s Sass plugin to write) a custom Logger that only prints five errors per deprecation and can be shared across multiple compilations.\n\n## Silencing Deprecations in Dependencies\n\nSometimes, your dependencies have deprecation warnings that you can’t do anything about. You can silence deprecation warnings from dependencies while still printing them for your app using the quietDeps option in the JavaScript API.\n\n## Silencing Specific Deprecations\n\nIf you know that one particular deprecation isn’t a problem for you, you can silence warnings for that specific deprecation using the silenceDeprecations option in the JavaScript API.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/color-4-api", "title": "Breaking Change: Color JSAPI", "description": "This page discusses the breaking changes in the JS color API due to the support for CSS Color 4 in Sass, including deprecated methods and new requirements for color manipulation.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 8, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 00:52:38", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"favicon": "https://sass-lang.com/icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "language": "en", "title": "Sass: Breaking Change: Color JS API", "description": "Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets", "scrapeId": "3d31b0e8-d1b4-4717-ad44-51852014fbf0", "sourceURL": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/color-4-api", "url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/color-4-api/", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Breaking Change: Legacy JSAPI is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Breaking Change: Legacy JSAPI in sass.\n\n# Breaking Change: Legacy JSAPI\n\nDart Sass originally used an API based on the one used by Node Sass, but replaced it with a new, modern API in Dart Sass 1.45.0. The legacy JSAPI is now deprecated and will be removed in Dart Sass 2.0.0.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Migrating Usage\n\nThe legacy JSAPI had two entrypoints for compiling Sass: `render` and `renderSync`, which took in an options object that included either `file` (to compile a file) or `data` (to compile a string). The modern API has four: `compile` and `compileAsync` for compiling a file and `compileString` and `compileStringAsync` for compiling a string. These functions take a path or source string as their first argument and then an object of all other options as their second argument. Unlike `render`, which used a callback, `compileAsync` and `compileStringAsync` return a promise instead.\n\n## Entrypoints\n\nSee the [usage documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/#md:usage) for more details.\n\n## Importers\n\nImporters in the legacy API consisted of a single function that took in the dependency rule URL and the URL of the containing stylesheet (as well as a `done` callback for asynchronous importers) and return an object with either a `file` path on disk or the `contents` of the stylesheet to be loaded.\n\nModern API [`Importer`](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/interfaces/Importer/)s instead contain two methods: `canonicalize`, which takes in a rule URL and returns the canonical form of that URL; and `load`, which takes in a canonical URL and returns an object with the contents of the loaded stylesheet. This split ensures that the same module is only loaded once and that relative URLs work consistently. Asynchronous importers have both of these methods return promises.\n\nThere’s also a special [`FileImporter`](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/interfaces/FileImporter/) that redirects all loads to existing files on disk, which should be used when migrating from legacy importers that returned a `file` instead of `contents`.\n\n## Custom Functions\n\nIn the legacy JSAPI, custom functions took a separate JS argument for each Sass argument, with an additional `done` callback for asynchronous custom functions. In the modern API, custom functions instead take a single JS argument that contains a list of all Sass arguments, with asynchronous custom functions returning a promise.\n\nThe modern API also uses a much more robust [`Value`](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/classes/Value/) class that supports all Sass value types, type assertions, and easy map and list lookups.\n\n## Bundlers\n\nIf you’re using a bundler or other tool that calls the Sass API rather than using it directly, you may need to change the configuration you pass to that tool to tell it to use the modern API.\n\nWebpack should already use the modern API by default, but if you’re getting warnings, set `api` to `\"modern\"` or `\"modern-compiler\"`.\nSee [Webpack’s documentation](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/sass-loader/#api) for more details.\n\nVite 6 uses the modern API by default. Previous versions of Vite still use the legacy API, however from Vite 5.4 you can switch it by setting `api` to `\"modern\"` or `\"modern-compiler\"`. See [Vite’s documentation](https://vitejs.dev/config/shared-options.html#css-preprocessoroptions) for more details.\n\nFor other tools, check their documentation or issue tracker for information about supporting the modern Sass API.\n\n## Silencing Warnings\n\nWhile the legacy JSAPI was marked as deprecated in Dart Sass 1.45.0 alongside the release of the modern API, we began emitting warnings for using it starting in Dart Sass 1.79.0. If you’re not yet able to migrate to the modern API but want to silence the warnings for now, you can pass `legacy-js-api` in the `silenceDeprecations` option:\n\n```js\nconst sass = require('sass');\n\nconst result = sass.renderSync({\n  silenceDeprecations: ['legacy-js-api'],\n  ...\n});\n```\n\nThis will silence the warnings for now, but the legacy API will be removed entirely in Dart Sass 2.0.0, so you should still plan to migrate off of it soon.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/breaking-changes/legacy-js-api", "title": "Breaking Change: Legacy JSAPI", "description": "Dart Sass originally used an API based on the one used by Node Sass, but replaced it with a new, modern API in Dart Sass 1.45.0.

The modern API has four: `compile` and `compileAsync` for compiling a file and `compileString` and `compileStringAsync` for compiling a string. These functions take a path or source string as their first argument and then an object of all other options as their second argument.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Built-In Modules is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Built-In Modules in sass.\n\n# Built-In Modules\n\nThis page covers the built-in modules available in Sass, their compatibility, and how to use them with examples.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Compatibility\n\nDart Sass since 1.23.0\nLibSass ✗\nRuby Sass ✗\n\nOnly Dart Sass currently supports loading built-in modules with `@use`. Users of other implementations must call functions using their global names instead.\n\n## Heads up!\n\nBefore the Sass module system was introduced, all Sass functions were globally available at all times. Many functions still have global aliases (these are listed in their documentation). The Sass team discourages their use and will eventually deprecate them, but for now they remain available for compatibility with older Sass versions and with LibSass (which doesn’t support the module system yet).\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@use \"sass:color\";\n\n.button {\n  $primary-color: #6b717f;\n  color: $primary-color;\n  border: 1px solid color.scale($primary-color, $lightness: 20%);\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@use \"sass:color\"\n\n.button\n  $primary-color: #6b717f\n  color: $primary-color\n  border: 1px solid color.scale($primary-color, $lightness: 20%)\n```\n\n## CSS Output\n\n```css\n.button {\n  color: #6b717f;\n  border: 1px solid rgb(135.1641025641, 140.8256410256, 154.0358974359);\n}\n```\n\n## Built-in Modules\n\nSass provides the following built-in modules:\n\n- The [`sass:math` module](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/math) provides functions that operate on [numbers](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/numbers).\n- The [`sass:string` module](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/string) makes it easy to combine, search, or split apart [strings](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/strings).\n- The [`sass:color` module](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/color) generates new [colors](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/colors) based on existing ones, making it easy to build color themes.\n- The [`sass:list` module](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/list) lets you access and modify values in [lists](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/lists).\n- The [`sass:map` module](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/map) makes it possible to look up the value associated with a key in a [map](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/maps), and much more.\n- The [`sass:selector` module](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/selector) provides access to Sass’s powerful selector engine.\n- The [`sass:meta` module](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/meta) exposes the details of Sass’s inner workings.\n\n## Global Functions\n\n### 💡 Fun fact:\n\nYou can pass [special functions](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax/special-functions) like `calc()` or `var()` in place of any argument to a global color constructor.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Numbers is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Numbers in sass.\n\n# Numbers\n\nNumbers in Sass have two components: the number itself, and its units. For example, in `16px` the number is `16` and the unit is `px`. Numbers can have no units, and they can have complex units.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@debug 100; // 100\n@debug 0.8; // 0.8\n@debug 16px; // 16px\n@debug 5px * 2px; // 10px*px (read \"square pixels\")\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@debug 100  // 100\n@debug 0.8  // 0.8\n@debug 16px  // 16px\n@debug 5px * 2px  // 10px*px (read \"square pixels\")\n```\n\n## Scientific Notation\n\nSass numbers support the same formats as CSS numbers, including [scientific notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation), which is written with an `e` between the number and its power of 10. Because support for scientific notation in browsers has historically been spotty, Sass always compiles it to fully expanded numbers.\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@debug 5.2e3; // 5200\n@debug 6e-2; // 0.06\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@debug 5.2e3  // 5200\n@debug 6e-2  // 0.06\n```\n\n## Heads up!\n\nSass doesn’t distinguish between whole numbers and decimals, so for example `math.div(5, 2)` returns `2.5` rather than `2`. This is the same behavior as JavaScript, but different than many other programming languages.\n\n## Units\n\nSass has powerful support for manipulating units based on how [real-world unit calculations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_of_measurement#Calculations_with_units_of_measurement) work. When two numbers are multiplied, their units are multiplied as well. When one number is divided by another, the result takes its numerator units from the first number and its denominator units from the second. A number can have any number of units in the numerator and/or denominator.\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@use 'sass:math';\n\n@debug 4px * 6px; // 24px*px (read \"square pixels\")\n@debug math.div(5px, 2s); // 2.5px/s (read \"pixels per second\")\n\n// 3.125px*deg/s*em (read \"pixel-degrees per second-em\")\n@debug 5px * math.div(math.div(30deg, 2s), 24em);\n\n$degrees-per-second: math.div(20deg, 1s);\n@debug $degrees-per-second; // 20deg/s\n@debug math.div(1, $degrees-per-second); // 0.05s/deg\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@use 'sass:math'\n\n@debug 4px * 6px  // 24px*px (read \"square pixels\")\n@debug math.div(5px, 2s)  // 2.5px/s (read \"pixels per second\")\n\n// 3.125px*deg/s*em (read \"pixel-degrees per second-em\")\n@debug 5px * math.div(math.div(30deg, 2s), 24em)\n\n$degrees-per-second: math.div(20deg, 1s)\n@debug $degrees-per-second  // 20deg/s\n@debug math.div(1, $degrees-per-second)  // 0.05s/deg\n```\n\n## Heads up!\n\nBecause CSS doesn’t support complex units like square pixels, using a number with complex units as a [property value](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/style-rules/declarations) will produce an error. This is a feature in disguise, though; if you aren’t ending up with the right unit, it usually means that something’s wrong with your calculations! And remember, you can always use the [`@debug` rule](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/debug) to check out the units of any variable or [expression](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax/structure#expressions).\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n// CSS defines one inch as 96 pixels.\n@debug 1in + 6px; // 102px or 1.0625in\n\n@debug 1in + 1s;\n//     ^^^^^^^^\n// Error: Incompatible units s and in.\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n// CSS defines one inch as 96 pixels.\n@debug 1in + 6px  // 102px or 1.0625in\n\n@debug 1in + 1s\n//     ^^^^^^^^\n// Error: Incompatible units s and in.\n```\n\n## Transition Example\n\nAs in real-world unit calculations, if the numerator contains units that are compatible with units in the denominator (like `math.div(96px, 1in)`), they’ll cancel out. This makes it easy to define a ratio that you can use for converting between units. In the example below, we set the desired speed to one second per 50 pixels, and then multiply that by the number of pixels the transition covers to get the time it should take.\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@use 'sass:math';\n\n$transition-speed: math.div(1s, 50px);\n\n@mixin move($left-start, $left-stop) {\n  position: absolute;\n  left: $left-start;\n  transition: left ($left-stop - $left-start) * $transition-speed;\n\n  &:hover {\n    left: $left-stop;\n  }\n}\n\n.slider {\n  @include move(10px, 120px);\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@use 'sass:math'\n\n$transition-speed: math.div(1s, 50px)\n\n@mixin move($left-start, $left-stop)\n  position: absolute\n  left: $left-start\n  transition: left ($left-stop - $left-start) * $transition-speed\n\n  &:hover\n    left: $left-stop\n\n.slider\n  @include move(10px, 120px)\n```\n\n## CSS Output\n\n```css\n.slider {\n  position: absolute;\n  left: 10px;\n  transition: left 2.2s;\n}\n.slider:hover {\n  left: 120px;\n}\n```\n\n## Heads up!\n\nIf your arithmetic gives you the wrong unit, you probably need to check your math. You may be leaving off units for a quantity that should have them! Staying unit-clean allows Sass to give you helpful errors when something isn’t right.\n\n## Heads up!\n\nYou should especially avoid using interpolation like `#{$number}px`. This doesn’t actually create a number! It creates an [unquoted string](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/strings#unquoted) that _looks_ like a number, but won’t work with any [number operations](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/operators/numeric) or [functions](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/math). Try to make your math unit-clean so that `$number` already has the unit `px`, or write `$number * 1px`.\n\n## Heads up!\n\nPercentages in Sass work just like every other unit. They are _not_ interchangeable with decimals, because in CSS decimals and percentages mean different things. For example, `50%` is a number with `%` as its unit, and Sass considers it different than the number `0.5`. You can convert between decimals and percentages using unit arithmetic. `math.div($percentage, 100%)` will return the corresponding decimal, and `$decimal * 100%` will return the corresponding percentage. You can also use the [`math.percentage()` function](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/math#percentage) as a more explicit way of writing `$decimal * 100%`.\n\n## Precision\n\nCompatibility (10 Digit Default):\n\nDart Sass✓\nLibSass✗\nRuby Sass since 3.5.0\n\nLibSass and older versions of Ruby Sass default to 5 digits of numeric precision, but can be configured to use a different number. It’s recommended that users configure them for 10 digits for greater accuracy and forwards-compatibility.\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@debug 0.012345678912345; // 0.0123456789\n@debug 0.01234567891 == 0.01234567899; // true\n@debug 1.00000000009; // 1\n@debug 0.99999999991; // 1\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@debug 0.012345678912345  // 0.0123456789\n@debug 0.01234567891 == 0.01234567899  // true\n@debug 1.00000000009  // 1\n@debug 0.99999999991  // 1\n```\n\n## Fun fact\n\nNumbers are rounded to 10 digits of precision _lazily_ when they’re used in a place where precision is relevant. This means that math functions will work with the full number value internally to avoid accumulating extra rounding errors.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/numbers", "title": "Numbers", "description": "Numbers in Sass have two components: the number itself, and its units.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what sass:list is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain sass:list in sass.\n\n# sass:list\n\nDocumentation for the Sass list module, detailing various functions for manipulating lists in Sass.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Compatibility\n\nDart Sass since 1.23.0\n\nLibSass✗\n\nRuby Sass✗\n\nOnly Dart Sass currently supports loading built-in modules with `@use`. Users of other implementations must call functions using their global names instead.\n\n## Fun fact\n\nIn Sass, every map counts as a list that contains a two-element list for each key/value pair. For example, `(1: 2, 3: 4)` counts as `(1 2, 3 4)`. So all these functions work for maps as well! Individual values also count as lists. All these functions treat `1px` as a list that contains the value `1px.\n\n## list.append\n\nReturns a copy of `$list` with `$val` added to the end. If `$separator` is `comma`, `space`, or `slash`, the returned list is comma-separated, space-separated, or slash-separated, respectively. If it’s `auto` (the default), the returned list will use the same separator as `$list` (or `space` if `$list` doesn’t have a separator). Other values aren’t allowed. Note that unlike `list.join()`, if `$val` is a list it’s nested within the returned list rather than having all its elements added to the returned list.\n\n## SCSS Syntax for list.append\n\n```scss\n@use 'sass:list';\n\n@debug list.append(10px 20px, 30px); // 10px 20px 30px\n@debug list.append((blue, red), green); // blue, red, green\n@debug list.append(10px 20px, 30px 40px); // 10px 20px (30px 40px)\n@debug list.append(10px, 20px, $separator: comma); // 10px, 20px\n@debug list.append((blue, red), green, $separator: space); // blue red green\n```\n\n## list.index\n\nReturns the index of `$value` in `$list`. If `$value` doesn’t appear in `$list`, this returns `null`. If `$value` appears multiple times in `$list`, this returns the index of its first appearance.\n\n## SCSS Syntax for list.index\n\n```scss\n@use 'sass:list';\n\n@debug list.index(1px solid red, 1px); // 1\n@debug list.index(1px solid red, solid); // 2\n@debug list.index(1px solid red, dashed); // null\n```\n\n## list.is-bracketed\n\nReturns whether `$list` has square brackets.\n\n## SCSS Syntax for list.is-bracketed\n\n```scss\n@use 'sass:list';\n\n@debug list.is-bracketed(1px 2px 3px); // false\n@debug list.is-bracketed([1px, 2px, 3px]); // true\n```\n\n## list.join\n\nReturns a new list containing the elements of `$list1` followed by the elements of `$list2`. Because individual values count as single-element lists, it’s possible to use `list.join()` to add a value to the end of a list. However, this is not recommended, since if that value is a list it will be concatenated, which is probably not what you’re expecting. Use `list.append()` instead to add a single value to a list. Only use `list.join()` to combine two lists together into one.\n\n## SCSS Syntax for list.join\n\n```scss\n@use 'sass:list';\n\n@debug list.join(10px 20px, 30px 40px); // 10px 20px 30px 40px\n@debug list.join((blue, red), (#abc, #def)); // blue, red, #abc, #def\n@debug list.join(10px, 20px); // 10px 20px\n@debug list.join(10px, 20px, $separator: comma); // 10px, 20px\n@debug list.join((blue, red), (#abc, #def), $separator: space); // blue red #abc #def\n@debug list.join([10px], 20px); // [10px 20px]\n@debug list.join(10px, 20px, $bracketed: true); // [10px 20px]\n```\n\n## list.length\n\nReturns the length of `$list`. This can also return the number of pairs in a map.\n\n## SCSS Syntax for list.length\n\n```scss\n@use 'sass:list';\n\n@debug list.length(10px); // 1\n@debug list.length(10px 20px 30px); // 3\n@debug list.length((width: 10px, height: 20px)); // 2\n```\n\n## list.separator\n\nReturns the name of the separator used by `$list`, either `space`, `comma`, or `slash`. If `$list` doesn’t have a separator, returns `space`.\n\n## SCSS Syntax for list.separator\n\n```scss\n@use 'sass:list';\n\n@debug list.separator(1px 2px 3px); // space\n@debug list.separator((1px, 2px, 3px)); // comma\n@debug list.separator('Helvetica'); // space\n@debug list.separator(()); // space\n```\n\n## list.nth\n\nReturns the element of `$list` at index `$n`. If `$n` is negative, it counts from the end of `$list`. Throws an error if there is no element at index `$n`.\n\n## SCSS Syntax for list.nth\n\n```scss\n@use 'sass:list';\n\n@debug list.nth(10px 12px 16px, 2); // 12px\n@debug list.nth([line1, line2, line3], -1); // line3\n```\n\n## list.set-nth\n\nReturns a copy of `$list` with the element at index `$n` replaced with `$value`. If `$n` is negative, it counts from the end of `$list`. Throws an error if there is no existing element at index `$n`.\n\n## SCSS Syntax for list.set-nth\n\n```scss\n@use 'sass:list';\n\n@debug list.set-nth(10px 20px 30px, 1, 2em); // 2em 20px 30px\n@debug list.set-nth(10px 20px 30px, -1, 8em); // 10px, 20px, 8em\n@debug list.set-nth((Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif), 3, Roboto); // Helvetica, Arial, Roboto\n```\n\n## list.slash\n\nReturns a slash-separated list that contains `$elements`. This function is a temporary solution for creating slash-separated lists.\n\n## SCSS Syntax for list.slash\n\n```scss\n@use 'sass:list';\n\n@debug list.slash(1px, 50px, 100px); // 1px / 50px / 100px\n```\n\n## list.zip\n\nCombines every list in `$lists` into a single list of sub-lists. Each element in the returned list contains all the elements at that position in `$lists`. The returned list is as long as the shortest list in `$lists`.\n\n## SCSS Syntax for list.zip\n\n```scss\n@use 'sass:list';\n\n@debug list.zip(10px 50px 100px, short mid long); // 10px short, 50px mid, 100px long\n@debug list.zip(10px 50px 100px, short mid); // 10px short, 50px mid\n```\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/list", "title": "sass:list", "description": "Documentation for the Sass list module, detailing various functions for manipulating lists in Sass.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 22, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 01:03:33", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"description": "Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets", "favicon": "https://sass-lang.com/icon.png", "title": "Sass: sass:list", "language": "en", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "scrapeId": "1ad31a05-3af2-4080-9c62-5e12c90b8bc0", "sourceURL": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/list", "url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/list/", "statusCode": 200}}}

Users of other implementations must call functions using their global names instead.\n\n## Fun fact\n\nSass libraries and design systems tend to share and override configurations that are represented as nested maps (maps that contain maps that contain maps). To help you work with nested maps, some map functions support deep operations. For example, if you pass multiple keys to `map.get()`, it will follow those keys to find the desired nested map.\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@use \"sass:map\";\n\n$config: (a: (b: (c: d)));\n@debug map.get($config, a, b, c);

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Maps is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Maps in sass.\n\n# Maps\n\nMaps in Sass hold pairs of keys and values, and make it easy to look up a value by its corresponding key.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Using Maps\n\nSince maps aren’t valid CSS values, they don’t do much of anything on their own. That’s why Sass provides a bunch of functions to create maps and access the values they contain.\n\n## Look Up a Value\n\nMaps are all about associating keys and values, so naturally there’s a way to get the value associated with a key: the `map.get($map, $key)` function! This function returns the value in the map associated with the given key. It returns `null` if the map doesn’t contain the key.\n\n## Do Something for Every Pair\n\nThis doesn’t actually use a function, but it’s still one of the most common ways to use maps. The `@each` rule evaluates a block of styles for each key/value pair in a map. The key and the value are assigned to variables so they can easily be accessed in the block.\n\n## Add to a Map\n\nIt’s also useful to add new pairs to a map, or to replace the value for an existing key. The `map.set($map, $key, $value)` function does this: it returns a copy of `$map` with the value at `$key` set to `$value.\n\n## Immutability\n\nMaps in Sass are immutable, which means that the contents of a map value never changes. Sass’s map functions all return new maps rather than modifying the originals. Immutability helps avoid lots of sneaky bugs that can creep in when the same map is shared across different parts of the stylesheet.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/maps", "title": "Maps", "description": "Maps in Sass hold pairs of keys and values, and make it easy to look up a value by its corresponding key.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 5, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 01:08:15", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"description": "Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets", "favicon": "https://sass-lang.com/icon.png", "language": "en", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "title": "Sass: Maps", "scrapeId": "56af79de-c0fc-4b65-af3a-03f522822c6c", "sourceURL": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/maps", "url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/maps/", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what sass:selector is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain sass:selector in sass.\n\n# sass:selector\n\nThis documentation page covers the Sass selector module, detailing its functions and usage for manipulating selectors in Sass.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Compatibility\n\nDart Sass since 1.23.0\n\nLibSass ✗\n\nRuby Sass ✗\n\nOnly Dart Sass currently supports loading built-in modules with `@use`. Users of other implementations must call functions using their global names instead.\n\n## Selector Values\n\nThe functions in this module inspect and manipulate selectors. Whenever they return a selector, it’s always a comma-separated list (the selector list) that contains space-separated lists (the complex selectors) that contain unquoted strings (the compound selectors). For example, the selector `.main aside:hover, .sidebar p` would be returned as:\n\n```scss\n@debug ((unquote(\".main\") unquote(\"aside:hover\")),\n        (unquote(\".sidebar\") unquote(\"p\")));\n// .main aside:hover, .sidebar p\n```\n\nSelector arguments to these functions may be in the same format, but they can also just be normal strings (quoted or unquoted), or a combination. For example, `\".main aside:hover, .sidebar p\"` is a valid selector argument.\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@use \"sass:selector\";\n\n@debug selector.is-superselector(\"a\", \"a.disabled\"); // true\n@debug selector.is-superselector(\"a.disabled\", \"a\"); // false\n@debug selector.is-superselector(\"a\", \"sidebar a\"); // true\n@debug selector.is-superselector(\"sidebar a\", \"a\"); // false\n@debug selector.is-superselector(\"a\", \"a\"); // true\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@use \"sass:selector\"\n\n@debug selector.is-superselector(\"a\", \"a.disabled\")  // true\n@debug selector.is-superselector(\"a.disabled\", \"a\")  // false\n@debug selector.is-superselector(\"a\", \"sidebar a\")  // true\n@debug selector.is-superselector(\"sidebar a\", \"a\")  // false\n@debug selector.is-superselector(\"a\", \"a\")  // true\n```\n\n## selector.append\n\nCombines `$selectors` without descendant combinators—that is, without whitespace between them.\n\nIf any selector in `$selectors` is a selector list, each complex selector is combined separately.\n\nThe `$selectors` may contain placeholder selectors, but not parent selectors.\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@use \"sass:selector\";\n\n@debug selector.append(\"a\", \".disabled\"); // a.disabled\n@debug selector.append(\".accordion\", \"__copy\"); // .accordion__copy\n@debug selector.append(\".accordion\", \"__copy, __image\");\n// .accordion__copy, .accordion__image\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@use \"sass:selector\"\n\n@debug selector.append(\"a\", \".disabled\")  // a.disabled\n@debug selector.append(\".accordion\", \"__copy\")  // .accordion__copy\n@debug selector.append(\".accordion\", \"__copy, __image\")\n// .accordion__copy, .accordion__image\n```\n\n## selector.extend\n\nExtends `$selector` as with the `@extend` rule.\n\nReturns a copy of `$selector` modified with the following `@extend` rule:\n\n```scss\n#{$extender} {\n  @extend #{$extendee};\n}\n```\n\nIn other words, replaces all instances of `$extendee` in `$selector` with `$extendee, $extender`. If `$selector` doesn’t contain `$extendee`, returns it as-is.\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@use \"sass:selector\";\n\n@debug selector.extend(\"a.disabled\", \"a\", \".link\"); // a.disabled, .link.disabled\n@debug selector.extend(\"a.disabled\", \"h1\", \"h2\"); // a.disabled\n@debug selector.extend(\".guide .info\", \".info\", \".content nav.sidebar\");\n// .guide .info, .guide .content nav.sidebar, .content .guide nav.sidebar\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@use \"sass:selector\"\n\n@debug selector.extend(\"a.disabled\", \"a\", \".link\")  // a.disabled, .link.disabled\n@debug selector.extend(\"a.disabled\", \"h1\", \"h2\")  // a.disabled\n@debug selector.extend(\".guide .info\", \".info\", \".content nav.sidebar\")\n// .guide .info, .guide .content nav.sidebar, .content .guide nav.sidebar\n```\n\n## selector.nest\n\nCombines `$selectors` as though they were nested within one another in the stylesheet.\n\nThe `$selectors` may contain placeholder selectors. Unlike other selector functions, all of them except the first may also contain parent selectors.\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@use \"sass:selector\";\n\n@debug selector.nest(\"ul\", \"li\"); // ul li\n@debug selector.nest(\".alert, .warning\", \"p\"); // .alert p, .warning p\n@debug selector.nest(\".alert\", \"&:hover\"); // .alert:hover\n@debug selector.nest(\".accordion\", \"&__copy\"); // .accordion__copy\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@use \"sass:selector\"\n\n@debug selector.nest(\"ul\", \"li\")  // ul li\n@debug selector.nest(\".alert, .warning\", \"p\")  // .alert p, .warning p\n@debug selector.nest(\".alert\", \"&:hover\")  // .alert:hover\n@debug selector.nest(\".accordion\", \"&__copy\")  // .accordion__copy\n```\n\n## selector.parse\n\nReturns `$selector` in the selector value format.\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@use \"sass:selector\";\n\n@debug selector.parse(\".main aside:hover, .sidebar p\");\n// ((unquote(\".main\") unquote(\"aside:hover\")),\n//  (unquote(\".sidebar\") unquote(\"p\")))\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@use \"sass:selector\"\n\n@debug selector.parse(\".main aside:hover, .sidebar p\")\n// ((unquote(\".main\") unquote(\"aside:hover\")),\n//  (unquote(\".sidebar\") unquote(\"p\")))\n```\n\n## selector.replace\n\nReturns a copy of `$selector` with all instances of `$original` replaced by `$replacement`.\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@use \"sass:selector\";\n\n@debug selector.replace(\"a.disabled\", \"a\", \".link\"); // .link.disabled\n@debug selector.replace(\"a.disabled\", \"h1\", \"h2\"); // a.disabled\n@debug selector.replace(\".guide .info\", \".info\", \".content nav.sidebar\");\n// .guide .content nav.sidebar, .content .guide nav.sidebar\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@use \"sass:selector\"\n\n@debug selector.replace(\"a.disabled\", \"a\", \".link\")  // .link.disabled\n@debug selector.replace(\"a.disabled\", \"h1\", \"h2\")  // a.disabled\n@debug selector.replace(\".guide .info\", \".info\", \".content nav.sidebar\")\n// .guide .content nav.sidebar, .content .guide nav.sidebar\n```\n\n## selector.unify\n\nReturns a selector that matches only elements matched by both `$selector1` and `$selector2`.\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@use \"sass:selector\";\n\n@debug selector.unify(\"a\", \".disabled\"); // a.disabled\n@debug selector.unify(\"a.disabled\", \"a.outgoing\"); // a.disabled.outgoing\n@debug selector.unify(\"a\", \"h1\"); // null\n@debug selector.unify(\".warning a\", \"main a\"); // .warning main a, main .warning a\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@use \"sass:selector\"\n\n@debug selector.unify(\"a\", \".disabled\")  // a.disabled\n@debug selector.unify(\"a.disabled\", \"a.outgoing\")  // a.disabled.outgoing\n@debug selector.unify(\"a\", \"h1\")  // null\n@debug selector.unify(\".warning a\", \"main a\")  // .warning main a, .warning main a\n```\n\n## selector.simple-selectors\n\nReturns a list of simple selectors in `$selector`.\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@use \"sass:selector\";\n\n@debug selector.simple-selectors(\"a.disabled\"); // a, .disabled\n@debug selector.simple-selectors(\"main.blog:after\"); // main, .blog, :after\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@use \"sass:selector\"\n\n@debug selector.simple-selectors(\"a.disabled\")  // a, .disabled\n@debug selector.simple-selectors(\"main.blog:after\")  // main, .blog, :after\n```\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/selector", "title": "sass:selector", "description": "This documentation page covers the Sass selector module, detailing its functions and usage for manipulating selectors in Sass.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 25, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 01:59:19", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"title": "Sass: sass:selector", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "favicon": "https://sass-lang.com/icon.png", "language": "en", "description": "Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets", "scrapeId": "2f0f7443-0b8b-4cae-9c76-b7c4addf8975", "sourceURL": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/selector", "url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/selector/", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Numeric Operators is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Numeric Operators in sass.\n\n# Numeric Operators\n\nSass supports the standard set of mathematical operators for numbers. They automatically convert between compatible units.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Numeric Operators\n\nSass supports the standard set of mathematical operators for numbers. They automatically convert between compatible units.\n\n- `<expression> + <expression>` adds the first expression’s value to the second’s.\n- `<expression> - <expression>` subtracts the first expression’s value from the second’s.\n- `<expression> * <expression>` multiplies the first expression’s value by the second’s.\n- `<expression> % <expression>` returns the remainder of the first expression’s value divided by the second’s. This is known as the modulo operator.\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@debug 10s + 15s; // 25s\n@debug 1in - 10px; // 0.8958333333in\n@debug 5px * 3px; // 15px*px\n@debug 1in % 9px; // 0.0625in\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@debug 10s + 15s  // 25s\n@debug 1in - 10px  // 0.8958333333in\n@debug 5px * 3px  // 15px*px\n@debug 1in % 9px  // 0.0625in\n```\n\n## Unitless Numbers\n\nUnitless numbers can be used with numbers of any unit.\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@debug 100px + 50; // 150px\n@debug 4s * 10; // 40s\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@debug 100px + 50  // 150px\n@debug 4s * 10  // 40s\n```\n\n## Incompatible Units\n\nNumbers with incompatible units can’t be used with addition, subtraction, or modulo.\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@debug 100px + 10s;\n//     ^^^^^^^^^^^\n// Error: Incompatible units px and s.\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@debug 100px + 10s\n//     ^^^^^^^^^^^\n// Error: Incompatible units px and s.\n```\n\n## Unary Operators\n\nYou can also write `+` and `-` as unary operators, which take only one value:\n\n- `+<expression>` returns the expression’s value without changing it.\n- `-<expression>` returns the negative version of the expression’s value.\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@debug +(5s + 7s); // 12s\n@debug -(50px + 30px); // -80px\n@debug -(10px - 15px); // 5px\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@debug +(5s + 7s)  // 12s\n@debug -(50px + 30px)  // -80px\n@debug -(10px - 15px)  // 5px\n```\n\n## Heads up!\n\nBecause `-` can refer to both subtraction and unary negation, it can be confusing which is which in a space-separated list. To be safe:\n\n- Always write spaces on both sides of `-` when subtracting.\n- Write a space before `-` but not after for a negative number or a unary negation.\n- Wrap unary negation in parentheses if it’s in a space-separated list.\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@debug a-1; // a-1\n@debug 5px-3px; // 2px\n@debug 5-3; // 2\n@debug 1 -2 3; // 1 -2 3\n\n$number: 2;\n@debug 1 -$number 3; // -1 3\n@debug 1 (-$number) 3; // 1 -2 3\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@debug a-1  // a-1\n@debug 5px-3px  // 2px\n@debug 5-3  // 2\n@debug 1 -2 3  // 1 -2 3\n\n$number: 2\n@debug 1 -$number 3  // -1 3\n@debug 1 (-$number) 3  // 1 -2 3\n```\n\n## Division\n\nUnlike other mathematical operations, division in Sass is done with the `math.div()` function. Although many programming languages use `/` as a division operator, in CSS `/` is used as a separator.\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@use \"sass:list\";\n\n@debug 15px / 30px; // 15px/30px\n@debug (10px + 5px) / 30px; // 0.5\n@debug list.slash(10px + 5px, 30px); // 15px/30px\n\n$result: 15px / 30px;\n@debug $result; // 0.5\n\n@function fifteen-divided-by-thirty() {\n  @return 15px / 30px;\n}\n@debug fifteen-divided-by-thirty(); // 0.5\n@debug (15px/30px); // 0.5\n@debug (bold 15px/30px sans-serif); // bold 15px/30px sans-serif\n@debug 15px/30px + 1; // 1.5\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@use \"sass:list\";\n\n@debug 15px / 30px  // 15px/30px\n@debug (10px + 5px) / 30px  // 0.5\n@debug list.slash(10px + 5px, 30px)  // 15px/30px\n\n$result: 15px / 30px\n@debug $result  // 0.5\n\n@function fifteen-divided-by-thirty()\n  @return 15px / 30px\n\n@debug fifteen-divided-by-thirty()  // 0.5\n@debug (15px/30px)  // 0.5\n@debug (bold 15px/30px sans-serif)  // bold 15px/30px sans-serif\n@debug 15px/30px + 1  // 1.5\n```\n\n## Units\n\nSass has powerful support for manipulating units based on how real-world unit calculations work. When two numbers are multiplied, their units are multiplied as well.\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@use 'sass:math';\n\n@debug 4px * 6px; // 24px*px (read \"square pixels\")\n@debug math.div(5px, 2s); // 2.5px/s (read \"pixels per second\")\n\n@debug 5px * math.div(math.div(30deg, 2s), 24em);\n\n$degrees-per-second: math.div(20deg, 1s);\n@debug $degrees-per-second; // 20deg/s\n@debug math.div(1, $degrees-per-second); // 0.05s/deg\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@use 'sass:math'\n\n@debug 4px * 6px  // 24px*px (read \"square pixels\")\n@debug math.div(5px, 2s)  // 2.5px/s (read \"pixels per second\")\n\n@debug 5px * math.div(math.div(30deg, 2s), 24em)\n\n$degrees-per-second: math.div(20deg, 1s)\n@debug $degrees-per-second  // 20deg/s\n@debug math.div(1, $degrees-per-second)  // 0.05s/deg\n```\n\n## Heads up!\n\nBecause CSS doesn’t support complex units like square pixels, using a number with complex units as a property value will produce an error.\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@debug 1in + 6px; // 102px or 1.0625in\n\n@debug 1in + 1s;\n//     ^^^^^^^^\n// Error: Incompatible units s and in.\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@debug 1in + 6px  // 102px or 1.0625in\n\n@debug 1in + 1s\n//     ^^^^^^^^\n// Error: Incompatible units s and in.\n```\n\n## Transition Example\n\nAs in real-world unit calculations, if the numerator contains units that are compatible with units in the denominator, they’ll cancel out.\n\n## SCSS Syntax\n\n```scss\n@use 'sass:math';\n\n$transition-speed: math.div(1s, 50px);\n\n@mixin move($left-start, $left-stop) {\n  position: absolute;\n  left: $left-start;\n  transition: left ($left-stop - $left-start) * $transition-speed;\n\n  &:hover {\n    left: $left-stop;\n  }\n}\n\n.slider {\n  @include move(10px, 120px);\n}\n```\n\n## Sass Syntax\n\n```sass\n@use 'sass:math'\n\n$transition-speed: math.div(1s, 50px)\n\n@mixin move($left-start, $left-stop)\n  position: absolute\n  left: $left-start\n  transition: left ($left-stop - $left-start) * $transition-speed\n\n  &:hover\n    left: $left-stop\n\n.slider\n  @include move(10px, 120px)\n```\n\n## CSS Output\n\n```css\n.slider {\n  position: absolute;\n  left: 10px;\n  transition: left 2.2s;\n}\n.slider:hover {\n  left: 120px;\n}\n```\n\n## Heads up!\n\nIf your arithmetic gives you the wrong unit, you probably need to check your math.\n\n## Heads up!\n\nPercentages in Sass work just like every other unit. They are not interchangeable with decimals.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/operators/numeric", "title": "Numeric Operators", "description": "Sass supports the standard set of mathematical operators for numbers.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful sass expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Dart Sass Command-Line Interface is in sass?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Dart Sass Command-Line Interface in sass.\n\n# Dart Sass Command-Line Interface\n\nThis documentation covers the usage, options, and features of the Dart Sass command-line interface for compiling Sass to CSS.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Usage\n\nThe Dart Sass executable can be invoked in one of two modes.\n\n## One-to-One Mode\n\nOne-to-one mode compiles a single input file ( `input.scss`) to a single output location ( `output.css`). If no output location is passed, the compiled CSS is printed to the terminal.\n\nThe input file is parsed as [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax#scss) if its extension is `.scss`, as the [indented syntax](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax#the-indented-syntax) if its extension is `.sass`, or as [plain CSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/import/#importing-css) if its extension is `.css`. If it doesn’t have one of these three extensions, or if it comes from standard input, it’s parsed as SCSS by default. This can be controlled with the [`--indented` flag](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass/#indented).\n\nThe special string `-` can be passed in place of the input file to tell Sass to read the input file from [standard input](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_input_(stdin)). Sass will default to parsing it as SCSS unless the [`--indented` flag](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass/#indented) is passed.\n\n## Many-to-Many Mode\n\nMany-to-many mode compiles one or more input files to one or more output files. The inputs are separated from the outputs with colons. It can also compile all Sass files in a directory to CSS files with the same names in another directory.\n\nWhen compiling whole directories, Sass will ignore [partial files](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/import/#partials) whose names begin with `_`. You can use partials to separate out your stylesheets without creating a bunch of unnecessary output files.\n\n## Options\n\nThese options control how Sass loads its input files and how it produces output files.\n\n## Input and Output\n\nThese options control how Sass loads its input files and how it produces output files.\n\n## `--stdin`\n\nThis flag is an alternative way of telling Sass that it should read its input file from [standard input](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_input_(stdin)). When it’s passed, no input file may be passed.\n\n## `--indented`\n\nThis flag tells Sass to parse the input file as the [indented syntax](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax#the-indented-syntax). If it’s used in [many-to-many mode](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass/#many-to-many-mode), all input files are parsed as the indented syntax, although files they [use](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use) will have their syntax determined as usual.\n\n## `--load-path`\n\nThis option (abbreviated `-I`) adds an additional [load path](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use#load-paths) for Sass to look for stylesheets. It can be passed multiple times to provide multiple load paths.\n\n## `--pkg-importer=node`\n\nThis option (abbreviated `-p node`) adds the [Node.js `pkg:` importer](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use#node-js-package-importer) to the end of the load path, so that stylesheets can load dependencies using the Node.js module resolution algorithm.\n\n## `--style`\n\nThis option (abbreviated `-s`) controls the output style of the resulting CSS. Dart Sass supports two output styles: `expanded` (the default) and `compressed`.\n\n## `--no-charset`\n\nThis flag tells Sass never to emit a `@charset` declaration or a UTF-8 [byte-order mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark#UTF-8).\n\n## `--error-css`\n\nThis flag tells Sass whether to emit a CSS file when an error occurs during compilation.\n\n## `--update`\n\nIf the `--update` flag is passed, Sass will only compile stylesheets whose dependencies have been modified more recently than the corresponding CSS file was generated.\n\n## Source Maps\n\nSource maps are files that tell browsers or other tools that consume CSS how that CSS corresponds to the Sass files from which it was generated.\n\n## `--no-source-map`\n\nIf the `--no-source-map` flag is passed, Sass won’t generate any source maps.\n\n## `--source-map-urls`\n\nThis option controls how the source maps that Sass generates link back to the Sass files that contributed to the generated CSS.\n\n## `--embed-sources`\n\nThis flag tells Sass to embed the entire contents of the Sass files that contributed to the generated CSS in the source map.\n\n## `--embed-source-map`\n\nThis flag tells Sass to embed the contents of the source map file in the generated CSS.\n\n## Other Options\n\nVarious other options available for Dart Sass.\n\n## `--watch`\n\nThis flag (abbreviated `-w`) acts like the [`--update` flag](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass/#update), but after the first round compilation is done Sass stays open and continues compiling stylesheets whenever they or their dependencies change.\n\n## `--poll`\n\nThis flag, which may only be passed along with `--watch`, tells Sass to manually check for changes to the source files every so often.\n\n## `--stop-on-error`\n\nThis flag tells Sass to stop compiling immediately when an error is detected.\n\n## `--interactive`\n\nThis flag (abbreviated `-i`) tells Sass to run in interactive mode.\n\n## `--color`\n\nThis flag (abbreviated `-c`) tells Sass to emit [terminal colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Colors).\n\n## `--no-unicode`\n\nThis flag tells Sass only to emit ASCII characters to the terminal as part of error messages.\n\n## `--verbose`\n\nThis flag tells Sass to emit _all_ deprecation warnings when compiling.\n\n## `--quiet`\n\nThis flag (abbreviated `-q`) tells Sass not to emit any warnings when compiling.\n\n## `--quiet-deps`\n\nThis flag tells Sass not to emit deprecation warnings that come from dependencies.\n\n## `--fatal-deprecation`\n\nThis option tells Sass to treat a particular type of deprecation warning as an error.\n\n## `--future-deprecation`\n\nThis option tells Sass to opt-in to a future type of deprecation warning early.\n\n## `--silence-deprecation`\n\nThis option tells Sass to silence a particular type of deprecation warning.\n\n## `--trace`\n\nThis flag tells Sass to print the full Dart or JavaScript stack trace when an error is encountered.\n\n## `--help`\n\nThis flag (abbreviated `-h`) prints a summary of this documentation.\n\n## `--version`\n\nThis flag prints the current version of Sass.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass", "title": "Dart Sass Command-Line Interface", "description": "This documentation covers the usage, options, and features of the Dart Sass command-line interface for compiling Sass to CSS.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 34, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 04:39:48", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"description": "Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets", "language": "en", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "title": "Sass: Dart Sass Command-Line Interface", "favicon": "https://sass-lang.com/icon.png", "scrapeId": "88975ada-ead2-47d1-8205-f38388ee53c5", "sourceURL": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass", "url": "https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass/", "statusCode": 200}}}
