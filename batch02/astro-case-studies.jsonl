{"text": "System: You are a helpful astro-case-studies expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Contenda Share Pear Case Study is in astro-case-studies?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Contenda Share Pear Case Study in astro-case-studies.\n\n# Contenda Share Pear Case Study\n\nThis case study discusses how Contenda, an AI company, utilized Astro and Netlify to create Share Pear, an open-source tool for sharing Markdown blog post previews.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Challenges\n\nContenda is a team of less than 10 people. They often need to share blogs with each other in order to address pain points and conduct reviews but they couldn’t do these things without sharing their emails and API keys with one another. This also posed a security problem for customers that they knew they had to solve eventually. To resolve these issues for internal and external users, Contenda created Share Pear, an open-source tool for quickly sharing Markdown blog post previews.\n\n## Requirements\n\nShare Pear needed to be built without requiring backend changes since Contenda did not want to overload themselves by managing additional complexity. Ideally, it also needed to be cost-effective but preferably free. In addition to meeting their requirements, the main benefit of choosing Astro was its flexibility. With Astro, popular JavaScript frameworks like React are available, but optional. A site can be built using just HTML, CSS and, if necessary, vanilla JavaScript. This enables team members with less web development experience, such as product designers and content authors, to edit and maintain the site often without any developer intervention required. Cassidy (Contenda CTO) saw an opportunity to pair Astro with Netlify’s on-demand builders. Astro was the obvious choice because it had a component that both natively supported Netlify’s builders and rendering markdown to HTML. It also helped that Contenda had previously chosen Astro for their main marketing website so the technology was familiar enough for the rest of the team to jump in.\n\n## Solution and Implementation\n\nContenda found success in Astro’s developer community. The team was able to enlist the help of the core team and active contributors in Astro’s community Discord server. From there, building Share Pear moved quickly. \"This was my first time using Astro. I would say, getting started with Astro was simpler than other frameworks. It felt like the onboarding time was way smoother and especially the docs are so up-to-date that it’s a 1-to-1 match with your code sometimes.\" — Grady Salzman, Software Engineer @ Contenda\n\n## Results\n\nShare Pear has been online for about a month and is used by both the open-source community and customers of Contenda that use their app. At time of writing, 30% of their users share blogs using the Share Pear method and this feature has become one of the top 3 most used on the platform. It took Contenda just one month to build this feature. The team estimates it would have taken them double or triple the time if they had not chosen Astro as their solution.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://astro.build/case-studies/contenda-share-pear", "title": "Contenda Share Pear Case Study", "description": "This case study discusses how Contenda, an AI company, utilized Astro and Netlify to create Share Pear, an open-source tool for sharing Markdown blog post previews.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 4, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 02:51:13", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"twitter:description": "How an AI content company used Astro and Netlify's on-demand builders to enable users to share their generated blog posts with each other - all in one month.", "twitter:image": "https://astro.build/_astro/social-image.mgAxEgHM.webp", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og:title": "Content for Everyone: How Astro Helped Contenda Build a Content-Sharing Platform in One Month | Astro", "og:url": "https://astro.build/case-studies/contenda-share-pear/", "theme-color": "#8D46E7", "og:type": "article", "twitter:title": "Content for Everyone: How Astro Helped Contenda Build a Content-Sharing Platform in One Month | Astro", "ogUrl": "https://astro.build/case-studies/contenda-share-pear/", "generator": "Astro v5.1.7", "ogSiteName": "Astro", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:site_name": "Astro", "ogTitle": "Content for Everyone: How Astro Helped Contenda Build a Content-Sharing Platform in One Month | Astro", "favicon": "https://astro.build/favicon.svg", "twitter:image:alt": "Content for Everyone", "title": "Content for Everyone: How Astro Helped Contenda Build a Content-Sharing Platform in One Month | Astro", "twitter:site": "astrodotbuild", "ogLocale": "en", "language": "en", "viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "How an AI content company used Astro and Netlify's on-demand builders to enable users to share their generated blog posts with each other - all in one month.", "og:locale": "en", "og:description": "How an AI content company used Astro and Netlify's on-demand builders to enable users to share their generated blog posts with each other - all in one month.", "ogImage": "https://astro.build/_astro/social-image.mgAxEgHM.webp", "og:image": "https://astro.build/_astro/social-image.mgAxEgHM.webp", "ogDescription": "How an AI content company used Astro and Netlify's on-demand builders to enable users to share their generated blog posts with each other - all in one month.", "og:image:alt": "Content for Everyone", "scrapeId": "d1e90190-d16f-41ff-a145-c91c37115de8", "sourceURL": "https://astro.build/case-studies/contenda-share-pear", "url": "https://astro.build/case-studies/contenda-share-pear/", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful astro-case-studies expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Firebase Case Study is in astro-case-studies?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Firebase Case Study in astro-case-studies.\n\n# Firebase Case Study\n\nThis case study discusses how Firebase improved their blog performance and publishing efficiency by migrating from Blogger to Astro.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Challenges\n\nFirebase’s team of 10 developers used to host their blog on Blogger. With this CMS, they had to first write a blog post in Google Docs and then convert the draft to a Blogger document. Even a short blog post could easily result in an hour of work before publishing.\n\nThe editing experience in Blogger was also problematic:\n\n1. Images and other interactive components required developers to handcraft the HTML.\n2. Blogger did not have profile images. You had to insert HTML and CSS to represent a profile image directly into the blog post.\n3. At times, you could not fix something even if you knew what was wrong! For example, accessibility improvements were hard to control in Blogger. This resulted in a sub-par experience for users.\n\n## Requirements\n\nAccording to David East, lead engineer on the blog team at Firebase, Firebase required a tool with a modern developer experience. They wanted to maintain a more performant blog and publish blogs faster with less friction on a collaborative developer team of 10.\n\n## Solution and Implementation\n\nWith Astro, new team members are able to get set up within 30 minutes thanks to the docs.\n\n> Docs were phenomenal. What I do think was super helpful is that Astro does a very good job of being very strong on convention. So when you’re trying to use it for the job it’s meant for, it’s just painfully clear what you’re doing. You’re never worried the chair will be pulled out from underneath you. You can always develop on these assumptions.\n\n— David East, Lead Engineer @ Firebase (Blog)\n\nThe Firebase developers were also able to achieve complex and accessible animations with Astro - a feat they could not have done with Blogger due to its limited templating. As an example, the team wanted to create the slice animation that’s on the Firebase blog homepage. However, this slice animation is extremely difficult to create on the web today. Instead, you have to take identical pieces of content on top of each other and remove certain sections on animation, like a curtain. Screen readers will try to read and tab through hidden content which is confusing for users. Firebase was able to build this animation accessibly due to Astro’s flexibility.\n\nThe parts of the migration related to Astro went quickly. They saw improvements just by being able to take their Google Doc content, converting it to Markdown using a plugin, and then pasting it into an Astro document. Most of the project time was actually spent on perfecting the design of the blog along with building the proof-of-concept itself.\n\n## Results\n\nBy switching from Blogger to Astro, the time needed to publish a standard blog post went from hours to minutes. It also used to take them 6 minutes to generate a full site with GitHub Actions. Now, build time with GitHub Actions averages 1.5 minutes, an overall build time reduction of 75%.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://astro.build/case-studies/firebase", "title": "Firebase Case Study", "description": "This case study discusses how Firebase improved their blog performance and publishing efficiency by migrating from Blogger to Astro.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 4, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 02:51:50", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"language": "en", "ogLocale": "en", "ogDescription": "How Firebase, a Google-backed company, used Astro to improve their blog performance by 71%.", "og:locale": "en", "ogImage": "https://astro.build/_astro/social-image.CgU7It55.webp", "og:description": "How Firebase, a Google-backed company, used Astro to improve their blog performance by 71%.", "og:image": "https://astro.build/_astro/social-image.CgU7It55.webp", "og:type": "article", "og:url": "https://astro.build/case-studies/firebase/", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "generator": "Astro v5.1.7", "twitter:image": "https://astro.build/_astro/social-image.CgU7It55.webp", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "ogSiteName": "Astro", "favicon": "https://astro.build/favicon.svg", "og:title": "Release Content Faster: How Firebase Cut Blog Publishing From Hours to Minutes with Astro | Astro", "og:site_name": "Astro", "title": "Release Content Faster: How Firebase Cut Blog Publishing From Hours to Minutes with Astro | Astro", "ogTitle": "Release Content Faster: How Firebase Cut Blog Publishing From Hours to Minutes with Astro | Astro", "ogUrl": "https://astro.build/case-studies/firebase/", "theme-color": "#8D46E7", "description": "How Firebase, a Google-backed company, used Astro to improve their blog performance by 71%.", "twitter:site": "astrodotbuild", "og:image:alt": "Release Content Faster", "twitter:description": "How Firebase, a Google-backed company, used Astro to improve their blog performance by 71%.", "twitter:image:alt": "Release Content Faster", "twitter:title": "Release Content Faster: How Firebase Cut Blog Publishing From Hours to Minutes with Astro | Astro", "viewport": "width=device-width", "scrapeId": "96067621-bcb8-4672-b57b-910247b2818a", "sourceURL": "https://astro.build/case-studies/firebase", "url": "https://astro.build/case-studies/firebase/", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful astro-case-studies expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Microsoft Case Study is in astro-case-studies?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Microsoft Case Study in astro-case-studies.\n\n# Microsoft Case Study\n\nThis case study discusses how Microsoft utilized Astro to build their Fluent 2 website, focusing on the challenges faced, requirements, solutions, and results achieved.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Challenges\n\nMicrosoft made several attempts to build their design docs using other frameworks and CMS. They found that these tools were either too rigid, hard to maintain, or migrating was painful. Others did not integrate well with their Figma workflow and the design stories they wanted to tell.\n\nThe team took a step back to reassess their priorities and determined that they should focus on the design system and what architecture they actually needed. It turns out their content and designs weren’t suited for a CMS because they had a lot of custom components that they could not reuse. They were unique and required engineering input.\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe team wanted something lightweight and low maintenance on the DevOps side for the Fluent 2 website. This tool would have to support their design system library, which had a React version published. Extensibility was also important i.e. they wanted to be able to add CMS or DocSearch e.g. Algolia later on if they wanted to. Lastly, they wanted to be able to support legacy Storybook iframes to share code examples but be able to migrate off them eventually.\n\n## Solution and Implementation\n\nAstro ships zero JavaScript by default, making it perfectly lightweight and performant for Microsoft. Being tool agnostic, Astro also supports other frameworks which meant Microsoft could continue to support their design system library built with React. In the future, they hope to improve the content editing experience by re-adding a CMS. Some of the CMS’ supported by the Astro ecosystem are Storyblok, CloudCannon, and Sanity.\n\nWhen asked what was the most advantageous part of choosing Astro, Tudor said the following:\n\n> “It’s very important to us that Astro is able to generate fully static files. This is very advantageous for us because we want to be protected from multiple things such as DDoS attacks. So, having a product that relies a lot on a back-end service might cause issues. In these times, having a fully static website, and hosting it on Azure, is very advantageous for security and scalability.”\n\n— Tudor Popa, Engineering Manager @ Microsoft (Fluent 2)\n\nAstro also made it possible for Microsoft to continue supporting legacy Storybook iframes until the team was ready to migrate away. This allowed Microsoft to maintain a good experience for external and internal users while they changed their technology stack under the hood.\n\nMicrosoft designed and built the new Fluent 2 website with Astro over the course of 10 months, including over 200 pages of new content.\n\n## Results\n\nAstro helped the Fluent team build new pages in half the time compared to their previous stack. Astro also helped developers and designers on the team stay aligned with the full power of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\n\nUse of the Fluent 2 design system has since been used across many products in the company including Office products, Windows, and Teams. With this setup, Microsoft is able to implement Figma designs for a simple page in 20-30 minutes.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://astro.build/case-studies/microsoft", "title": "Microsoft Case Study", "description": "This case study discusses how Microsoft utilized Astro to build their Fluent 2 website, focusing on the challenges faced, requirements, solutions, and results achieved.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 4, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 02:52:37", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"generator": "Astro v5.1.7", "og:title": "Web Pages in Half the Time: Why Microsoft Chose Astro to Build Their Fluent 2 Design System Website | Astro", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "ogLocale": "en", "og:site_name": "Astro", "viewport": "width=device-width", "ogDescription": "How Microsoft, a household name, made large performance gains using Astro for their Fluent 2 design system website.", "favicon": "https://astro.build/favicon.svg", "ogTitle": "Web Pages in Half the Time: Why Microsoft Chose Astro to Build Their Fluent 2 Design System Website | Astro", "og:type": "article", "og:url": "https://astro.build/case-studies/microsoft/", "og:description": "How Microsoft, a household name, made large performance gains using Astro for their Fluent 2 design system website.", "theme-color": "#8D46E7", "title": "Web Pages in Half the Time: Why Microsoft Chose Astro to Build Their Fluent 2 Design System Website | Astro", "og:image": "https://astro.build/_astro/social-image.COsqGD0M.webp", "twitter:title": "Web Pages in Half the Time: Why Microsoft Chose Astro to Build Their Fluent 2 Design System Website | Astro", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "ogUrl": "https://astro.build/case-studies/microsoft/", "twitter:image": "https://astro.build/_astro/social-image.COsqGD0M.webp", "twitter:image:alt": "Web Pages in Half The Time", "ogSiteName": "Astro", "description": "How Microsoft, a household name, made large performance gains using Astro for their Fluent 2 design system website.", "og:locale": "en", "language": "en", "ogImage": "https://astro.build/_astro/social-image.COsqGD0M.webp", "twitter:site": "astrodotbuild", "twitter:description": "How Microsoft, a household name, made large performance gains using Astro for their Fluent 2 design system website.", "og:image:alt": "Web Pages in Half The Time", "scrapeId": "ef9a6b0f-0633-4891-96bd-5c73714a9509", "sourceURL": "https://astro.build/case-studies/microsoft", "url": "https://astro.build/case-studies/microsoft/", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful astro-case-studies expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Thinkmill Case Study is in astro-case-studies?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Thinkmill Case Study in astro-case-studies.\n\n# Thinkmill Case Study\n\nThis case study explores how Thinkmill, an engineering and design consultancy, utilized Astro to enhance team productivity and simplify web development processes.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Challenges\n\nThinkmill is a slightly unconventional agency. They have no project managers and are instead made up of a collective of designers and developers that like working together. Under this structure, it’s not uncommon for folks in different disciplines to be working together on the same parts of a project - even if it’s not their forte. Herein lay Thinkmill’s major challenge.\n\nThe team wanted designers and content editors to be able to autonomously contribute to the codebase. However, their previous tech stack used Next.js because the team liked React. This made it difficult for non-developers and less experienced developers to contribute. As a result, updating the website required the team to enlist the help of a senior developer. This would take the developer out of their flow state and into an entirely different context - one that would take time for them to gather enough data on to deliver the work. It would also halt the work of whichever person was initially responsible for the work because they needed to get unblocked.\n\n## Requirements\n\nIn order to maintain a website that was easy to use for both less experienced developers as well as folks that were not familiar with code, Thinkmill needed a solution that was simple.\n\nSimon Swiss, Developer Advocate at Thinkmill, strongly advocated for the team to use Astro because it was extremely well documented. Anyone that wanted to jump into the website could easily upskill themselves to start contributing. Non-senior developers could manage the site with only HTML and CSS while senior developers who favoured React could feel at home with the JSX syntax. Astro also came with highly desirable content features such as MDX support, syntax highlighting and pagination out of the box so Thinkmill did not have to build those features.\n\n## Solution and Implementation\n\nWhen asked what the two most advantageous things about Astro were, Simon cited strong documentation and ease of entry for non-senior engineers.\n\nAccording to Simon, Astro was easy to explain to both sides.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful astro-case-studies expert.\n\nUser: How do I challenges in astro-case-studies?\n\nAssistant: To challenges in astro-case-studies, here's what you do:\nThinkmill is a slightly unconventional agency. They have no project managers and are instead made up of a collective of designers and developers that like working together. Under this structure, it’s not uncommon for folks in different disciplines to be working together on the same parts of a project - even if it’s not their forte. Herein lay Thinkmill’s major challenge.\n\nThe team wanted designers and content editors to be able to autonomously contribute to the codebase. However, their previous tech stack used Next.js because the team liked React. This made it difficult for non-developers and less experienced developers to contribute. As a result, updating the website required the team to enlist the help of a senior developer. This would take the developer out of their flow state and into an entirely different context - one that would take time for them to gather enough data on to deliver the work. It would also halt the work of whichever person was initially responsible for the work because they needed to get unblocked..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://astro.build/case-studies/thinkmill", "title": "Thinkmill Case Study", "description": "This case study explores how Thinkmill, an engineering and design consultancy, utilized Astro to enhance team productivity and simplify web development processes.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 4, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 02:52:56", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"title": "No More Bottlenecks: How Thinkmill Reduced Dependencies on Senior Developers with Astro | Astro", "twitter:site": "astrodotbuild", "og:title": "No More Bottlenecks: How Thinkmill Reduced Dependencies on Senior Developers with Astro | Astro", "og:url": "https://astro.build/case-studies/thinkmill/", "og:image:alt": "No More Bottlenecks", "favicon": "https://astro.build/favicon.svg", "og:locale": "en", "twitter:title": "No More Bottlenecks: How Thinkmill Reduced Dependencies on Senior Developers with Astro | Astro", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "ogSiteName": "Astro", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "ogLocale": "en", "og:site_name": "Astro", "twitter:description": "How Thinkmill made their website so easy to work with that total repo contributors increased from 1 to 15.", "twitter:image:alt": "No More Bottlenecks", "theme-color": "#8D46E7", "twitter:image": "https://astro.build/_astro/social-image.Bq26bAi5.webp", "og:description": "How Thinkmill made their website so easy to work with that total repo contributors increased from 1 to 15.", "ogUrl": "https://astro.build/case-studies/thinkmill/", "ogImage": "https://astro.build/_astro/social-image.Bq26bAi5.webp", "language": "en", "ogTitle": "No More Bottlenecks: How Thinkmill Reduced Dependencies on Senior Developers with Astro | Astro", "generator": "Astro v5.1.7", "og:image": "https://astro.build/_astro/social-image.Bq26bAi5.webp", "ogDescription": "How Thinkmill made their website so easy to work with that total repo contributors increased from 1 to 15.", "description": "How Thinkmill made their website so easy to work with that total repo contributors increased from 1 to 15.", "viewport": "width=device-width", "og:type": "article", "scrapeId": "21d97bbf-9953-4f07-a7ba-e8f85a33286f", "sourceURL": "https://astro.build/case-studies/thinkmill", "url": "https://astro.build/case-studies/thinkmill/", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful astro-case-studies expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what WP Engine Case Study is in astro-case-studies?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain WP Engine Case Study in astro-case-studies.\n\n# WP Engine Case Study\n\nThis case study discusses how WP Engine improved their documentation process by adopting the Starlight framework built on Astro, resulting in faster content operations and reduced development costs.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Challenges\n\nThere were three main issues WP Engine had with their previous docs site. First, their docs used to be kept in a separate GitHub MDX repo from the Next.js shell that ingested those files. Every time MDX files were changed, it did not trigger automatic site rebuilds or previews. To work around this, the team had a dedicated development environment where they tested changes before deploying. However, this meant additional Git branch management. Second, both visual and functional changes to the docs site took a long time. On top of that, the previous docs site did not look great and did not have all features they wanted users to have. Third, because of the MDX to React solution, only developers could contribute. This prevented key docs contributors such as PMs or customer support folks from making changes themselves.\n\n## Requirements\n\nTo solve WP Engine’s three major challenges, they needed a low barrier-to-entry solution that improved ease of use for both docs maintainers and contributors. It needed to be something that removed unnecessary time spent on front-end development as a barrier to good docs.\n\n## Solution and Implementation\n\nIn August 2023, Astro had launched Starlight on Product Hunt to provide an open-source web framework for building modern documentation websites. Jeff was familiar with Astro but hadn’t had a good reason to use it yet. Starlight provided the perfect opportunity. Starlight was perfect for WP Engine because it came with every repeatable element they needed. It came with navigation, search, i18n, syntax highlighting, dark mode, and more out of the box. What’s more, every single element looked good! There were also many customization options including being able to easily specify light and dark mode logos. This was all possible without having to write much custom CSS, if at all. This would make it possible for WP Engine to focus primarily on writing content instead of spending several sprints building user interfaces. The Starlight framework was also a fully static solution shipping only HTML. This lowered the onboarding time for both docs maintainers and contributors when making changes to the site because both parties did not have to learn Javascript nor React to ship something. Migrating off their previous solution and into Astro was virtually painless. All Jeff’s team had to do was copy the existing folder of ~100 MDX files into the Starlight template and they had a live site. They could manage everything they needed through a config and a simple CSS stylesheet. It took minimal training for their docs team to onboard onto Starlight because of how easy it was to use.\n\n## Results\n\nWith WP engine’s previous solution, their team spent more time managing the docs site than working with actual content. If the ratio of writing content vs. managing the site was 30:70 before, it was now closer to 95:5. Astro’s Starlight framework reduced friction by such an order of magnitude that a PM on WP Engine’s team had this to say about the new web framework: \"It’s just so much better in terms of experience for our customers but it also saved SO MANY HOURS of my life that I’d otherwise have to spend meticulously testing and shaping new pages to Atlas docs.\" — Product Manager at WP Engine WP Engine’s content operations is more than 2x faster as a result of removing so many Git procedures and manual testing steps. Because the process is easier, people are also more willing to contribute. Starlight also helped lower their development costs by more than 50% because it provided all of the UI elements WP Engine needed out of the box.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful astro-case-studies expert.\n\nUser: How do I challenges in astro-case-studies?\n\nAssistant: To challenges in astro-case-studies, here's what you do:\nThere were three main issues WP Engine had with their previous docs site. First, their docs used to be kept in a separate GitHub MDX repo from the Next.js shell that ingested those files. Every time MDX files were changed, it did not trigger automatic site rebuilds or previews. To work around this, the team had a dedicated development environment where they tested changes before deploying. However, this meant additional Git branch management. Second, both visual and functional changes to the docs site took a long time. On top of that, the previous docs site did not look great and did not have all features they wanted users to have. Third, because of the MDX to React solution, only developers could contribute. This prevented key docs contributors such as PMs or customer support folks from making changes themselves..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://astro.build/case-studies/wp-engine", "title": "WP Engine Case Study", "description": "This case study discusses how WP Engine improved their documentation process by adopting the Starlight framework built on Astro, resulting in faster content operations and reduced development costs.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 4, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 02:53:23", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"description": "How WP Engine, the world’s largest managed WordPress hosting provider, went from spending most of their time managing their content to actually writing it.", "title": "Slashing Development Costs: How WP Engine Lowered Development Costs by Over 50% with Astro’s Starlight | Astro", "ogTitle": "Slashing Development Costs: How WP Engine Lowered Development Costs by Over 50% with Astro’s Starlight | Astro", "og:url": "https://astro.build/case-studies/wp-engine/", "og:description": "How WP Engine, the world’s largest managed WordPress hosting provider, went from spending most of their time managing their content to actually writing it.", "theme-color": "#8D46E7", "favicon": "https://astro.build/favicon.svg", "twitter:image": "https://astro.build/_astro/social-image.DP4JeQFo.webp", "ogImage": "https://astro.build/_astro/social-image.DP4JeQFo.webp", "ogSiteName": "Astro", "og:image": "https://astro.build/_astro/social-image.DP4JeQFo.webp", "ogLocale": "en", "og:title": "Slashing Development Costs: How WP Engine Lowered Development Costs by Over 50% with Astro’s Starlight | Astro", "og:image:alt": "Slashing Development Costs", "ogUrl": "https://astro.build/case-studies/wp-engine/", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "twitter:site": "astrodotbuild", "twitter:title": "Slashing Development Costs: How WP Engine Lowered Development Costs by Over 50% with Astro’s Starlight | Astro", "twitter:image:alt": "Slashing Development Costs", "language": "en", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og:type": "article", "viewport": "width=device-width", "generator": "Astro v5.1.7", "ogDescription": "How WP Engine, the world’s largest managed WordPress hosting provider, went from spending most of their time managing their content to actually writing it.", "twitter:description": "How WP Engine, the world’s largest managed WordPress hosting provider, went from spending most of their time managing their content to actually writing it.", "og:locale": "en", "og:site_name": "Astro", "scrapeId": "6873b470-1d9e-46f7-b6c0-54c67d7e8d12", "sourceURL": "https://astro.build/case-studies/wp-engine", "url": "https://astro.build/case-studies/wp-engine/", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful astro-case-studies expert.\n\nUser: How do I solution and implementation in astro-case-studies?\n\nAssistant: To solution and implementation in astro-case-studies, here's what you do:\nIn August 2023, Astro had launched Starlight on Product Hunt to provide an open-source web framework for building modern documentation websites. Jeff was familiar with Astro but hadn’t had a good reason to use it yet. Starlight provided the perfect opportunity. Starlight was perfect for WP Engine because it came with every repeatable element they needed. It came with navigation, search, i18n, syntax highlighting, dark mode, and more out of the box. What’s more, every single element looked good! There were also many customization options including being able to easily specify light and dark mode logos. This was all possible without having to write much custom CSS, if at all. This would make it possible for WP Engine to focus primarily on writing content instead of spending several sprints building user interfaces. The Starlight framework was also a fully static solution shipping only HTML. This lowered the onboarding time for both docs maintainers and contributors when making changes to the site because both parties did not have to learn Javascript nor React to ship something. Migrating off their previous solution and into Astro was virtually painless. All Jeff’s team had to do was copy the existing folder of ~100 MDX files into the Starlight template and they had a live site. They could manage everything they needed through a config and a simple CSS stylesheet. It took minimal training for their docs team to onboard onto Starlight because of how easy it was to use..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://astro.build/case-studies/wp-engine", "title": "WP Engine Case Study", "description": "This case study discusses how WP Engine improved their documentation process by adopting the Starlight framework built on Astro, resulting in faster content operations and reduced development costs.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 4, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 02:53:23", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"description": "How WP Engine, the world’s largest managed WordPress hosting provider, went from spending most of their time managing their content to actually writing it.", "title": "Slashing Development Costs: How WP Engine Lowered Development Costs by Over 50% with Astro’s Starlight | Astro", "ogTitle": "Slashing Development Costs: How WP Engine Lowered Development Costs by Over 50% with Astro’s Starlight | Astro", "og:url": "https://astro.build/case-studies/wp-engine/", "og:description": "How WP Engine, the world’s largest managed WordPress hosting provider, went from spending most of their time managing their content to actually writing it.", "theme-color": "#8D46E7", "favicon": "https://astro.build/favicon.svg", "twitter:image": "https://astro.build/_astro/social-image.DP4JeQFo.webp", "ogImage": "https://astro.build/_astro/social-image.DP4JeQFo.webp", "ogSiteName": "Astro", "og:image": "https://astro.build/_astro/social-image.DP4JeQFo.webp", "ogLocale": "en", "og:title": "Slashing Development Costs: How WP Engine Lowered Development Costs by Over 50% with Astro’s Starlight | Astro", "og:image:alt": "Slashing Development Costs", "ogUrl": "https://astro.build/case-studies/wp-engine/", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "twitter:site": "astrodotbuild", "twitter:title": "Slashing Development Costs: How WP Engine Lowered Development Costs by Over 50% with Astro’s Starlight | Astro", "twitter:image:alt": "Slashing Development Costs", "language": "en", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og:type": "article", "viewport": "width=device-width", "generator": "Astro v5.1.7", "ogDescription": "How WP Engine, the world’s largest managed WordPress hosting provider, went from spending most of their time managing their content to actually writing it.", "twitter:description": "How WP Engine, the world’s largest managed WordPress hosting provider, went from spending most of their time managing their content to actually writing it.", "og:locale": "en", "og:site_name": "Astro", "scrapeId": "6873b470-1d9e-46f7-b6c0-54c67d7e8d12", "sourceURL": "https://astro.build/case-studies/wp-engine", "url": "https://astro.build/case-studies/wp-engine/", "statusCode": 200}}}
{"text": "System: You are a helpful astro-case-studies expert.\n\nUser: How do I results in astro-case-studies?\n\nAssistant: To results in astro-case-studies, here's what you do:\nWith WP engine’s previous solution, their team spent more time managing the docs site than working with actual content. If the ratio of writing content vs. managing the site was 30:70 before, it was now closer to 95:5. Astro’s Starlight framework reduced friction by such an order of magnitude that a PM on WP Engine’s team had this to say about the new web framework: \"It’s just so much better in terms of experience for our customers but it also saved SO MANY HOURS of my life that I’d otherwise have to spend meticulously testing and shaping new pages to Atlas docs.\" — Product Manager at WP Engine WP Engine’s content operations is more than 2x faster as a result of removing so many Git procedures and manual testing steps. Because the process is easier, people are also more willing to contribute. Starlight also helped lower their development costs by more than 50% because it provided all of the UI elements WP Engine needed out of the box. Keeping their solution up-to-date is also significantly easier than before. Previously, they would have to manage several dependencies related to different UI elements i.e. drop downs.
