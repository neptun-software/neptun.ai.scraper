{"text": "System: You are a helpful shadcn-svelte expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Installation is in shadcn-svelte?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Installation in shadcn-svelte.\n\n# Installation\n\nHow to install dependencies and structure your app.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Guides\n\n[SvelteKit](https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/docs/installation/sveltekit) [Astro](https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/docs/installation/astro) [Vite](https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/docs/installation/vite) [Manual](https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/docs/installation/manual)\n\n## Imports\n\nUnlike the original [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for React, where the full components can exist in a single file, components in this port are split into multiple files. This is because Svelte doesn't support defining multiple components in a single file, so utilizing the CLI to add components will be the optimal approach.\n\nThe CLI will create a folder for _each_ component, which will sometimes just contain a single Svelte file, and in other times, multiple files. Within each folder, there will be an `index.ts` file that exports the component(s), so you can import them from a single file.\n\nFor example, the Accordion component is split into four `.svelte` files:\n\n- `Accordion.svelte`\n- `AccordionContent.svelte`\n- `AccordionItem.svelte`\n- `AccordionTrigger.svelte`\n\nThey can then be imported from the `accordion/index.ts` file like so:\n\n```\n\timport * as Accordion from '$lib/components/ui/accordion'\n// or\nimport {\n  Accordion,\n  AccordionContent,\n  AccordionItem,\n  AccordionTrigger\n} from \"$lib/components/ui/accordion\"\n```\n\nRegardless of the import approach you take, the components will be tree-shaken by Rollup, so you don't have to worry about unused components being bundled into your app.\n\n## TypeScript\n\nThis project and the components are written in TypeScript. We recommend using TypeScript for your project as well.\n\nHowever, we provide a JavaScript version of the components as well. The JavaScript version is _only_ available via the [CLI](https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/docs/cli).\n\n### Opt-out of TypeScript\n\nTo opt out of TypeScript, set the `typescript` flag to `false` in your `components.json` file.\n\ncomponents.json\n\n```\n\t{\n  \"style\": \"default\",\n  \"tailwind\": {\n    \"config\": \"tailwind.config.js\",\n    \"css\": \"src/app/globals.css\"\n  },\n  \"typescript\": false,\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"utils\": \"$lib/utils\",\n    \"components\": \"$lib/components\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTo configure import aliases, create a `jsconfig.json` file:\n\njsconfig.json\n\n```\n\t{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"$lib/*\": [\"./src/lib/*\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/docs/installation", "title": "Installation", "description": "How to install dependencies and structure your app.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 3, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 21:59:45", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:type": "article", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:url": "https://shadcn-svelte.com/docs/installation", "og:title": "Installation - shadcn-svelte", "ogTitle": "Installation - shadcn-svelte", "twitter:site": "https://shadcn-svelte.com", "author": "huntabyte", "twitter:description": "Beautifully designed components built with Melt UI and Tailwind CSS.", "keywords": "shadcn,Svelte,SvelteKit,Svelte Components,TailwindCSS,Melt UI,Bit UI", "language": "en", "twitter:title": "Installation - shadcn-svelte", "ogLocale": "EN_US", "ogImage": "https://shadcn-svelte.com/og.png", "og:image:alt": "shadcn-svelte", "og:locale": "EN_US", "favicon": "https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/favicon.ico", "twitter:creator": "huntabyte", "description": "Beautifully designed components built with Melt UI and Tailwind CSS.", "twitter:image:alt": "shadcn-svelte", "ogUrl": "https://shadcn-svelte.com/docs/installation", "title": "Installation - shadcn-svelte", "twitter:image": "https://shadcn-svelte.com/og.png", "og:image": "https://shadcn-svelte.com/og.png", "og:description": "Beautifully designed components built with Melt UI and Tailwind CSS.", "og:image:height": "630", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "ogSiteName": "shadcn-svelte", "og:image:width": "1200", "og:site_name": "shadcn-svelte", "ogDescription": "Beautifully designed components built with Melt UI and Tailwind CSS.", "scrapeId": "83174c23-17fc-4c1d-ac05-42abc36f6060", "sourceURL": "https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/docs/installation", "url": "https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/docs/installation", "statusCode": 200}}}

Here are some tips to keep in mind:\n\nRegardless of the import approach you take, the components will be tree-shaken by Rollup, so you don't have to worry about unused components being bundled into your app.\n\nWe recommend using TypeScript for your project as well.\n\nTo ignore ESLint linting errors for specific components, you can add a `.eslintrc` file in the directory where you define your components.\n\nStick to these, and you'll avoid a lot of headaches!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/docs/installation", "title": "Installation", "description": "How to install dependencies and structure your app.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 3, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 21:59:45", "type": "best_practices", "page_metadata": {"og:type": "article", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:url": "https://shadcn-svelte.com/docs/installation", "og:title": "Installation - shadcn-svelte", "ogTitle": "Installation - shadcn-svelte", "twitter:site": "https://shadcn-svelte.com", "author": "huntabyte", "twitter:description": "Beautifully designed components built with Melt UI and Tailwind CSS.", "keywords": "shadcn,Svelte,SvelteKit,Svelte Components,TailwindCSS,Melt UI,Bit UI", "language": "en", "twitter:title": "Installation - shadcn-svelte", "ogLocale": "EN_US", "ogImage": "https://shadcn-svelte.com/og.png", "og:image:alt": "shadcn-svelte", "og:locale": "EN_US", "favicon": "https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/favicon.ico", "twitter:creator": "huntabyte", "description": "Beautifully designed components built with Melt UI and Tailwind CSS.", "twitter:image:alt": "shadcn-svelte", "ogUrl": "https://shadcn-svelte.com/docs/installation", "title": "Installation - shadcn-svelte", "twitter:image": "https://shadcn-svelte.com/og.png", "og:image": "https://shadcn-svelte.com/og.png", "og:description": "Beautifully designed components built with Melt UI and Tailwind CSS.", "og:image:height": "630", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "ogSiteName": "shadcn-svelte", "og:image:width": "1200", "og:site_name": "shadcn-svelte", "ogDescription": "Beautifully designed components built with Melt UI and Tailwind CSS.", "scrapeId": "83174c23-17fc-4c1d-ac05-42abc36f6060", "sourceURL": "https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/docs/installation", "url": "https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/docs/installation", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful shadcn-svelte expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what components.json is in shadcn-svelte?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain components.json in shadcn-svelte.\n\n# components.json\n\nConfiguration for your project.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Overview\n\nThe `components.json` file holds configuration for your project. We use it to understand how your project is set up and how to generate components customized for your project.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful shadcn-svelte expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Breadcrumb is in shadcn-svelte?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Breadcrumb in shadcn-svelte.\n\n# Breadcrumb\n\nDisplays the path to the current resource using a hierarchy of links.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Installation\n\n```\n\tnpx  shadcn-svelte@latest add breadcrumb\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```\n\t<script lang=\"ts\">\n  import * as Breadcrumb from \"$lib/components/ui/breadcrumb/index.js\";\n</script>\n\n<Breadcrumb.Root>\n  <Breadcrumb.List>\n    <Breadcrumb.Item>\n      <Breadcrumb.Link href=\"/\">Home</Breadcrumb.Link>\n    </Breadcrumb.Item>\n    <Breadcrumb.Separator />\n    <Breadcrumb.Item>\n      <Breadcrumb.Link href=\"/components\">Components</Breadcrumb.Link>\n    </Breadcrumb.Item>\n    <Breadcrumb.Separator />\n    <Breadcrumb.Item>\n      <Breadcrumb.Page>Breadcrumb</Breadcrumb.Page>\n    </Breadcrumb.Item>\n  </Breadcrumb.List>\n</Breadcrumb.Root>\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n### Custom separator\nUse a custom component in the `<slot>` of `<Breadcrumb.Separator />` to create a custom separator.\n\n```\n\t<script lang=\"ts\">\n  import Slash from \"svelte-radix/Slash.svelte\";\n  import * as Breadcrumb from \"$lib/components/ui/breadcrumb/index.js\";\n</script>\n\n<Breadcrumb.Root>\n  <Breadcrumb.List>\n    <Breadcrumb.Item>\n      <Breadcrumb.Link href=\"/\">Home</Breadcrumb.Link>\n    </Breadcrumb.Item>\n    <Breadcrumb.Separator>\n      <Slash tabindex=\"-1\" />\n    </Breadcrumb.Separator>\n    <Breadcrumb.Item>\n      <Breadcrumb.Link href=\"/components\">Components</Breadcrumb.Link>\n    </Breadcrumb.Item>\n    <Breadcrumb.Separator>\n      <Slash tabindex=\"-1\" />\n    </Breadcrumb.Separator>\n    <Breadcrumb.Item>\n      <Breadcrumb.Page>Breadcrumb</Breadcrumb.Page>\n    </Breadcrumb.Item>\n  </Breadcrumb.List>\n</Breadcrumb.Root>\n```\n\n### Dropdown\nYou can compose `<Breadcrumb.Item />` with a `<DropdownMenu />` to create a dropdown in the breadcrumb.\n\n```\n\t<script lang=\"ts\">\n  import ChevronDown from \"svelte-radix/ChevronDown.svelte\";\n  import Slash from \"svelte-radix/Slash.svelte\";\n  import * as Breadcrumb from \"$lib/components/ui/breadcrumb/index.js\";\n  import * as DropdownMenu from \"$lib/components/ui/dropdown-menu/index.js\";\n</script>\n\n<Breadcrumb.Root>\n  <Breadcrumb.List>\n    <Breadcrumb.Item>\n      <Breadcrumb.Link href=\"/\">Home</Breadcrumb.Link>\n    </Breadcrumb.Item>\n    <Breadcrumb.Separator>\n      <Slash />\n    </Breadcrumb.Separator>\n    <Breadcrumb.Item>\n      <DropdownMenu.Root>\n        <DropdownMenu.Trigger class=\"flex items-center gap-1\">\n          Components\n          <ChevronDown tabindex=\"-1\" />\n        </DropdownMenu.Trigger>\n        <DropdownMenu.Content align=\"start\">\n          <DropdownMenu.Item>Documentation</DropdownMenu.Item>\n          <DropdownMenu.Item>Themes</DropdownMenu.Item>\n          <DropdownMenu.Item>GitHub</DropdownMenu.Item>\n        </DropdownMenu.Content>\n      </DropdownMenu.Root>\n    </Breadcrumb.Item>\n    <Breadcrumb.Separator>\n      <Slash tabindex=\"-1\" />\n    </Breadcrumb.Separator>\n    <Breadcrumb.Item>\n      <Breadcrumb.Page>Breadcrumb</Breadcrumb.Page>\n    </Breadcrumb.Item>\n  </Breadcrumb.List>\n</Breadcrumb.Root>\n```\n\n### Collapsed\nWe provide a `<Breadcrumb.Ellipsis />` component to show a collapsed state when the breadcrumb is too long.\n\n```\n\t<script lang=\"ts\">\n  import * as Breadcrumb from \"$lib/components/ui/breadcrumb/index.js\";\n</script>\n\n<Breadcrumb.Root>\n  <Breadcrumb.List>\n    <Breadcrumb.Item>\n      <Breadcrumb.Link href=\"/\">Home</Breadcrumb.Link>\n    </Breadcrumb.Item>\n    <Breadcrumb.Separator />\n    <Breadcrumb.Item>\n      <Breadcrumb.Ellipsis />\n    </Breadcrumb.Item>\n    <Breadcrumb.Separator />\n    <Breadcrumb.Item>\n      <Breadcrumb.Link href=\"/docs/components\">Components</Breadcrumb.Link>\n    </Breadcrumb.Item>\n    <Breadcrumb.Separator />\n    <Breadcrumb.Item>\n      <Breadcrumb.Page>Breadcrumb</Breadcrumb.Page>\n    </Breadcrumb.Item>\n  </Breadcrumb.List>\n</Breadcrumb.Root>\n```\n\n### Link component\nTo use a custom link component from your routing library, you can use the `asChild` prop on `<Breadcrumb.Link />`.\n\n```\n\t<script lang=\"ts\">\n  import * as Breadcrumb from \"$lib/components/ui/breadcrumb/index.js\";\n</script>\n\n<Breadcrumb.Root>\n  <Breadcrumb.List>\n    <Breadcrumb.Item>\n      <Breadcrumb.Link asChild let:attrs>\n        <a href=\"/\" {...attrs}>Home</a>\n      </Breadcrumb.Link>\n    </Breadcrumb.Item>\n    <Breadcrumb.Separator />\n    <Breadcrumb.Item>\n      <Breadcrumb.Link asChild let:attrs>\n        <a href=\"/components\" {...attrs}>Components</a>\n      </Breadcrumb.Link>\n    </Breadcrumb.Item>\n    <Breadcrumb.Separator />\n    <Breadcrumb.Item>\n      <Breadcrumb.Page>Breadcrumb</Breadcrumb.Page>\n    </Breadcrumb.Item>\n  </Breadcrumb.List>\n</Breadcrumb.Root>\n```\n\n### Responsive\nHere's an example of a responsive breadcrumb that composes `<Breadcrumb.Item />` with `<Breadcrumb.Ellipsis />`, `<DropdownMenu />`, and `<Drawer />`.\nIt displays a dropdown on desktop and a drawer on mobile.\n\n```\n\t<script lang=\"ts\">\n  import { mediaQuery } from \"svelte-legos\";\n  import * as Breadcrumb from \"$lib/components/ui/breadcrumb/index.js\";\n  import * as Drawer from \"$lib/components/ui/drawer/index.js\";\n  import * as DropdownMenu from \"$lib/components/ui/dropdown-menu/index.js\";\n  import { Button } from \"$lib/components/ui/button/index.js\";\n\n  const items = [\\\n    { href: \"#\", label: \"Home\" },\\\n    { href: \"#\", label: \"Documentation\" },\\\n    { href: \"#\", label: \"Building Your Application\" },\\\n    { href: \"#\", label: \"Data Fetching\" },\\\n    { label: \"Caching and Revalidating\" }\\\n  ];\n\n  const ITEMS_TO_DISPLAY = 3;\n\n  let open = false;\n\n  const isDesktop = mediaQuery(\"(min-width: 768px)\");\n</script>\n\n<Breadcrumb.Root>\n  <Breadcrumb.List>\n    <Breadcrumb.Item>\n      <Breadcrumb.Link href={items[0].href}>\n        {items[0].label}\n      </Breadcrumb.Link>\n    </Breadcrumb.Item>\n    <Breadcrumb.Separator />\n    {#if items.length > ITEMS_TO_DISPLAY}\n      <Breadcrumb.Item>\n        {#if $isDesktop}\n          <DropdownMenu.Root bind:open>\n            <DropdownMenu.Trigger\n              class=\"flex items-center gap-1\"\n              aria-label=\"Toggle menu\"\n            >\n

{"text": "System: You are a helpful shadcn-svelte expert.\n\nUser: How do I examples in shadcn-svelte?\n\nAssistant: To examples in shadcn-svelte, here's what you do:\n### Custom separator\nUse a custom component in the `<slot>` of `<Breadcrumb.Separator />` to create a custom separator.\n\n```\n\t<script lang=\"ts\">\n  import Slash from \"svelte-radix/Slash.svelte\";\n  import * as Breadcrumb from \"$lib/components/ui/breadcrumb/index.js\";\n</script>\n\n<Breadcrumb.Root>\n  <Breadcrumb.List>\n    <Breadcrumb.Item>\n      <Breadcrumb.Link href=\"/\">Home</Breadcrumb.Link>\n    </Breadcrumb.Item>\n    <Breadcrumb.Separator>\n      <Slash tabindex=\"-1\" />\n    </Breadcrumb.Separator>\n    <Breadcrumb.Item>\n      <Breadcrumb.Link href=\"/components\">Components</Breadcrumb.Link>\n    </Breadcrumb.Item>\n    <Breadcrumb.Separator>\n      <Slash tabindex=\"-1\" />\n    </Breadcrumb.Separator>\n    <Breadcrumb.Item>\n      <Breadcrumb.Page>Breadcrumb</Breadcrumb.Page>\n    </Breadcrumb.Item>\n  </Breadcrumb.List>\n</Breadcrumb.Root>\n```\n\n### Dropdown\nYou can compose `<Breadcrumb.Item />` with a `<DropdownMenu />` to create a dropdown in the breadcrumb.\n\n```\n\t<script lang=\"ts\">\n  import ChevronDown from \"svelte-radix/ChevronDown.svelte\";\n  import Slash from \"svelte-radix/Slash.svelte\";\n  import * as Breadcrumb from \"$lib/components/ui/breadcrumb/index.js\";\n  import * as DropdownMenu from \"$lib/components/ui/dropdown-menu/index.js\";\n</script>\n\n<Breadcrumb.Root>\n  <Breadcrumb.List>\n    <Breadcrumb.Item>\n      <Breadcrumb.Link href=\"/\">Home</Breadcrumb.Link>\n    </Breadcrumb.Item>\n    <Breadcrumb.Separator>\n      <Slash />\n    </Breadcrumb.Separator>\n    <Breadcrumb.Item>\n      <DropdownMenu.Root>\n        <DropdownMenu.Trigger class=\"flex items-center gap-1\">\n          Components\n          <ChevronDown tabindex=\"-1\" />\n        </DropdownMenu.Trigger>\n        <DropdownMenu.Content align=\"start\">\n          <DropdownMenu.Item>Documentation</DropdownMenu.Item>\n          <DropdownMenu.Item>Themes</DropdownMenu.Item>\n          <DropdownMenu.Item>GitHub</DropdownMenu.Item>\n        </DropdownMenu.Content>\n      </DropdownMenu.Root>\n    </Breadcrumb.Item>\n    <Breadcrumb.Separator>\n      <Slash tabindex=\"-1\" />\n    </Breadcrumb.Separator>\n    <Breadcrumb.Item>\n      <Breadcrumb.Page>Breadcrumb</Breadcrumb.Page>\n    </Breadcrumb.Item>\n  </Breadcrumb.List>\n</Breadcrumb.Root>\n```\n\n### Collapsed\nWe provide a `<Breadcrumb.Ellipsis />` component to show a collapsed state when the breadcrumb is too long.\n\n```\n\t<script lang=\"ts\">\n  import * as Breadcrumb from \"$lib/components/ui/breadcrumb/index.js\";\n</script>\n\n<Breadcrumb.Root>\n  <Breadcrumb.List>\n    <Breadcrumb.Item>\n      <Breadcrumb.Link href=\"/\">Home</Breadcrumb.Link>\n    </Breadcrumb.Item>\n    <Breadcrumb.Separator />\n    <Breadcrumb.Item>\n      <Breadcrumb.Ellipsis />\n    </Breadcrumb.Item>\n    <Breadcrumb.Separator />\n    <Breadcrumb.Item>\n      <Breadcrumb.Link href=\"/docs/components\">Components</Breadcrumb.Link>\n    </Breadcrumb.Item>\n    <Breadcrumb.Separator />\n    <Breadcrumb.Item>\n      <Breadcrumb.Page>Breadcrumb</Breadcrumb.Page>\n    </Breadcrumb.Item>\n  </Breadcrumb.List>\n</Breadcrumb.Root>\n```\n\n### Link component\nTo use a custom link component from your routing library, you can use the `asChild` prop on `<Breadcrumb.Link />`.\n\n```\n\t<script lang=\"ts\">\n  import * as Breadcrumb from \"$lib/components/ui/breadcrumb/index.js\";\n</script>\n\n<Breadcrumb.Root>\n  <Breadcrumb.List>\n    <Breadcrumb.Item>\n      <Breadcrumb.Link asChild let:attrs>\n        <a href=\"/\" {...attrs}>Home</a>\n      </Breadcrumb.Link>\n    </Breadcrumb.Item>\n    <Breadcrumb.Separator />\n    <Breadcrumb.Item>\n      <Breadcrumb.Link asChild let:attrs>\n        <a href=\"/components\" {...attrs}>Components</a>\n      </Breadcrumb.Link>\n    </Breadcrumb.Item>\n    <Breadcrumb.Separator />\n    <Breadcrumb.Item>\n      <Breadcrumb.Page>Breadcrumb</Breadcrumb.Page>\n    </Breadcrumb.Item>\n  </Breadcrumb.List>\n</Breadcrumb.Root>\n```\n\n### Responsive\nHere's an example of a responsive breadcrumb that composes `<Breadcrumb.Item />` with `<Breadcrumb.Ellipsis />`, `<DropdownMenu />`, and `<Drawer />`.\nIt displays a dropdown on desktop and a drawer on mobile.\n\n```\n\t<script lang=\"ts\">\n  import { mediaQuery } from \"svelte-legos\";\n  import * as Breadcrumb from \"$lib/components/ui/breadcrumb/index.js\";\n  import * as Drawer from \"$lib/components/ui/drawer/index.js\";\n  import * as DropdownMenu from \"$lib/components/ui/dropdown-menu/index.js\";\n  import { Button } from \"$lib/components/ui/button/index.js\";\n\n  const items = [\\\n    { href: \"#\", label: \"Home\" },\\\n    { href: \"#\", label: \"Documentation\" },\\\n    { href: \"#\", label: \"Building Your Application\" },\\\n    { href: \"#\", label: \"Data Fetching\" },\\\n    { label: \"Caching and Revalidating\" }\\\n  ];\n\n  const ITEMS_TO_DISPLAY = 3;\n\n  let open = false;\n\n  const isDesktop = mediaQuery(\"(min-width: 768px)\");\n</script>\n\n<Breadcrumb.Root>\n  <Breadcrumb.List>\n    <Breadcrumb.Item>\n      <Breadcrumb.Link href={items[0].href}>\n        {items[0].label}\n      </Breadcrumb.Link>\n    </Breadcrumb.Item>\n    <Breadcrumb.Separator />\n    {#if items.length > ITEMS_TO_DISPLAY}\n      <Breadcrumb.Item>\n        {#if $isDesktop}\n          <DropdownMenu.Root bind:open>\n            <DropdownMenu.Trigger\n              class=\"flex items-center gap-1\"\n              aria-label=\"Toggle menu\"\n            >\n

<DropdownMenu.Item href={item.href ? item.href : \"#\"}>\n                  {item.label}\n                </DropdownMenu.Item>\n              {/each}\n            </DropdownMenu.Content>\n

{"text": "System: You are a helpful shadcn-svelte expert.\n\nUser: What are some tips for using Breadcrumb in shadcn-svelte effectively?\n\nAssistant: Great question! Here are some tips to keep in mind:\n\nUse a custom component in the `<slot>` of `<Breadcrumb.Separator />` to create a custom separator.\n\nYou can compose `<Breadcrumb.Item />` with a `<DropdownMenu />` to create a dropdown in the breadcrumb.\n\nTo use a custom link component from your routing library, you can use the `asChild` prop on `<Breadcrumb.Link />`.\n\nFor responsive design, consider using `<Breadcrumb.Ellipsis />`, `<DropdownMenu />`, and `<Drawer />` to manage long breadcrumb paths.\n\nStick to these, and you'll avoid a lot of headaches!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/docs/components/breadcrumb", "title": "Breadcrumb", "description": "Displays the path to the current resource using a hierarchy of links.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 3, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 22:04:58", "type": "best_practices", "page_metadata": {"twitter:image": "https://shadcn-svelte.com/og.png", "ogUrl": "https://shadcn-svelte.com/docs/components/breadcrumb", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "author": "huntabyte", "language": "en", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "twitter:site": "https://shadcn-svelte.com", "twitter:image:alt": "shadcn-svelte", "ogDescription": "Beautifully designed components built with Melt UI and Tailwind CSS.", "og:image": "https://shadcn-svelte.com/og.png", "keywords": "shadcn,Svelte,SvelteKit,Svelte Components,TailwindCSS,Melt UI,Bit UI", "title": "Breadcrumb - shadcn-svelte", "twitter:creator": "huntabyte", "og:image:alt": "shadcn-svelte", "og:type": "article", "favicon": "https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/favicon.ico", "ogSiteName": "shadcn-svelte", "og:site_name": "shadcn-svelte", "og:url": "https://shadcn-svelte.com/docs/components/breadcrumb", "og:image:width": "1200", "ogTitle": "Breadcrumb - shadcn-svelte", "og:locale": "EN_US", "og:image:height": "630", "ogImage": "https://shadcn-svelte.com/og.png", "twitter:description": "Beautifully designed components built with Melt UI and Tailwind CSS.", "og:description": "Beautifully designed components built with Melt UI and Tailwind CSS.", "description": "Beautifully designed components built with Melt UI and Tailwind CSS.", "og:title": "Breadcrumb - shadcn-svelte", "ogLocale": "EN_US", "twitter:title": "Breadcrumb - shadcn-svelte", "scrapeId": "382a823c-2d37-415e-8432-3127011980c3", "sourceURL": "https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/docs/components/breadcrumb", "url": "https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/docs/components/breadcrumb", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful shadcn-svelte expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Formsnap & Superforms is in shadcn-svelte?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Formsnap & Superforms in shadcn-svelte.\n\n# Formsnap & Superforms\n\nBuilding forms with Formsnap, Superforms, & Zod.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Features\n\nThe `Form` components offered by `shadcn-svelte` are wrappers around `formsnap` & `sveltekit-superforms` which provide a few things:\n\n- Composable components for building forms.\n- Form field components for scoping form state.\n- Form validation using [Zod](https://zod.dev/) or any other validation library supported by [Superforms](https://superforms.rocks/).\n- Applies the correct `aria` attributes to form fields based on states.\n- Enables you to easily use various components like [Select](https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/docs/components/select), [RadioGroup](https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/docs/components/radio-group), [Switch](https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/docs/components/switch), [Checkbox](https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/docs/components/checkbox) and other form components with forms.\n\nIf you aren't familiar with [Superforms](https://superforms.rocks/) & [Formsnap](https://formsnap.dev/), you should check out their documentation first, as this guide assumes you have a basic understanding of how they work together.\n\n## Anatomy\n\n```\n\t<form>\n  <Form.Field>\n    <Form.Control>\n      <Form.Label />\n      <!-- Any Form input component -->\n    </Form.Control>\n    <Form.Description />\n    <Form.FieldErrors />\n  </Form.Field>\n</form>\n\n```\n\n## Example\n\n```\n\t<form method=\"POST\" use:enhance>\n  <Form.Field {form} name=\"email\">\n    <Form.Control let:attrs>\n      <Form.Label>Email</Form.Label>\n      <Input {...attrs} bind:value={$formData.email} />\n    </Form.Control>\n    <Form.Description />\n    <Form.FieldErrors />\n  </Form.Field>\n</form>\n\n```\n\n## Installation\n\n```\n\tnpx  shadcn-svelte@latest add form\n\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Create a form schema\n\nDefine the shape of your form using a Zod schema. You can read more about using Zod in the [Zod documentation](https://zod.dev/).
