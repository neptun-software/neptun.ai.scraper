{"text": "System: You are a helpful nektosact expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what act - User Guide | Manual | Docs | Documentation is in nektosact?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain act - User Guide | Manual | Docs | Documentation in nektosact.\n\n# act - User Guide | Manual | Docs | Documentation\n\nThis documentation provides a comprehensive guide on how to install and use the `act` tool, which depends on Docker to run workflows in containers.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Introduction\n\n`act` depends on `docker` (exactly Docker Engine API) to run workflows in containers. As long you don't require container isolation, you can run selected (e.g. windows or macOS) jobs directly on your System, see [Runners](https://nektosact.com/usage/runners.html). In the latter case you don't need to have docker installed or running.\n\n## Installation Instructions\n\nIf you are using macOS, please be sure to follow the steps outlined in [Docker Docs for how to install Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/).\n\nIf you are using Windows, please follow steps for [installing Docker Desktop on Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/).\n\nIf you are using Linux, you will need to [install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).\n\n## Using act with Remote Docker Engine\n\nTo use `act` with remote Docker Engine API compatible host, see [Custom container engine](https://nektosact.com/usage/custom_engine.html) `act` is currently not supported with `podman` or other container backends (it might work, but it's not guaranteed). Please see [#303](https://github.com/nektos/act/issues/303) for updates.\n\n## Installation via Command Line\n\nYou can easily install a pre-built `act` executable on any system with `bash` via below commandline:\n\n```shell\ncurl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nektos/act/master/install.sh | sudo bash\n```\n\n⚠ _Script can't install non-released versions_ ⚠\n\n## Prebuilt Executables\n\nPrebuilt executables for multiple platforms are available via [latest release](https://github.com/nektos/act/releases/latest) page. You can unpack and run them in terminal specifying full path or add them to one of the paths included in `PATH` environment variable.\n\n- [macOS 64-bit (Apple Silicon)](https://github.com/nektos/act/releases/latest/download/act_Darwin_arm64.tar.gz)\n- [macOS 64-bit (Intel)](https://github.com/nektos/act/releases/latest/download/act_Darwin_x86_64.tar.gz)\n- [Linux 64-bit (arm64/aarch64)](https://github.com/nektos/act/releases/latest/download/act_Linux_arm64.tar.gz)\n- [Linux 32-bit (armv6)](https://github.com/nektos/act/releases/latest/download/act_Linux_armv6.tar.gz)\n- [Linux 32-bit (armv7)](https://github.com/nektos/act/releases/latest/download/act_Linux_armv7.tar.gz)\n- [Linux 32-bit (i386/x86)](https://github.com/nektos/act/releases/latest/download/act_Linux_i386.tar.gz)\n- [Linux 64-bit (amd64/x86_64)](https://github.com/nektos/act/releases/latest/download/act_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz)\n- [Windows 64-bit (arm64/aarch64)](https://github.com/nektos/act/releases/latest/download/act_Windows_arm64.zip)\n- [Windows 32-bit (armv7)](https://github.com/nektos/act/releases/latest/download/act_Windows_armv7.zip)\n- [Windows 32-bit (i386/x86)](https://github.com/nektos/act/releases/latest/download/act_Windows_i386.zip)\n- [Windows 64-bit (amd64/x86_64)](https://github.com/nektos/act/releases/latest/download/act_Windows_x86_64.zip)\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nektosact.com/installation", "title": "act - User Guide | Manual | Docs | Documentation", "description": "This documentation provides a comprehensive guide on how to install and use the `act` tool, which depends on Docker to run workflows in containers.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 5, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 02:54:08", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"description": "", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "language": "en", "title": "Installation - act - User Guide | Manual | Docs | Documentation", "favicon": "https://nektosact.com/favicon.svg", "scrapeId": "ca3a2190-2ca3-4e71-ba3e-c3f881dfa1f1", "sourceURL": "https://nektosact.com/installation", "url": "https://nektosact.com/installation/", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful nektosact expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what act - User Guide | Manual | Docs | Documentation is in nektosact?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain act - User Guide | Manual | Docs | Documentation in nektosact.\n\n# act - User Guide | Manual | Docs | Documentation\n\nThis documentation provides a comprehensive guide on how to use the `act` tool for running GitHub Actions locally, including event support, workflow management, and configuration options.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Basic Event Support\n\n`act` has basic event support, it will try to get as much information from local repository as possible, although this might be not enough for certain event types. Running `act` without any event name specified will run with event `push`. For a list of event names, please see events that trigger workflows.\n\n## Event Commands\n\n- `push`: Runs all workflows with `push` event\n\n```shell\nact push\n```\n\n- `pull_request`: \n\n```shell\nact pull_request\n```\n\n- `schedule`: \n\n```shell\nact schedule\n```\n\nTo list all workflows for a given event, use `-l`/ `--list`:\n\n```shell\nact -l pull_request\n```\n\n## Simulating Events\n\nIf your workflow relies on passed event properties, you will have to provide the required properties in the event file, example:\n\nTo partially simulate `pull_request` event, you to provide at least `head_ref` and `base_ref`. This values can be later accessed via `${{ github.event.pull_request.<...> }}`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"pull_request\": {\n    \"head\": {\n      \"ref\": \"sample-head-ref\"\n    },\n    \"base\": {\n      \"ref\": \"sample-base-ref\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTo partially simulate `push` event with a tag, you need to provide `ref` which will be accessible via `${{ github.event.ref }}`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ref\": \"refs/tags/this-is-a-tag\"\n}\n```\n\n## Running Specific Workflows\n\nBy default `act` will run **all** workflows in `.github/workflows`. You can override that behaviour with `-W`/ `--workflows` flag by specifying the directory containing workflow files.\n\n```shell\nact -W '.github/workflows/'\n```\n\nThis example will run **all jobs** in **all workflows** in the directory `.github/workflows` but only if the trigger event is `push`.\n\n## Running Specific Jobs\n\nYou can also specify the exact workflow file to run\n\n```shell\nact -W '.github/workflows/checks.yml'\n```\n\nThis example will run **all jobs** in `.github/workflows/checks.yml` workflow file but only if its trigger event is `push`.\n\n## Job Execution\n\nBy default `act` will run **all jobs** in **all workflows** that are triggered by `push` event\n\n```shell\nact -j 'test'\n```\n\nThis example will run **all jobs** named `test` in **all workflows** that trigger on `push` event.\n\n## Configuration with .actrc\n\nAct can be configured using `.actrc` files. All found arguments will be parsed and appended to a list, in order of: .actrc as per the XDG spec, .actrc in HOME directory, .actrc in invocation directory, cli arguments.\n\nFormat: One argument per line, no comments supported.\n\nExample:\n\n```shell\n--container-architecture=linux/amd64\n--action-offline-mode\n```\n\n## Using Repository Variables\n\nTo run `act` with repository variables that are accessible inside the workflow via `${{ vars.VARIABLE }}`, you can enter them interactively or load them from a file. The following options are available for providing github repository variables:\n\n- `act --var VARIABLE=somevalue` - use `somevalue` as the value for `VARIABLE`.\n- `act --var-file my.variables` - load variables values from `my.variables` file.\n- The variables file format is the same as `.env` format.\n\n## Using Secrets\n\nTo run `act` with secrets, you can enter them interactively, supply them as environment variables or load them from a file. The following options are available for providing secrets:\n\n- `act -s MY_SECRET=somevalue` - use `somevalue` as the value for `MY_SECRET`.\n- `act -s MY_SECRET` - check for an environment variable named `MY_SECRET` and use it if it exists. If the environment variable is not defined, prompt the user for a value. **This is recommended way of typing/pasting a secret into terminal, as `act` will provide secure input prompt for you to type/paste your secret which will not be saved in your shell history file.**\n- `act --secret-file my.secrets` - load secrets values from `my.secrets` file.\n\n## Using GITHUB_TOKEN\n\nGitHub automatically provides a `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret when running workflows inside GitHub. If your workflow fails with an error about `token`, it most likely requires `GITHUB_TOKEN` to be set up. If your workflow depends on this token, you need to create a personal access token and pass it to `act` as a secret:\n\n```bash\nact -s GITHUB_TOKEN=[insert token or leave blank and omit equals for secure input]\n```\n\nIf GitHub CLI is installed, the `gh auth token` command can be used to automatically pass the token to act\n\n```bash\nact -s GITHUB_TOKEN=\"$(gh auth token)\"\n```\n\n## Environment Variables and .env Files\n\n.env and .secrets files are using Ruby's gem `dotenv` format through `godotenv` library\n\nExample:\n\n```shell\nexport MY_ENV='value'\nPRIV_KEY=\"---...\\nrandom text\\n...---\"\nJSON=\"{\\n\\\"name\\\": \\\"value\\\"\\n}\"\nSOME_VAR=SOME_VALUE\n```\n\n## Skipping Jobs\n\nYou cannot use the `env` context in job level if conditions, but you can add a custom event property to the `github` context. You can use this method also on step level if conditions.\n\n```yml\nyaml\non: push\njobs:\n  deploy:\n    if: ${{ !github.event.act }} # skip during local actions testing\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - run: exit 0\n```\n\n## Example Workflow File\n\nExample workflow file\n\n```yaml\nyaml\non:\n  workflow_dispatch:\n    inputs:\n      NAME:\n        description: \"A random input name for the workflow\"\n        type: string\n      SOME_VALUE:\n        description: \"Some other input to pass\"\n        type: string\njobs:\n  test:\n    name: Test\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Test with inputs\n        run: |\n          echo \"Hello ${{ github.event.inputs.NAME }} and ${{ github.event.inputs.SOME_VALUE }}!\"\n```\n\n## Matrix Options\n\nYou can selectively choose a subset of matrix options to run by specifying the `--matrix` flag. It will only run those matrix configurations which include your specified values.\n\n## Offline Mode\n\nIf you want to speed up running act and using cached actions and container images you can enable this mode.\n\n```sh\nact --action-offline-mode\n```\n\nor a `.actrc` file in your cwd like\n\n```shell\n--action-offline-mode\n```\n\n## Artifacts Server\n\nCurrently the artifacts server is not started automatically with act, this means the following env variables are blank by default.\n- `ACTIONS_RUNTIME_URL`\n- `ACTIONS_RUNTIME_TOKEN`\n- `ACTIONS_RESULTS_URL`\n\nto enable this feature use the cli flag `--artifact-server-path $PWD/.artifacts`.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nektosact.com/usage/index.html", "title": "act - User Guide | Manual | Docs | Documentation", "description": "This documentation provides a comprehensive guide on how to use the `act` tool for running GitHub Actions locally, including event support, workflow management, and configuration options.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 16, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 02:57:54", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "favicon": "https://nektosact.com/favicon.svg", "language": "en", "description": "", "title": "Usage guide - act - User Guide | Manual | Docs | Documentation", "scrapeId": "72e874f5-bac7-4843-b83d-2b0e7740307e", "sourceURL": "https://nektosact.com/usage/index.html", "url": "https://nektosact.com/usage/index.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

If your workflow depends on this token, you need to create a personal access token and pass it to `act` as a secret:\n\n```bash\nact -s GITHUB_TOKEN=[insert token or leave blank and omit equals for secure input]\n```\n\nIf GitHub CLI is installed, the `gh auth token` command can be used to automatically pass the token to act\n\n```bash\nact -s GITHUB_TOKEN=\"$(gh auth token)\"\n```.\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nektosact.com/usage/index.html", "title": "act - User Guide | Manual | Docs | Documentation", "description": "This documentation provides a comprehensive guide on how to use the `act` tool for running GitHub Actions locally, including event support, workflow management, and configuration options.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 16, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 02:57:54", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "favicon": "https://nektosact.com/favicon.svg", "language": "en", "description": "", "title": "Usage guide - act - User Guide | Manual | Docs | Documentation", "scrapeId": "72e874f5-bac7-4843-b83d-2b0e7740307e", "sourceURL": "https://nektosact.com/usage/index.html", "url": "https://nektosact.com/usage/index.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful nektosact expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what act - User Guide | Manual | Docs | Documentation is in nektosact?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain act - User Guide | Manual | Docs | Documentation in nektosact.\n\n# act - User Guide | Manual | Docs | Documentation\n\nThis documentation provides guidance on using the act tool to run GitHub Actions workflows locally using Docker containers.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Introduction\n\nGitHub Actions offers managed virtual environments for running workflows. In order for `act` to run your workflows locally, it must run a container for the runner defined in your workflow file.\n\n## Docker Images for GitHub Runners\n\nHere are the images that `act` uses for each runner type and size:\n\n| GitHub Runner | Micro Docker Image | Medium Docker Image | Large Docker Image |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `ubuntu-latest` | [`node:16-buster-slim`](https://hub.docker.com/_/buildpack-deps) | [`catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest`](https://github.com/catthehacker/docker_images) | [`catthehacker/ubuntu:full-latest`](https://github.com/catthehacker/docker_images) |\n| `ubuntu-22.04` | [`node:16-bullseye-slim`](https://hub.docker.com/_/buildpack-deps) | [`catthehacker/ubuntu:act-22.04`](https://github.com/catthehacker/docker_images) | [`catthehacker/ubuntu:full-22.04`](https://github.com/catthehacker/docker_images) |\n| `ubuntu-20.04` | [`node:16-buster-slim`](https://hub.docker.com/_/buildpack-deps) | [`catthehacker/ubuntu:act-20.04`](https://github.com/catthehacker/docker_images) | [`catthehacker/ubuntu:full-20.04`](https://github.com/catthehacker/docker_images) |\n| `ubuntu-18.04` | [`node:16-buster-slim`](https://hub.docker.com/_/buildpack-deps) | [`catthehacker/ubuntu:act-18.04`](https://github.com/catthehacker/docker_images) | [`catthehacker/ubuntu:full-18.04`](https://github.com/catthehacker/docker_images) |\n\n## Running on Windows and macOS\n\nIf you want to run Windows and macOS based platforms and you are running act within that specific environment you can opt out of docker and run them directly on your host system.\n\n## Examples\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n```sh\nact -P ubuntu-latest=-self-hosted\nact -P windows-latest=-self-hosted\nact -P macos-latest=-self-hosted\n```\n\n## Limitations\n\nThese default images do **not** contain **all** the tools that GitHub Actions offers by default in their runners. Many things can work improperly or not at all while running those images. Additionally, some software might still not work even if installed properly, since GitHub Actions are running in fully virtualized machines while `act` is using Docker containers (e.g. Docker does not support running `systemd`).\n\n## Creating Issues\n\nIn case of any problems please create issue in respective repository (issues with `act` in this repository, issues with `nektos/act-environments-ubuntu:18.04` in `nektos/act-environments` and issues with any image from user `catthehacker` in `catthehacker/docker_images`).\n\n## Using nektos/act-environments\n\nIf you need an environment that works just like the corresponding GitHub runner then consider using an image provided by `nektos/act-environments`:\n\n- [`nektos/act-environments-ubuntu:18.04`](https://hub.docker.com/r/nektos/act-environments-ubuntu/tags) - built from the Packer file GitHub uses in [actions/virtual-environments](https://github.com/actions/runner).\n\n:warning: :elephant: `*** WARNING - this image is >18GB 😱***`\n\n- [`catthehacker/ubuntu:full-*`](https://github.com/catthehacker/docker_images/pkgs/container/ubuntu) - filesystem dump of the Runners provided by GitHub, see [`ChristopherHX/runner-image-blobs`](https://github.com/ChristopherHX/runner-image-blobs) or [`catthehacker/docker_images`](https://github.com/catthehacker/docker_images) for more information.\n\n## Using a Different Image\n\nTo use a different image for the runner, use the `-P` option.\n\n## Changing Docker Image Example\n\nIf your workflow uses `ubuntu-18.04`, consider below line as an example for changing Docker image used to run that workflow:\n\n```sh\nact -P ubuntu-18.04=nektos/act-environments-ubuntu:18.04\n```\n\n## Multiple Platforms Example\n\nIf you use multiple platforms in your workflow, you have to specify them to change which image is used. For example, if your workflow uses `ubuntu-18.04`, `ubuntu-16.04` and `ubuntu-latest`, specify all platforms like below:\n\n```sh\nact -P ubuntu-18.04=nektos/act-environments-ubuntu:18.04 -P ubuntu-latest=ubuntu:latest -P ubuntu-16.04=node:16-buster-slim\n```\n\n## Pull Flag\n\nThe `--pull` flag is set to true by default due to a breaking on older default docker images. This would pull the docker image every time act is executed. Set `--pull` to false if a local docker image is needed.\n\n## Offline Mode\n\nAlternatively turn on offline mode:\n\n```sh\nact --action-offline-mode\n```\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nektosact.com/usage/runners.html", "title": "act - User Guide | Manual | Docs | Documentation", "description": "This documentation provides guidance on using the act tool to run GitHub Actions workflows locally using Docker containers.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 12, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 02:58:25", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"title": "Runners - act - User Guide | Manual | Docs | Documentation", "description": "", "language": "en", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "favicon": "https://nektosact.com/favicon.svg", "scrapeId": "2472e3ad-f658-4895-9a4c-d32ff36755e2", "sourceURL": "https://nektosact.com/usage/runners.html", "url": "https://nektosact.com/usage/runners.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful nektosact expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what act - User Guide | Manual | Docs | Documentation is in nektosact?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain act - User Guide | Manual | Docs | Documentation in nektosact.\n\n# act - User Guide | Manual | Docs | Documentation\n\nThis documentation provides a comprehensive guide on how to install and use the `act` tool, which depends on Docker to run workflows in containers.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Introduction\n\n`act` depends on `docker` (exactly Docker Engine API) to run workflows in containers. As long you don't require container isolation, you can run selected (e.g. windows or macOS) jobs directly on your System, see [Runners](https://nektosact.com/usage/runners.html). In the latter case you don't need to have docker installed or running.\n\n## Installation Instructions\n\nIf you are using macOS, please be sure to follow the steps outlined in [Docker Docs for how to install Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/).\n\nIf you are using Windows, please follow steps for [installing Docker Desktop on Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/).\n\nIf you are using Linux, you will need to [install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).\n\n## Using act with Remote Docker Engine\n\nTo use `act` with remote Docker Engine API compatible host, see [Custom container engine](https://nektosact.com/usage/custom_engine.html) `act` is currently not supported with `podman` or other container backends (it might work, but it's not guaranteed). Please see [#303](https://github.com/nektos/act/issues/303) for updates.\n\n## Installation via Command Line\n\nYou can easily install a pre-built `act` executable on any system with `bash` via below commandline\n\n```shell\ncurl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nektos/act/master/install.sh | sudo bash\n```\n\n⚠ _Script can't install non-released versions_ ⚠\n\n## Prebuilt Executables\n\nPrebuilt executables for multiple platforms are available via [latest release](https://github.com/nektos/act/releases/latest) page.
