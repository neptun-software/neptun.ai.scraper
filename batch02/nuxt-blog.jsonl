{"text": "System: You are a helpful nuxt-blog expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Announcing Nuxt 3.0 is in nuxt-blog?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Announcing Nuxt 3.0 in nuxt-blog.\n\n# Announcing Nuxt 3.0\n\nWe are thrilled to announce the first stable version of Nuxt 3.0.0, a modern rewrite of the Nuxt framework based on Vite, Vue3, and Nitro with first-class TypeScript support.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Announcing Nuxt 3.0 stable\n\nWe are thrilled to announce the first stable version of Nuxt 3.0.0 ‚ú®\n\nNuxt 3 is a modern rewrite of the Nuxt framework based on Vite, Vue3, and Nitro with first-class TypeScript support and the result of more than two years of research, community feedback, innovation, and experiment to make a pleasant full-stack Developer Experience for Vue development to everyone.\n\n## API Stability\n\nNuxt 3.0.0 comes with a stable, production-ready API and 50+ supported modules built using Nuxt Kit by the community and Nuxt team.\n\nAll composables, filesystem conventions, and configurations are guaranteed to be backward compatible with Nuxt 3.0.0. Due to the nature of the meta-frameworks, some changes happen when we upgrade the underlying dependencies (vite, rollup, and nitropack). Thanks to the new Nuxt Kit and Schema tools, such upgrades will be backward compatible as long as you are using documented features. Kit and Schema also guarantee better future compatibility. This makes it faster for us to iterate and plan the next major versions of Nuxt.\n\n## The browser and Node.js support\n\nNuxt 3 officially supports evergreen browsers only. The \"core browser set\" is what we (And web.dev team) believe most developers need to support most of the time in the absence of specific constraints. It takes into account usage numbers, developer expectations, and existing support in the ecosystem. The core browser set targets the 2 most recent major versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Edge on a monthly basis and Safari on a yearly basis.\n\nOn the server side, Nuxt 3 supports Node.js 14, 16, 18, and 19 at the moment. We encourage everyone to use the latest LTS releases of Node.js, we push them once widely adopted by major deployment platforms. This means we keep supporting Node.js versions as long as they are supported by the Node.js team on a rolling basis in non-major releases of Nuxt. Since 14.x is being end-of-life soon, we highly encourage you to update to the latest 18.x whenever possible.\n\n## We Love Community\n\nNuxt wouldn‚Äôt be possible today without an amazing community making amazing modules, feedback, and contributions every day. Check our Community Documentation to be involved!\n\n## To the Future\n\nReleasing Nuxt 3 is a big milestone for us and opens a future-proof basis for new ideas and trust for the users to build their enterprise projects with Nuxt 3.\n\nServer Component Islands, WebSocket layer, new Deployment presets, improved CLI and DevTools and Testing infra are a few to mention.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful nuxt-blog expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Nuxt 3.5 is in nuxt-blog?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Nuxt 3.5 in nuxt-blog.\n\n# Nuxt 3.5\n\nNuxt 3.5.0 is out, bringing Vue 3.3, new defaults, interactive server components, typed pages, environment config - and much more.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## ‚ö°Ô∏è Vue 3.3 released\n\nVue 3.3 has been released, with lots of exciting features, particularly around type support.\n\n- new `defineOptions` macro\n- 'generic' components\n- typed slots and using external types in defineProps\n- ... and more\n\nThis also brings a significant improvement to data fetching when navigating between nested pages ( [#20777](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/20777)), thanks to [@antfu](https://github.com/antfu) and [@baiwusanyu-c](https://github.com/baiwusanyu-c).\n\nRead **[the full release announcement](https://blog.vuejs.org/posts/vue-3-3)** for more details.\n\n## üôå Nitropack v2.4\n\nWe've been working on lots of improvements to Nitro and these have landed already in Nitro v2.4 - you may already have this upgrade, which contains a lot of bug fixes, updates to the module worker format for Cloudflare, Vercel KV support and more.\n\nOne note: if you're deploying to Vercel or Netlify and want to benefit from incremental static regeneration, you should now update your route rules:\n\n```\nrouteRules: {\n--  '/blog/**': { swr: 3000 },\n++  '/blog/**': { isr: 3000 },\n}\n```\n\nRead **[the full release notes](https://github.com/unjs/nitro/releases/tag/v2.4.0)**.\n\n## üíñ Rich JSON payloads\n\n**Rich JSON payload serialisation** is now enabled by default ( [#19205](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/19205), [#20770](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/20770)). This is both faster and allows serialising complex objects in the payload passed from the Nuxt server to client (and also when extracting payload data for prerendered sites).\n\nThis now means that **various rich JS types are supported out-of-the-box**: regular expressions, dates, Map and Set and BigInt as well as NuxtError - and Vue-specific objects like `ref`, `reactive`, `shallowRef` and `shallowReactive`.\n\nYou can find [an example](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/blob/main/test/fixtures/basic/pages/json-payload.vue) in our test suite.\n\nThis is all possible due to [Rich-Harris/devalue#58](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/devalue/pull/58). For a long time, Nuxt has been using our own fork of devalue owing to issues serialising Errors and other non-POJO objects, but we now have transitioned back to the original.\n\nYou can even register your own custom types with a new object-syntax Nuxt plugin:\n\nplugins/custom-payload-type.ts\n\n```\nexport default definePayloadPlugin(() => {\n  definePayloadReducer('BlinkingText', data => data === '<original-blink>' && '_')\n  definePayloadReviver('BlinkingText', () => '<revivified-blink>')\n})\n```\n\nYou can read more about how this works [here](https://github.com/rich-harris/devalue#custom-types).\n\n## üõù Interactive server components\n\nThis feature should be considered highly experimental, but thanks to some great work from @huang-julien we now support interactive content within server components via _slots_ ( [#20284](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/20284)).\n\nYou can follow the server component roadmap at [#19772](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/issues/19772).\n\n## ‚è∞ Environment config\n\nYou can now configure fully typed, per-environment overrides in your `nuxt.config`:\n\n```\nexport default defineNuxtConfig({\n  $production: {\n    routeRules: {\n      '/**': { isr: true }\n    }\n  },\n  $development: {\n    //\n  }\n})\n```\n\nIf you're authoring layers, you can also use the `$meta` key to provide metadata that you or the consumers of your layer might use.\n\nRead more [about per-environment overrides](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/20329).\n\n## üí™ Fully typed pages\n\nYou can benefit from fully typed routing within your Nuxt app via this experimental integration with [unplugin-vue-router](https://github.com/posva/unplugin-vue-router) - thanks to some great work from [@posva](https://github.com/posva)!\n\nOut of the box, this will enable typed usage of [`navigateTo`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/utils/navigate-to), [`<NuxtLink>`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/components/nuxt-link), `router.push()` and more.\n\nYou can even get typed params within a page by using `const route = useRoute('route-name')`.\n\nEnable this feature directly in your `nuxt.config`:\n\nnuxt.config.ts\n\n```\nexport default defineNuxtConfig({\n  experimental: {\n    typedPages: true\n  }\n})\n```\n\n\n## üîé 'Bundler' module resolution\n\nWe now have full support within Nuxt for the `bundler` strategy of [module resolution](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/module-resolution.html).\n\nWe would recommend adopting this if possible. It has type support for subpath exports, for example, but more exactly matches the behaviour of build tools like Vite and Nuxt than `Node16` resolution.\n\nnuxt.config.ts\n\n```\nexport default defineNuxtConfig({\n  typescript: {\n    tsConfig: {\n      compilerOptions: {\n        moduleResolution: 'bundler'\n      }\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\nThis turns on TypeScript's ability to 'follow' Node subpath exports. For example, if a library has a subpath export like `mylib/path` that is mapped to `mylib/dist/path.mjs` then the types for this can be pulled in from `mylib/dist/path.d.ts` rather than requiring the library author to create `mylib/path.d.ts`.\n\n## ‚öóÔ∏è Separate server types\n\nWe plan to improve clarity within your IDE between the 'nitro' and 'vue' part of your app, we've shipped the first part of this via a separate generated `tsconfig.json` for your [`~/server`](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/server) directory ( [#20559](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/20559)).\n\nYou can use by adding an additional `~/server/tsconfig.json` with the following content:\n\n```\n{\n  \"extends\": \"../.nuxt/tsconfig.server.json\"\n}\n```\n\nAlthough right now these values won't be respected when type checking ( `nuxi typecheck`), you should get better type hints in your IDE.\n\n## üíÄ Deprecations\n\nAlthough we have not typed or documented the `build.extend` hook from Nuxt 2, we have been calling it within the webpack builder. We are now explicitly deprecating this and will remove it in a future minor version.\n\n## ‚úÖ Upgrading\n\nAs usual, our recommendation for upgrading is to run:\n\n```\nnpx nuxi upgrade --force\n```\n\nThis will refresh your lockfile as well, and ensures that you pull in updates from other dependencies that Nuxt relies on, particularly in the unjs ecosystem.\n\n## üìÉ Full changelog\n\nRead the full release note on [https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/releases/tag/v3.5.0](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/releases/tag/v3.5.0)\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-5", "title": "Nuxt 3.5", "description": "Nuxt 3.5.0 is out, bringing Vue 3.3, new defaults, interactive server components, typed pages, environment config - and much more.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 11, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 00:57:42", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:image:height": "600", "twitter:site": "nuxt_js", "description": "Nuxt 3.5.0 is out, bringing Vue 3.3, new defaults, interactive server components, typed pages, environment config - and much more.", "title": "Nuxt 3.5 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "ogSiteName": "Nuxt", "twitter:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3-5.png", "ogImage": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3-5.png", "ogTitle": "Nuxt 3.5 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "og:image:type": "image/png", "twitter:image:src": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3-5.png", "og:type": "website", "ogDescription": "Nuxt 3.5.0 is out, bringing Vue 3.3, new defaults, interactive server components, typed pages, environment config - and much more.", "og:description": "Nuxt 3.5.0 is out, bringing Vue 3.3, new defaults, interactive server components, typed pages, environment config - and much more.", "twitter:image:width": "1200", "language": "en", "favicon": "https://nuxt.com/icon.png", "og:title": "Nuxt 3.5 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "og:site_name": "Nuxt", "theme-color": "#020420", "og:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3-5.png", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:image:width": "1200", "twitter:image:height": "600", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "scrapeId": "180c9fbb-69f3-4d4a-b8ff-1c3bd2b71042", "sourceURL": "https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-5", "url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-5", "statusCode": 200}}}

For example, if a library has a subpath export like `mylib/path` that is mapped to `mylib/dist/path.mjs` then the types for this can be pulled in from `mylib/dist/path.d.ts` rather than requiring the library author to create `mylib/path.d.ts`..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-5", "title": "Nuxt 3.5", "description": "Nuxt 3.5.0 is out, bringing Vue 3.3, new defaults, interactive server components, typed pages, environment config - and much more.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 11, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 00:57:42", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"og:image:height": "600", "twitter:site": "nuxt_js", "description": "Nuxt 3.5.0 is out, bringing Vue 3.3, new defaults, interactive server components, typed pages, environment config - and much more.", "title": "Nuxt 3.5 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "ogSiteName": "Nuxt", "twitter:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3-5.png", "ogImage": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3-5.png", "ogTitle": "Nuxt 3.5 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "og:image:type": "image/png", "twitter:image:src": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3-5.png", "og:type": "website", "ogDescription": "Nuxt 3.5.0 is out, bringing Vue 3.3, new defaults, interactive server components, typed pages, environment config - and much more.", "og:description": "Nuxt 3.5.0 is out, bringing Vue 3.3, new defaults, interactive server components, typed pages, environment config - and much more.", "twitter:image:width": "1200", "language": "en", "favicon": "https://nuxt.com/icon.png", "og:title": "Nuxt 3.5 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "og:site_name": "Nuxt", "theme-color": "#020420", "og:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3-5.png", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:image:width": "1200", "twitter:image:height": "600", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "scrapeId": "180c9fbb-69f3-4d4a-b8ff-1c3bd2b71042", "sourceURL": "https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-5", "url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-5", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful nuxt-blog expert.\n\nUser: What are some tips for using Nuxt 3.5 in nuxt-blog effectively?\n\nAssistant: Great question! Here are some tips to keep in mind:\n\nIf deploying to Vercel or Netlify, update your route rules for incremental static regeneration.\n\nConsider adopting the 'bundler' strategy of module resolution for better compatibility with build tools.\n\nUse fully typed pages for better type safety and developer experience.\n\nStick to these, and you'll avoid a lot of headaches!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-5", "title": "Nuxt 3.5", "description": "Nuxt 3.5.0 is out, bringing Vue 3.3, new defaults, interactive server components, typed pages, environment config - and much more.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 11, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 00:57:42", "type": "best_practices", "page_metadata": {"og:image:height": "600", "twitter:site": "nuxt_js", "description": "Nuxt 3.5.0 is out, bringing Vue 3.3, new defaults, interactive server components, typed pages, environment config - and much more.", "title": "Nuxt 3.5 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "ogSiteName": "Nuxt", "twitter:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3-5.png", "ogImage": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3-5.png", "ogTitle": "Nuxt 3.5 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "og:image:type": "image/png", "twitter:image:src": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3-5.png", "og:type": "website", "ogDescription": "Nuxt 3.5.0 is out, bringing Vue 3.3, new defaults, interactive server components, typed pages, environment config - and much more.", "og:description": "Nuxt 3.5.0 is out, bringing Vue 3.3, new defaults, interactive server components, typed pages, environment config - and much more.", "twitter:image:width": "1200", "language": "en", "favicon": "https://nuxt.com/icon.png", "og:title": "Nuxt 3.5 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "og:site_name": "Nuxt", "theme-color": "#020420", "og:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3-5.png", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:image:width": "1200", "twitter:image:height": "600", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "scrapeId": "180c9fbb-69f3-4d4a-b8ff-1c3bd2b71042", "sourceURL": "https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-5", "url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-5", "statusCode": 200}}}
{"text": "System: You are a helpful nuxt-blog expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Nuxt 3.8 is in nuxt-blog?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Nuxt 3.8 in nuxt-blog.\n\n# Nuxt 3.8\n\nNuxt 3.8 is out, bringing built-in DevTools, automatic Nuxt Image install, a new app manifest and much more.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## üíª CLI Improvements\n\nJust to remind you, we're now using [the new Nuxt CLI](https://github.com/nuxt/cli) which is now versioned separately.\n\nYou can now install a module with `nuxi module add <module-name>`\n\nWe now share the same port with the Vite websocket, meaning better support for docker containers in development.\n\nRead the Nuxt CLI `v3.9.0` release notes.\n\n## ‚ú® Built-in Nuxt DevTools\n\nNuxt DevTools v1.0.0 is out and we now think it's ready to be shipped as a direct dependency of Nuxt.\n\nCheck out Nuxt DevTools v1.0 announcement.\n\n## üì∏ Nuxt Image Auto-install\n\n[`<NuxtImg>`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/components/nuxt-img) and [`<NuxtPicture>`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/components/nuxt-picture) first-class built-in components.\n\nWe now auto-installing `@nuxt/image` the first time that they are used ( [#23717](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/23717)).\n\nWe advise using [`@nuxt/image`](https://image.nuxt.com/) if you're using images in your site; it can apply optimisations to make your site more performant.\n\n## üìÇ Deeper Layout Scanning\n\nThis is a behaviour change so do take care with this one.\n\nWe now support scanning layouts within subfolders in [`~/layouts`](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/layouts) in the same way as we do with [`~/components`](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/components).\n\n| File | Layout name |\n| --- | --- |\n| ~/layouts/desktop/default.vue | 'desktop-default' |\n| ~/layouts/desktop-base/base.vue | 'desktop-base' |\n| ~/layouts/desktop/index.vue | 'desktop' |\n\nRead more about **Named Layouts**.\n\n## üìä App Manifest\n\nWe now support a built-in app manifest (see [PR #21641](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/21641)), which generates a manifest at `/_nuxt/builds/meta/<buildId>.json`.\n\nIt enables loading payloads **only for prerendered routes**, if a site is generated with `nuxt generate`, preventing 404s in the console.\n\nIt also enables **client-side route rules**. Only `redirect` route rules is supported for now; they will now redirect when performing client-side navigation.\n\nnuxt.config.tspages/index.vue\n\n```\nexport default defineNuxtConfig({\n  routeRules: {\n    '/about': { redirect: '/about-us' }\n  }\n})\n```\n\nThe app manifest also enables future enhancements including detection of a new deployment by checking `/_nuxt/builds/latest.json`.\n\nYou can **opt-on from this behaviour if you need to** by setting `experimental.appManifest` to `false` in your `nuxt.config` file.\n\n## ü§ù Scope and Context Improvements\n\nWe now define a 'scope' for Nuxt composables executed in plugins ( [#23667](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/23667)), which allows running synchronous cleanup before navigating away from your site, using the Vue [`onScopeDispose`](https://vuejs.org/api/reactivity-advanced.html#onscopedispose) lifecycle method.\n\nThis should fix an edge case with cookies ( [#23697](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/23697)) and also improves memory management such as Pinia stores ( [#23650](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/issues/23650)).\n\nRead more about Vue effect scopes.\n\nWe also now support [**native async context**](https://nodejs.org/api/async_context.html) for the _Vue composition API_ ( [#23526](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/23526)). In case you're unaware, we support native async context on Node and Bun, enabled with [`experimental.asyncContext`](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/going-further/experimental-features#asynccontext).\n\nIf you experience issues with `Nuxt instance unavailable`, enabling this option may solve your issues:\n\nnuxt.config.ts\n\n```\nexport default defineNuxtConfig({\n  experimental: {\n    asyncContext: true\n  }\n})\n```\n\nOnce we have cross-runtime support, we will enable it by default.\n\n## üîó NuxtLink Defaults\n\nYou can define your own [`<NuxtLink>`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/components/nuxt-link) components with the [`defineNuxtLink`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/components/nuxt-link#definenuxtlink-signature) utility.\n\nToday, you can cutomize the options for the built-in [`<NuxtLink>`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/components/nuxt-link), directly in your `nuxt.config` file ( [#23724](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/23724)).\n\nThis can enable you to enforce trailing slash behaviour across your entire site, for example:\n\nnuxt.config.ts\n\n```\nexport default defineNuxtConfig({\n  experimental: {\n    defaults: {\n      nuxtLink: {\n        activeClass: 'nuxt-link-active',\n        trailingSlash: 'append'\n      }\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\n\n## ‚ö°Ô∏è Data Fetching Improvements\n\nWe have two very significant new features for [`useAsyncData`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-async-data) and [`useFetch`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-fetch):\n\n1. You can now set `deep: false` to prevent deep reactivity on the `data` object returned from these composables ( [#23600](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/23600)). It should be a performance improvement if you are returning large arrays or objects. The object will still update when refetched; it just won't trigger reactive effects if you change a property deep within the `data`.\n2. You can now use the `getCachedData` option to handle custom caching for these composables ( [#20747](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/20747))\n\npages/index.vue\n\n```\n<script setup>\nconst nuxtApp = useNuxtApp()\nconst { data } = await useAsyncData(() => { /* fetcher */ }, {\n  // this will not refetch if the key exists in the payload\n  getCachedData: key => nuxtApp.payload.static[key] ?? nuxtApp.payload.data[key]\n})\n</script>\n```\n\nWatch the video from Alexander Lichter about **Client-side caching with getCachedData**.\n\nWe also support configuring some default values for these composables in an app-wide way ( [#23725](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/20747)):\n\nnuxt.config.ts\n\n```\nexport default defineNuxtConfig({\n  experimental: {\n    defaults: {\n      useAsyncData: {\n        deep: false\n      },\n      useFetch: {\n        retry: false,\n        retryDelay: 100,\n        retryStatusCodes: [500],\n        timeout: 100\n      }\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\n\n## üî¢ Layer Improvements\n\nWe now more carefully load layer plugins ( [#22889](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/22889) and [#23148](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/23148)) and middleware ( [#22925](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/22925) and [#23552](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/23552)) in the order of the layers, always loading your own plugins and middleware last. This should mean you can rely on utilities that layers may inject.\n\nAnd probably one of the most significant changes - if you are using remote layers we now clone these within your [`node_modules/`](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/node_modules) folder ( [#109](https://github.com/unjs/c12/pull/109)) so layers can use dependencies with your project. See [`c12` release notes](https://github.com/unjs/c12/releases/tag/v1.5.1) for full details.\n\nWe've also added a test suite to cover these layer resolution changes.\n\n## üò¥ Nightly Release Channel\n\nEvery commit to the `main` branch of Nuxt is automatically deployed to a new release, for easier testing before releases. We've renamed this from the 'edge release channel' to the 'nightly release channel' to avoid confusion with _edge deployments_. And probably also with Microsoft Edge (though I haven't heard that anyone was confused with that one!)\n\n- `nuxt3` is now `nuxt-nightly`\n- `nuxi-edge` is now `nuxi-nightly`\n- `@‚Äãnuxt/kit-edge` is now `@‚Äãnuxt/kit-nightly`\n- ... and so on.\n\nRead more about the **Nighly Release Channel**.\n\n## ‚öóÔ∏è Nitro v2.7\n\nNitro v2.7 has been released with lots of improvements and bug fixes.\n\nüî• One of the most significant is that we now save **40% of bundle size in production** by using native `fetch` supported in Node 18+ ( [#1724](https://github.com/unjs/nitro/pull/1724)). So if possible, we'd recommend you update your Node version to at least 18.\n\nCheck out Nitro v2.7 release note.\n\n## üí™ Type Import Changes\n\nThis is likely to need code changes in your project.\n\nVue requires that type imports be explicit (so that the Vue compiler can correctly optimise and resolve type imports for props and so on). See [core Vue `tsconfig.json`](https://github.com/vuejs/tsconfig/blob/main/tsconfig.json#L30-L33).\n\nWe've therefore taken the decision to turn on `verbatimModuleSyntax` by default in Nuxt projects, which will throw a type error if types are imported without an explicit `type` import. To resolve it you will need to update your imports:\n\n```\n- import { someFunction, SomeOptions } from 'some-library'\n+ import { someFunction } from 'some-library'\n+ import type { SomeOptions } from 'some-library'\n```\n\nYou may also encounter modules in the Nuxt ecosystem that need to be updated; please open an issue for those modules. I'm also very happy to help if you're encountering any problems with this, if you're a module author.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful nuxt-blog expert.\n\nUser: How do I üí™ type import changes in nuxt-blog?\n\nAssistant: To üí™ type import changes in nuxt-blog, here's what you do:\nThis is likely to need code changes in your project.\n\nVue requires that type imports be explicit (so that the Vue compiler can correctly optimise and resolve type imports for props and so on). See [core Vue `tsconfig.json`](https://github.com/vuejs/tsconfig/blob/main/tsconfig.json#L30-L33).\n\nWe've therefore taken the decision to turn on `verbatimModuleSyntax` by default in Nuxt projects, which will throw a type error if types are imported without an explicit `type` import. To resolve it you will need to update your imports:\n\n```\n- import { someFunction, SomeOptions } from 'some-library'\n+ import { someFunction } from 'some-library'\n+ import type { SomeOptions } from 'some-library'\n```\n\nYou may also encounter modules in the Nuxt ecosystem that need to be updated; please open an issue for those modules. I'm also very happy to help if you're encountering any problems with this, if you're a module author. Just tag me and I'll take a look.\n\nIf for whatever reason you need to undo this change in your project you can set the following configuration:\n\nnuxt.config.ts\n\n```\nexport default defineNuxtConfig({\n  typescript: {\n    tsConfig: {\n      compilerOptions: {\n        verbatimModuleSyntax: false\n      }\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\nHowever, we'd recommend only doing that temporarily, as Vue does need this option to be set for best results..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-8", "title": "Nuxt 3.8", "description": "Nuxt 3.8 is out, bringing built-in DevTools, automatic Nuxt Image install, a new app manifest and much more.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 13, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 00:58:38", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"ogTitle": "Nuxt 3.8 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "favicon": "https://nuxt.com/icon.png", "twitter:image:width": "1200", "og:image:width": "1200", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:image:height": "600", "twitter:site": "nuxt_js", "og:image:type": "image/png", "og:type": "website", "og:description": "Nuxt 3.8 is out, bringing built-in DevTools, automatic Nuxt Image install, a new app manifest and much more.", "twitter:image:height": "600", "language": "en", "og:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3.8.png", "ogSiteName": "Nuxt", "og:site_name": "Nuxt", "ogDescription": "Nuxt 3.8 is out, bringing built-in DevTools, automatic Nuxt Image install, a new app manifest and much more.", "title": "Nuxt 3.8 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "ogImage": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3.8.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#020420", "description": "Nuxt 3.8 is out, bringing built-in DevTools, automatic Nuxt Image install, a new app manifest and much more.", "og:title": "Nuxt 3.8 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "twitter:image:src": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3.8.png", "twitter:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3.8.png", "scrapeId": "6ef6bcad-9c45-4115-a9b1-e730fded70c0", "sourceURL": "https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-8", "url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-8", "statusCode": 200}}}

You can also trigger a restart of the Nuxt server with the new `restart` hook ( [#19084](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/19084)).\n\n## üî• Performance improvements\n\nWe've increased static asset maxAge to 1 year as a matter of best practice ( [#19335](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/19335)), and support tree-shaking more of your build ( [#19508](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/19508)).\n\nWe also now support preloading [`<NuxtLink>`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/components/nuxt-link) with a route in object-syntax ( [#19120](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/19120)).\n\nWe also track how long it takes each module you use to perform its setup, and warn if it takes too long. You can see all these values by running your dev server with `DEBUG=1` ( [#18648](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/18648)).\n\n## üêõ Error handling\n\nWe now handle chunk errors by default ( [#19086](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/19086)), meaning if your site updates with a redeploy, **we automatically handle reloading it on navigation**.\n\nTo disable this behavior, set `experimental.emitRouteChunkError` option to `'manual'` and handle it yourself with the new [`reloadNuxtApp`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/utils/reload-nuxt-app) composable. Learn more how we implemented in our [chunk-reload.client.ts plugin](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/blob/main/packages/nuxt/src/app/plugins/chunk-reload.client.ts).\n\n## ‚ö°Ô∏è Head improvements\n\nWe've migrated to use [unhead](https://github.com/unjs/unhead) directly ( [#19519](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/19519)) \n\nThere's also a new [`useHeadSafe`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-head-safe) composable that handles sanitising untrusted user input ( [#19548](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-head-safe)).\n\n## ü™µ Better logging in browser DevTools\n\nWorking with the Chrome DevTools team, we've landed a couple of features across the unjs + Nuxt ecosystem meaning we now have first-class support for hiding Nuxt internal stack traces from logs in your (Chromium-based, for now) browser [#19243](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/19243).\n\n## üí™ Type improvements\n\nTypes for server API routes are now more correct - with non-serialisable types stripped out of the return type ( [unjs/nitro#1002](https://github.com/unjs/nitro/pull/1002)).\n\n## ‚öóÔ∏è Nitro enhancements\n\nThis release comes with Nitro v2.3, which brings lots of improvements of its own. Check out [the release](https://github.com/unjs/nitro/releases/tag/v2.3.0) for more info.\n\n## üõ†Ô∏è Build changes\n\nAs part of moving towards [first-class support for PNP and pnpm support without `--shamefully-hoist`](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/issues/14146), we've dropped support for some internal (deprecated) utilities using CJS resolve patterns ( [#19537](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/19537) and [#19608](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/19608)).\n\n## üó∫Ô∏è Custom config schema (advanced)\n\nWe've been testing out an experimental feature to allow modules and users to extend the Nuxt config schema ( [#15592](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/issues/15592)), and we've now enabled this by default ( [#19172](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/19172)).\n\n## Changelog\n\nSee the full changelog by [comparing the changes](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/compare/v3.2.3...v3.3.0) or checkout the [release on GitHub](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/releases/tag/v3.3.0).\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-3", "title": "Nuxt 3.3", "description": "The 3.3.0 is a minor (feature) release with lots of performance and DX improvements, bug fixes and new features to play with.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 11, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 00:59:09", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"favicon": "https://nuxt.com/icon.png", "og:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3-3.png", "og:description": "The 3.3.0 is a minor (feature) release with lots of performance and DX improvements, bug fixes and new features to play with.", "ogImage": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3-3.png", "twitter:image:width": "1200", "og:type": "website", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:image:width": "1200", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og:image:type": "image/png", "theme-color": "#020420", "twitter:image:src": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3-3.png", "og:image:height": "600", "og:site_name": "Nuxt", "description": "The 3.3.0 is a minor (feature) release with lots of performance and DX improvements, bug fixes and new features to play with.", "og:title": "Nuxt 3.3 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "ogSiteName": "Nuxt", "ogTitle": "Nuxt 3.3 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "language": "en", "twitter:site": "nuxt_js", "twitter:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3-3.png", "ogDescription": "The 3.3.0 is a minor (feature) release with lots of performance and DX improvements, bug fixes and new features to play with.", "title": "Nuxt 3.3 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "twitter:image:height": "600", "scrapeId": "28e795ca-10a6-4486-8780-347d1a022462", "sourceURL": "https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-3", "url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-3", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful nuxt-blog expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Nuxt 3.15 Release Notes is in nuxt-blog?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Nuxt 3.15 Release Notes in nuxt-blog.\n\n# Nuxt 3.15 Release Notes\n\nNuxt 3.15 is out - with Vite 6, better HMR and faster performanceHere's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## ‚ùÑÔ∏è Snowfall!\n\nHappy holidays! You'll notice when you start Nuxt that (if you're in the Northern Hemisphere) there's some snow on the loading screen ( #29871).\n\n## ‚ö°Ô∏è Vite 6 included\n\nNuxt v3.15 includes Vite 6 for the first time. Although this is a major version, we expect that this won't be a breaking change for Nuxt users (see full migration guide). However, please take care if you have dependencies that rely on a particular Vite version.\n\nOne of the most significant changes with Vite 6 is the new Environment API, which we hope to use in conjunction with Nitro to improve the server dev environment. Watch this space!\n\nYou can read the full list of changes in the Vite 6 changelog.\n\n## ü™µ Chromium devtools improvements\n\nWe talk a lot about the Nuxt DevTools, but v3.15 ships with better integration in dev mode for Chromium-based browser devtools.\n\nWe now use the Chrome DevTools extensibility API to add support for printing nuxt hook timings in the browser devtools performance panel.\n\n## üó∫Ô∏è Navigation mode for `callOnce`\n\n`callOnce` is a built-in Nuxt composable for running code only once. For example, if the code runs on the server it won't run again on the client. But sometimes you do want code to run on every navigation - just avoid the initial server/client double load. For this, there's a new `mode: 'navigation'` option that will run the code only once per navigation.\n\n## ü•µ HMR for templates, pages + page metadata\n\nWe now implement hot module reloading for Nuxt's virtual files (like routes, plugins, generated files) as well as for the content of page metadata (within a `definePageMeta` macro). This should mean you have a faster experience in development, as well as not needing to reload the page when making changes to your routes.\n\n## üìã Page meta enhancements\n\nWe now support extracting extra page meta keys (likely used by module authors) via `experimental.extraPageMetaExtractionKeys`. This enables module authors to use this information at build time, in the `pages:resolved` hook.\n\nWe also now support local functions in `definePageMeta`. This means you can do something like this:\n\nfunction validateIdParam(route) {\n  return !!(route.params.id && !isNaN(Number(route.params.id)))\n}\n\ndefinePageMeta({\n  validate: validateIdParam,\n})\n\n## üî• Performance improvements\n\nWe now preload the app manifest in the browser if it will be used when hydrating the app.\n\nWe'll also tree shake vue-router's hash mode history out of your bundle if we can - specifically, if you haven't customised your `app/router.options.ts`.\n\n## üê£ v4 updates\n\nIf A few more changes shipped for the new defaults for v4, including only inlining styles by default for Vue components.\n\n## ‚úÖ Upgrading\n\nAs usual, our recommendation for upgrading is to run:\n\nnpx nuxi@latest upgrade --force\n\nThis will refresh your lockfile as well, and ensures that you pull in updates from other dependencies that Nuxt relies on, particularly in the unjs ecosystem.\n\n## Full release notes\n\nRead the full release notes of Nuxt v3.15.0.\n\nA huge thank you to everyone who's been a part of this release. ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nDon't hesitate to let us know if you have any feedback or issues!\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-15", "title": "Nuxt 3.15 Release Notes", "description": "Nuxt 3.15 is out - with Vite 6, better HMR and faster performance", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 10, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 00:59:29", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:image:height": "600", "og:image:type": "image/png", "twitter:site": "nuxt_js", "og:title": "Nuxt 3.15 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "twitter:image:width": "1200", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ogImage": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3.15.png", "twitter:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3.15.png", "og:description": "Nuxt 3.15 is out - with Vite 6, better HMR and faster performance", "og:type": "website", "title": "Nuxt 3.15 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "twitter:image:src": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3.15.png", "theme-color": "#020420", "og:site_name": "Nuxt", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:image:width": "1200", "description": "Nuxt 3.15 is out - with Vite 6, better HMR and faster performance", "language": "en", "favicon": "https://nuxt.com/icon.png", "ogDescription": "Nuxt 3.15 is out - with Vite 6, better HMR and faster performance", "ogTitle": "Nuxt 3.15 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "ogSiteName": "Nuxt", "og:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3.15.png", "twitter:image:height": "600", "scrapeId": "0ade0f6a-a7c0-4ca7-ab03-2d0ab3396f4c", "sourceURL": "https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-15", "url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-15", "statusCode": 200}}}

Here are some tips to keep in mind:\n\nTake care if you have dependencies that rely on a particular Vite version when upgrading to Vite 6.\n\nUse the new `mode: 'navigation'` option with `callOnce` to run code only once per navigation.\n\nRefresh your lockfile when upgrading to ensure you pull in updates from other dependencies.\n\nStick to these, and you'll avoid a lot of headaches!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-15", "title": "Nuxt 3.15 Release Notes", "description": "Nuxt 3.15 is out - with Vite 6, better HMR and faster performance", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 10, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 00:59:29", "type": "best_practices", "page_metadata": {"og:image:height": "600", "og:image:type": "image/png", "twitter:site": "nuxt_js", "og:title": "Nuxt 3.15 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "twitter:image:width": "1200", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ogImage": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3.15.png", "twitter:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3.15.png", "og:description": "Nuxt 3.15 is out - with Vite 6, better HMR and faster performance", "og:type": "website", "title": "Nuxt 3.15 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "twitter:image:src": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3.15.png", "theme-color": "#020420", "og:site_name": "Nuxt", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:image:width": "1200", "description": "Nuxt 3.15 is out - with Vite 6, better HMR and faster performance", "language": "en", "favicon": "https://nuxt.com/icon.png", "ogDescription": "Nuxt 3.15 is out - with Vite 6, better HMR and faster performance", "ogTitle": "Nuxt 3.15 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "ogSiteName": "Nuxt", "og:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3.15.png", "twitter:image:height": "600", "scrapeId": "0ade0f6a-a7c0-4ca7-ab03-2d0ab3396f4c", "sourceURL": "https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-15", "url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-15", "statusCode": 200}}}
{"text": "System: You are a helpful nuxt-blog expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Nuxt 3.10 is in nuxt-blog?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Nuxt 3.10 in nuxt-blog.\n\n# Nuxt 3.10\n\nNuxt 3.10 is out - packed with features and fixes. Here are a few highlights.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## ‚ú® Experimental shared `asyncData` when prerendering\n\nWhen prerendering routes, we can end up refetching the same data over and over again. In Nuxt 2 it was possible to create a 'payload' which could be fetched once and then accessed in every page (and this is of course possible to do manually in Nuxt 3 - see [this article](https://roe.dev/blog/shared-data-nuxt-generate)).\n\nWith [#24894](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/24894), we are now able to do this automatically for you when prerendering your site. Your [`useAsyncData`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-async-data) and [`useFetch`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-fetch) calls will be deduplicated and cached between renders of your site.\n\n## üÜî SSR-safe accessible unique ID creation\n\nWe now ship a `useId` composable for generating SSR-safe unique IDs ( [#23368](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/23368)). This allows creating more accessible interfaces in your app.\n\n## ‚úçÔ∏è Extending `app/router.options`\n\nIt's now possible for module authors to inject their own `router.options` files ( [#24922](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/24922)). The new `pages:routerOptions` hook allows module authors to do things like add custom `scrollBehavior` or add runtime augmenting of routes.\n\n## Client-side Node.js support\n\nWe now support (experimentally) polyfilling key Node.js built-ins ( [#25028](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/25028)), just as we already do via Nitro on the server when deploying to non-Node environments.\n\n## üç™ Better cookie reactivity\n\nWe now allow you to opt-in to using the [CookieStore](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CookieStore). If browser support is present, this will then be used instead of a BroadcastChannel to update `useCookie` values reactively when the cookies are updated ( [#25198](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/25198)).\n\n## üè• Detecting anti-patterns\n\nIn this release, we've also shipped a range of features to detect potential bugs and performance problems.\n\n## üßÇ Granular view transitions support\n\nIt's now possible to control view transitions support on a per-page basis, using `definePageMeta` ( [#25264](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/25264)).\n\n## üèóÔ∏è Build-time route metadata\n\nIt's now possible to access routing metadata defined in `definePageMeta` at build-time, allowing modules and hooks to modify and change these values ( [#25210](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/25210)).\n\n## üì¶ Bundler module resolution\n\nWith [#24837](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/24837), we are now opting in to the TypeScript `bundler` resolution which should more closely resemble the actual way that we resolve subpath imports for modules in Nuxt projects.\n\n## ‚úÖ Upgrading\n\nAs usual, our recommendation for upgrading is to run:\n\n```\nnpx nuxi upgrade --force\n```\n\nThis will refresh your lockfile as well, and ensures that you pull in updates from other dependencies that Nuxt relies on, particularly in the unjs ecosystem.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-10", "title": "Nuxt 3.10", "description": "Nuxt 3.10 is out - packed with features and fixes.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful nuxt-blog expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Nuxt 3.7 is in nuxt-blog?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Nuxt 3.7 in nuxt-blog.\n\n# Nuxt 3.7\n\nNuxt 3.7 is out, bringing a new CLI, native web streams and response, rendering optimisations, async context support - and much more.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## üê£ A New CLI\n\nWe've refactored `nuxi` using [unjs/citty](http://github.com/unjs/citty) and this marks the first Nuxt release that depends on the new version, safely in its own repository. We have grand plans for this - check out some of the features + roadmap discussions in [nuxt/cli](https://github.com/nuxt/cli) and please feel free to contribute!\n\n- [**Project Goals**](https://github.com/nuxt/cli/discussions/3)\n- [Feedbacks and Ideas](https://github.com/nuxt/cli/discussions/4)\n- [The journey of Nuxt CLI Generations](https://github.com/nuxt/cli/discussions/7)\n\nNuxi is now decoupled from the main `nuxt` version - we plan to iterate and release nuxi more quickly in future so you can expect new things coming soon!\n\n## üï∏Ô∏è Native Web Streams and `Response`\n\nWith improvements in [unjs/h3](https://github.com/unjs/h3) and [unjs/nitro](https://github.com/unjs/nitro), it's now possible to directly return a `Response` object from server routes, meaning it's _also_ possible to return and handle streams natively in Nuxt.\n\nüëâ Check out the full detail in the [unjs/h3](https://github.com/unjs/h3/releases) and [unjs/nitro](https://github.com/unjs/nitro/releases) release notes.\n\n## üî• HTML Rendering Optimisations\n\nThis release comes with a couple of improvements in rendering HTML responses from the server. We now determine whether to preload/prefetch resources at build time (so you can customise this in the `build:manifest` hook). We also now manage rendering the HTML for them directly in `unhead` ( [#22179](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/22179)), which means you can configure the _order_ for `<link>`, `<meta>`, `<script>`, `<style>`, and more. And - in our preliminary testing - it's even faster!\n\nIt's possible to opt-in to upcoming head improvements with the `experimental.headNext` flag. This currently includes a new ordering algorithm based on [capo.js](https://github.com/rviscomi/capo.js) ( [#22431](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/22431)) and allows enabling future optimisations as they are released in `unhead`:\n\n```\nexport default defineNuxtConfig({\n  experimental: {\n    headNext: true\n  }\n})\n```\n\nWe'd love your thoughts - you can respond with any issues/feedback in [this discussion](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/discussions/22632).\n\n## üõ†Ô∏è Build Environment Shortcuts\n\nIn your Nuxt config you can now use `$client` and `$server` shortcuts to easily define configuration that is specific to just the Vite client/server ( [#22302](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/22302)) or webpack client/server ( [#22304](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/22304)) builds. This previously was only possible with the `vite:extendConfig` and `webpack:config` hooks.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nexport default defineNuxtConfig({\n  vite: {\n    $client: {\n      build: {\n        rollupOptions: {\n          output: {\n            chunkFileNames: '_nuxt/[hash].js',\n            assetFileNames: '_nuxt/[hash][extname]',\n            entryFileNames: '_nuxt/[hash].js'\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\n\n## ‚ö°Ô∏è Vite 4.4\n\nWe've chosen to unpin Vite from minor versions, meaning whenever Vite releases a new feature version you can opt-in straight away. Vite 4.4 brings a lot of exciting things, including experimental Lightning CSS support - and much more!\n\nüëâ Check out the [Vite release notes](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/main/packages/vite/CHANGELOG.md#440-2023-07-06) for more.\n\n## üí™ TypeScript Updates\n\nWe now use purely relative paths in the generated `tsconfig.json` instead of setting a `baseUrl`. This means better support for dev environments like docker images where the absolute path may not match your IDE ( [#22410](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/22410)).\n\nWe also set a couple of additional compiler flag defaults to match Vite/TS recommendations ( [#22468](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/22468)).\n\nPlus, you should now get type hinted access to layouts in `setPageLayout` and also in `<NuxtLayout name>` ( [#22363](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/22362)).\n\n## ü¶Ñ Async Context support\n\nIf you've ever got an issue with 'Nuxt context unavailable' this might be one for you. We now support native async context for Bun and Node under an experimental flag, in both Nuxt and Nitro ( [#20918](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/20918)).\n\nThis enables using Nuxt composables on the server _without_ needing to ensure they are being called directly in a setup function.

We now determine whether to preload/prefetch resources at build time (so you can customise this in the `build:manifest` hook). We also now manage rendering the HTML for them directly in `unhead` ( [#22179](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/22179)), which means you can configure the _order_ for `<link>`, `<meta>`, `<script>`, `<style>`, and more. And - in our preliminary testing - it's even faster!\n\nIt's possible to opt-in to upcoming head improvements with the `experimental.headNext` flag.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful nuxt-blog expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Nuxt 3.6 Release Notes is in nuxt-blog?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Nuxt 3.6 Release Notes in nuxt-blog.\n\n# Nuxt 3.6 Release Notes\n\nNuxt 3.6 is out, bringing performance improvements, fully static server components, better style inlining, static presets, increased type safety - and much more.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## SPA loading indicator\n\nIf your site is served with `ssr: false` or you have disabled server-rendering on some of your pages, you might be particularly interested in the new built-in SPA loading indicator. You can now place an HTML file in `~/app/spa-loading-template.html` with some HTML you would like to use to render a loading screen that will be rendered until your app is hydrated on these pages. By default an animated Nuxt icon is rendered. You can completely disable this indicator by setting `spaLoadingTemplate: false` in your nuxt configuration file.\n\n## Performance improvements\n\nThe first thing that happens when your app is hydrated is that your plugins run, and so we now perform build-time optimisations on your plugins, meaning they do not need to be normalised or reordered at runtime. We also include your error component JS in your main entrypoint, meaning that if an error occurs when a user has no connectivity, you can still handle it with your `~/error.vue`. This also should decrease your total bundle size. Compared to Nuxt 3.5.3, the minimal client bundle has decreased by ~0.7kB.\n\n## Fully static server components\n\nIt has been possible to use server components on static pages, but until now they would increase the payload size of your application. That is no longer true. We now store rendered server components as separate files, which are preloaded before navigation. This does rely on the new, richer JSON payload format, so make sure you have not disabled this by setting `experimental.renderJsonPayloads` to false.\n\n## Better style inlining\n\nIf you're monitoring your metrics closely and have not turned off `experimental.inlineSSRStyles`, you should see more CSS inlined in your page, and a significantly external CSS file. We're now better at deduplicating global CSS, particularly added by libraries like tailwind or unocss.\n\n## Animation controls\n\nTo give you more fine-grained control over your page/layout components, for example to create custom transitions with GSAP or other libraries, we now allow you to set `pageRef` on `<NuxtPage>` and `layoutRef` on `<NuxtLayout>`. These will get passed through to the underlying DOM elements.\n\n## Automatic 'static' preset detection\n\nUp to now, running `nuxt generate` produced the same output on every deployment provider, but with Nuxt 3.6 we now enable static provider presets automatically. That means if you are deploying a static build (produced with `nuxt generate`) to a supported provider (currently vercel and netlify with cloudflare and github pages coming soon) we'll prerender your pages with special support for that provider.\n\n## Increased type safety\n\nWe now have better support for server-specific `#imports` and augmentations if you are using the new `~/server/tsconfig.json` we shipped in Nuxt 3.5. So when importing from `#imports` in your server directory, you'll get IDE auto-completion for the right import locations in Nitro, and won't see Vue auto-imports like `useFetch` that are unavailable within your server routes.\n\n## Nitro 2.5 built-in\n\nThis release ships with new Nitro 2.5, which has a whole list of exciting improvements that are worth checking out. Of particular note is experimental support for streaming, which is also enabled by a couple of changes in Nuxt itself.\n\n## New tools for module authors\n\nThis release brings a number of utilities for modules authors to easily add type templates and assert compatibility with a given version of another module. In addition, this release will finally unlock a new `nuxt/module-builder` mode that should improve type support for module authors.\n\n## Upgrading\n\nAs usual, our recommendation for upgrading is to run:\n\n```\nnpx nuxi upgrade --force\n```\n\nThis will refresh your lockfile as well, and ensures that you pull in updates from other dependencies that Nuxt relies on, particularly in the unjs ecosystem.\n\n## Full changelog\n\nRead the full release notes on https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/releases/tag/v3.6.0\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-6", "title": "Nuxt 3.6 Release Notes", "description": "Nuxt 3.6 is out, bringing performance improvements, fully static server components, better style inlining, static presets, increased type safety - and much more.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 11, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 01:01:44", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"twitter:image:width": "1200", "favicon": "https://nuxt.com/icon.png", "ogTitle": "Nuxt 3.6 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "og:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3-6.png", "twitter:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3-6.png", "twitter:image:height": "600", "title": "Nuxt 3.6 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "ogDescription": "Nuxt 3.6 is out, bringing performance improvements, fully static server components, better style inlining, static presets, increased type safety - and much more.", "ogImage": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3-6.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "language": "en", "og:type": "website", "theme-color": "#020420", "description": "Nuxt 3.6 is out, bringing performance improvements, fully static server components, better style inlining, static presets, increased type safety - and much more.", "og:description": "Nuxt 3.6 is out, bringing performance improvements, fully static server components, better style inlining, static presets, increased type safety - and much more.", "og:title": "Nuxt 3.6 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "og:image:type": "image/png", "twitter:site": "nuxt_js", "og:site_name": "Nuxt", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:image:height": "600", "ogSiteName": "Nuxt", "twitter:image:src": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3-6.png", "og:image:width": "1200", "scrapeId": "11985039-8299-4999-a9b2-e3a7ac63cbde", "sourceURL": "https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-6", "url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-6", "statusCode": 200}}}

We also include your error component JS in your main entrypoint, meaning that if an error occurs when a user has no connectivity, you can still handle it with your `~/error.vue`. This also should decrease your total bundle size.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful nuxt-blog expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Refreshed Nuxt ESLint Integrations is in nuxt-blog?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Refreshed Nuxt ESLint Integrations in nuxt-blog.\n\n# Refreshed Nuxt ESLint Integrations\n\nWe revamped our ESLint integrations to support ESLint v9 with the flat config, as well as a new module with many more capabilities.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## TL;DR\n\nWe revamped our ESLint integrations to support ESLint v9 with the new flat config. Along the way, we have explored many new possibilities to make it more personalized, powerful, and with better developer experience.\n\nYou can run the following command to install the new [`@nuxt/eslint`](https://eslint.nuxt.com/packages/module) module:\n\nTerminal\n\n```\nnpx nuxi module add eslint\n```\n\nContinue reading the story or learn more with [the documentation](https://eslint.nuxt.com/packages/module).\n\n## Background\n\n[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) has become an essential tool for today's web development. It helps you to catch errors and enforce a consistent coding style in your project. At Nuxt, we do our best to provide an out-of-the-box experience for ESLint, making it easy to use, configure and follow the best practices we recommend.\n\nSince, both Nuxt and ESLint have evolved a lot. Historically, we ended up with [a few different packages and integrations for ESLint in Nuxt](https://eslint.nuxt.com/guide/faq#package-disambiguation), and it wasn't always obvious which one to use for what purpose. We have received a lot of feedback from our community.\n\nTo improve the situation and also make it future-proof, we recently refreshed our ESLint integrations to support [ESLint v9](https://eslint.org/blog/2024/04/eslint-v9.0.0-released/) with the [flat config](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files). It opens up many more capabilities for customizing your ESLint setup, providing a more straightforward and unified experience.\n\n## Nuxt ESLint Monorepo\n\nWe moved ESLint-related packages scattered across different repositories into a single monorepo: [`nuxt/eslint`](https://github.com/nuxt/eslint), with a dedicated new documentation site: [eslint.nuxt.com](https://eslint.nuxt.com/).\n\nTo help understand the differences between each package and what to use, we also have a [FAQ](https://eslint.nuxt.com/guide/faq) page comparing them and explaining their scopes.\n\nThis monorepo now includes:\n\n- `@nuxt/eslint` \\- The new, all-in-one ESLint module for Nuxt 3, supporting project-aware ESLint flat config and more.\n- `@nuxt/eslint-config` \\- The unopinionated but customizable shared ESLint config for Nuxt 3. Supports both [the flat config format](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files) and [the legacy format](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files-deprecated).\n- `@nuxt/eslint-plugin` \\- The ESLint plugin for Nuxt 3 provides Nuxt-specific rules and configurations.\n- Two packages for Nuxt 2 in maintenance mode.\n\n## ESLint Flat Config\n\nBefore diving into new Nuxt integrations, let me introduce you to the concept of [ESLint flat config](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files).\n\nFlat config is a configuration format introduced in ESLint `v8.21.0` as experimental, and became the default format in [ESLint v9](https://eslint.org/blog/2024/04/eslint-v9.0.0-released/).\n\nA quick reference to differentiate:\n\n- **Flat config**: `eslint.config.js` `eslint.config.mjs` etc.\n- **Legacy config**: `.eslintrc` `.eslintrc.json` `.eslintrc.js` etc.\n\n## Why Flat Config?\n\n[This blog post from ESLint](https://eslint.org/blog/2022/08/new-config-system-part-1/) explains the motivation behind the flat config system in detail. In short, the legacy `eslintrc` format was designed in the early time of JavaScript, when ES modules and modern JavaScript features were not yet standardized. Many implicit conventions involved, and the `extends` feature makes the final config result hard to understand and predict. Which also makes shared configs hard to maintain and debug.\n\n## Nuxt Presets for Flat Config\n\nIn the latest [`@nuxt/eslint-config` package](https://eslint.nuxt.com/packages/config#flat-config-format), we leverage the flexibility we have to provide a factory function that allows you to customize the config presets easily in a more high-level way. Here is an example of how you can use it:\n\neslint.config.js\n\n```\nimport { createConfigForNuxt } from '@nuxt/eslint-config/flat'\n\nexport default createConfigForNuxt()\n```\n\n`@nuxt/eslint-config` starts with an unopinionated base config, which means we only include rules for best practices of TypeScript, Vue and Nuxt, and leave the rest like code style, formatting, etc for you to decide. You can also run [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) alongside for formatting with the defaults.\n\n## Nuxt ESLint Module\n\nTaking this even further, we made the new, all-in-one [`@nuxt/eslint` module](https://eslint.nuxt.com/packages/module) for Nuxt 3. It leverages Nuxt's context to generate project-aware and type-safe ESLint configurations for your project.\n\n## Project-aware Rules\n\nWe know that Vue's Style Guide suggests the use of [multi-word names for components](https://vuejs.org/style-guide/rules-essential.html#use-multi-word-component-names) to avoid conflicts with existing and future HTML elements. Thus, in [`eslint-plugin-vue`](https://github.com/vuejs/eslint-plugin-vue), we have the rule [`vue/multi-word-component-names`](https://eslint.vuejs.org/rules/multi-word-component-names.html) enabled by default. It's a good practice to follow, but we know that in a Nuxt project, not all `.vue` files are registered as components. Files like `app.vue`, `pages/index.vue`, `layouts/default.vue`, etc. are not available as components in other Vue files, and the rule will be irrelevant to them.\n\n## Config Inspector DevTools Integrations\n\nDuring the migrations and research for the new flat config, I came up with the idea to make an interactive UI inspector for the flat config and make the configurations more transparent and easier to understand. We have integrated it into [Nuxt DevTools](https://github.com/nuxt/devtools) when you have the `@nuxt/eslint` module installed so you easily access it whenever you need it.\n\n## Type Generation for Rules\n\nOne of the main pain points of configuring ESLint was the leak of type information for the rules and configurations. It's hard to know what options are available for a specific rule, and it would require you to jump around the documentation for every rule to figure that out.\n\n## Dev Server Checker\n\nWith the new module, we took the chance to merge the [`@nuxtjs/eslint-module`](https://github.com/nuxt-modules/eslint) and the dev server checker for ESLint into the new `@nuxt/eslint` module as an opt-in feature.\n\n## Module Hooks\n\nSince we are now in the Nuxt module with the codegen capabilities and the project-aware configurations, we can actually do a lot more interesting things with this.\n\n## Ecosystem\n\nAt Nuxt, we care a lot about the ecosystem and the community as always. During our explorations to adopt the new flat config and improve the developer experience, we made quite a few tools to reach that goal.\n\n## The Future\n\nThe flat config format is still fairly new, and ESLint v9 was just released a couple of weeks ago. Plugins and the community are gradually catching up to the new format. It's still in the phase of exploration and experimentation.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/eslint-module", "title": "Refreshed Nuxt ESLint Integrations", "description": "We revamped our ESLint integrations to support ESLint v9 with the flat config, as well as a new module with many more capabilities.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 14, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 01:04:35", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"title": "Refreshed Nuxt ESLint Integrations ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "twitter:image:height": "600", "ogImage": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/nuxt-eslint-refreshed.png", "og:image:width": "1200", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "language": "en", "theme-color": "#020420", "ogSiteName": "Nuxt", "og:image:height": "600", "og:site_name": "Nuxt", "ogDescription": "We revamped our ESLint integrations to support ESLint v9 with the flat config, as well as a new module with many more capabilities.", "favicon": "https://nuxt.com/icon.png", "description": "We revamped our ESLint integrations to support ESLint v9 with the flat config, as well as a new module with many more capabilities.", "twitter:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/nuxt-eslint-refreshed.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "twitter:image:width": "1200", "ogTitle": "Refreshed Nuxt ESLint Integrations ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "og:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/nuxt-eslint-refreshed.png", "og:type": "website", "og:description": "We revamped our ESLint integrations to support ESLint v9 with the flat config, as well as a new module with many more capabilities.", "og:title": "Refreshed Nuxt ESLint Integrations ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "twitter:image:src": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/nuxt-eslint-refreshed.png", "twitter:site": "nuxt_js", "og:image:type": "image/png", "scrapeId": "38e07c3c-42f6-4b85-831d-f95e303578e9", "sourceURL": "https://nuxt.com/blog/eslint-module", "url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/eslint-module", "statusCode": 200}}}

It opens up many more capabilities for customizing your ESLint setup, providing a more straightforward and unified experience..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/eslint-module", "title": "Refreshed Nuxt ESLint Integrations", "description": "We revamped our ESLint integrations to support ESLint v9 with the flat config, as well as a new module with many more capabilities.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 14, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 01:04:35", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"title": "Refreshed Nuxt ESLint Integrations ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "twitter:image:height": "600", "ogImage": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/nuxt-eslint-refreshed.png", "og:image:width": "1200", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "language": "en", "theme-color": "#020420", "ogSiteName": "Nuxt", "og:image:height": "600", "og:site_name": "Nuxt", "ogDescription": "We revamped our ESLint integrations to support ESLint v9 with the flat config, as well as a new module with many more capabilities.", "favicon": "https://nuxt.com/icon.png", "description": "We revamped our ESLint integrations to support ESLint v9 with the flat config, as well as a new module with many more capabilities.", "twitter:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/nuxt-eslint-refreshed.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "twitter:image:width": "1200", "ogTitle": "Refreshed Nuxt ESLint Integrations ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "og:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/nuxt-eslint-refreshed.png", "og:type": "website", "og:description": "We revamped our ESLint integrations to support ESLint v9 with the flat config, as well as a new module with many more capabilities.", "og:title": "Refreshed Nuxt ESLint Integrations ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "twitter:image:src": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/nuxt-eslint-refreshed.png", "twitter:site": "nuxt_js", "og:image:type": "image/png", "scrapeId": "38e07c3c-42f6-4b85-831d-f95e303578e9", "sourceURL": "https://nuxt.com/blog/eslint-module", "url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/eslint-module", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful nuxt-blog expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Nuxt 3.13 is in nuxt-blog?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Nuxt 3.13 in nuxt-blog.\n\n# Nuxt 3.13\n\nNuxt 3.13 is out - porting back some of the new features we're building for Nuxt 4!Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## üèòÔ∏è Route Groups\n\nWe now support naming directories with parentheses/brackets to organise your routes without affecting the path.\n\nFor example:\n\nDirectory structure\n\n```\n-| pages/\n---| index.vue\n---| (marketing)/\n-----| about.vue\n-----| contact.vue\n```\n\nThis will produce `/`, `/about` and `/contact` pages in your app. The `marketing` group is ignored for purposes of your URL structure.\n\nRead more in [the original PR](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/28276).\n\n## üèùÔ∏è Islands and Head Metadata\n\nIt's now possible for server component islands to manipulate the head, such as by adding SEO metadata when rendering.\n\nRead more in [#27987](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/27987).\n\n## ü™ù Custom Prefetch Triggers\n\nWe now support custom prefetch triggers for `NuxtLink` ( [#27846](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/27846)).\n\nFor example:\n\npages/index.vue\n\n```\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <NuxtLink prefetch-on=\"interaction\">\n      This will prefetch when hovered or when it gains focus\n    </NuxtLink>\n    <!-- note that you probably don't want both enabled! -->\n    <NuxtLink :prefetch-on=\"{ visibility: true, interaction: true }\">\n      This will prefetch when hovered/focus - or when it becomes visible\n    </NuxtLink>\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\nIt's also possible to enable/disable these globally for your app and override them per link.\n\nFor example:\n\nnuxt.config.ts\n\n```\nexport default defineNuxtConfig({\n  experimental: {\n    defaults: {\n      nuxtLink: {\n        prefetch: true,\n        prefetchOn: { visibility: false, interaction: true }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n})\n``\n\n## üó∫Ô∏è Better Server Source Maps\n\nWhen running with `node --enable-source-maps`, you may have noticed that the source maps for the Vue files in your server build pointed to the Vite build output (something like `.nuxt/dist/server/_nuxt/index-O15BBwZ3.js`).\n\nNow, even after your Nitro build, your server source maps will reference your original source files ( [#28521](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/28521)).\n\nNote that one of the easiest ways of improving your build performance is to turn off source maps if you aren't using them, which you can do easily in your `nuxt.config`:\n\nnuxt.config.ts\n\n```\nexport default defineNuxtConfig({\n  sourcemap: {\n    server: false,\n    client: true,\n  },\n})\n``\n\n## üéÅ New Features for Module Authors\n\nIn the run-up to Nuxt v4, we're working on adding some key functionality for module authors, including a new `isNuxtMajorVersion` utility where required ( [#27579](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/27579)) and better inferred typing for merged module options using the new `defineNuxtModule().with()` method ( [#27520](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/27520)).\n\n## ‚ú® Improved Dev Warnings\n\nWe no longer warn when using data fetching composables in middleware ( [#28604](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/28604)) and we warn when user components' names begin with Lazy ( [#27838](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/27838)).\n\n## üö® Vue TypeScript Changes\n\nFor a while, in the Vue ecosystem, we've been augmenting `@vue/runtime-core` to add custom properties and more to `vue`. However, this inadvertently breaks the types for projects that augment `vue` - which is now the officially recommended and documented way to augment these interfaces (for example, [ComponentCustomProperties](https://vuejs.org/api/utility-types.html#componentcustomproperties), [GlobalComponents](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/web-components.html#web-components-and-typescript) and [so on](https://vuejs.org/guide/typescript/options-api.html#augmenting-global-properties)).\n\nThis means _all_ libraries must update their code (or it will break the types of libraries that augment `vue` instead).\n\nWe've updated our types in Nuxt along these lines but you may experience issues with the latest `vue-router` when used with libraries which haven't yet done so.\n\nPlease create an issue with a reproduction - I'll happily help create a PR to resolve in the upstream library in question. Or you may be able to work around the issue by creating a `declarations.d.ts` in the root of your project with the following code ( [credit](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/28542#issuecomment-2293282891) to [@BobbieGoede](https://github.com/BobbieGoede)):\n\ndeclarations.d.ts\n\n```\nimport type {\n  ComponentCustomOptions as _ComponentCustomOptions,\n  ComponentCustomProperties as _ComponentCustomProperties,\n} from 'vue';\n\ndeclare module '@vue/runtime-core' {\n  interface ComponentCustomProperties extends _ComponentCustomProperties {}\n  interface ComponentCustomOptions extends _ComponentCustomOptions {}\n}\n``\n\n## ‚úÖ Upgrading\n\nAs usual, our recommendation for upgrading is to run:\n\n```\nnpx nuxi@latest upgrade --force\n```\n\nThis will refresh your lockfile as well, and ensures that you pull in updates from other dependencies that Nuxt relies on, particularly in the unjs ecosystem.\n\n## Full Release Notes\n\nRead the full release notes of Nuxt `v3.13.0`.\n\nA huge thank you to everyone who's been a part of this release - you are the ones who make Nuxt possible. ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nDon't hesitate to let us know if you have any feedback or issues! üôè\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-13", "title": "Nuxt 3.13", "description": "Nuxt 3.13 is out - porting back some of the new features we're building for Nuxt 4!", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 9, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 01:05:14", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"description": "Nuxt 3.13 is out - porting back some of the new features we're building for Nuxt 4!", "ogDescription": "Nuxt 3.13 is out - porting back some of the new features we're building for Nuxt 4!", "twitter:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3.13.png", "favicon": "https://nuxt.com/icon.png", "ogTitle": "Nuxt 3.13 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3.13.png", "og:site_name": "Nuxt", "og:type": "website", "og:title": "Nuxt 3.13 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "twitter:image:src": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3.13.png", "twitter:site": "nuxt_js", "og:description": "Nuxt 3.13 is out - porting back some of the new features we're building for Nuxt 4!", "ogImage": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3.13.png", "og:image:height": "600", "og:image:type": "image/png", "twitter:image:width": "1200", "og:image:width": "1200", "title": "Nuxt 3.13 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "language": "en", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "twitter:image:height": "600", "theme-color": "#020420", "ogSiteName": "Nuxt", "scrapeId": "59b42637-1d02-48ba-864d-30dfee426eee", "sourceURL": "https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-13", "url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-13", "statusCode": 200}}}

Or you may be able to work around the issue by creating a `declarations.d.ts` in the root of your project with the following code ( [credit](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/28542#issuecomment-2293282891) to [@BobbieGoede](https://github.com/BobbieGoede)):\n\ndeclarations.d.ts\n\n```\nimport type {\n  ComponentCustomOptions as _ComponentCustomOptions,\n  ComponentCustomProperties as _ComponentCustomProperties,\n} from 'vue';\n\ndeclare module '@vue/runtime-core' {\n  interface ComponentCustomProperties extends _ComponentCustomProperties {}\n  interface ComponentCustomOptions extends _ComponentCustomOptions {}\n}\n``.\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-13", "title": "Nuxt 3.13", "description": "Nuxt 3.13 is out - porting back some of the new features we're building for Nuxt 4!", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 9, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 01:05:14", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"description": "Nuxt 3.13 is out - porting back some of the new features we're building for Nuxt 4!", "ogDescription": "Nuxt 3.13 is out - porting back some of the new features we're building for Nuxt 4!", "twitter:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3.13.png", "favicon": "https://nuxt.com/icon.png", "ogTitle": "Nuxt 3.13 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3.13.png", "og:site_name": "Nuxt", "og:type": "website", "og:title": "Nuxt 3.13 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "twitter:image:src": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3.13.png", "twitter:site": "nuxt_js", "og:description": "Nuxt 3.13 is out - porting back some of the new features we're building for Nuxt 4!", "ogImage": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3.13.png", "og:image:height": "600", "og:image:type": "image/png", "twitter:image:width": "1200", "og:image:width": "1200", "title": "Nuxt 3.13 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "language": "en", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "twitter:image:height": "600", "theme-color": "#020420", "ogSiteName": "Nuxt", "scrapeId": "59b42637-1d02-48ba-864d-30dfee426eee", "sourceURL": "https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-13", "url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-13", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful nuxt-blog expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Nuxt 3.12 is in nuxt-blog?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Nuxt 3.12 in nuxt-blog.\n\n# Nuxt 3.12\n\nNuxt 3.12 is out - full of improvements and preparing the way for Nuxt 4!Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## üöÄ Testing Nuxt 4 changes\n\nNuxt 4 is on the horizon, and it's now possible to test out the behaviour changes that will be coming in the next major release ( #26925) by setting an option in your `nuxt.config` file:\n\n```\nexport default defineNuxtConfig({\n  future: {\n    compatibilityVersion: 4,\n  },\n})\n```\n\nAs we've been merging PRs for Nuxt 4, we've been enabling them behind this flag. As much as possible we're aiming for backwards compatibility - our test matrix is running the same fixtures in both v3 and v4 compatibility mode.\n\nThere is a lot to say here, with 10+ different PRs and behaviour changes documented and testable, but for full details, including migration steps, see [the v4 upgrade documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/upgrade#testing-nuxt-4).\n\nWe'd be very grateful for early testing of what's coming in Nuxt 4! üôè\n\n## üìú Nuxt Scripts auto-install\n\nWe've been gradually working to release [Nuxt Scripts](https://scripts.nuxt.com/). It's currently in public preview, but we're near a public release, so we've added some stubs for composables that (when used) will prompt installing the `@nuxt/scripts` module.\n\nüëâ Watch out for the launch - and an article explaining more!\n\n## üåà Layer auto-registration and bugfixes\n\nJust like `~/modules`, any layers within your project in the `~/layers` directory will now be automatically registered as layers in your project ( #27221).\n\nWe also now correctly load layer dependencies, which should resolve a range of issues with monorepos and git installations ( #27338).\n\n## üåê Built-in accessibility improvements\n\nWe now have a built-in [`<NuxtRouteAnnouncer>`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/components/nuxt-route-announcer) component and corresponding [`useRouteAnnouncer`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-route-announcer) composable, which will be added by default to new Nuxt templates going forward.\n\nFor full details, see [the original PR (#25741)](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/25741) and [documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/components/nuxt-route-announcer).\n\nWe're continuing to work on `nuxt/a11y` - expect to hear more on that in future!\n\n## üî• Performance improvements\n\nWe've landed some performance improvements as well, many of which are behind the `compatibilityVersion: 4` flag, such as a move away from deeply reactive asyncData payloads.\n\nSignificant improvements include deduplicating modules ( #27475) - which will apply mostly to layer users who specify modules in their layers. In one project, we saw 30s+ improvement in starting Nuxt.\n\nWe've also improved Vite dev server start up time by excluding common ESM dependencies from pre-bundling, and would suggest module authors consider doing the same ( #27372).\n\nWe improved chunk determinism, so sequential builds should be less likely to have _completely_ different chunk hashes ( #27258).\n\nAnd we tree shake more client-only composables from your server builds ( #27044), and have reduced the size of server component payloads ( #26863).\n\n## üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ Multi-app support\n\nWe've landed a couple of changes that take us toward a place of supporting multi-app natively in Nuxt, including a `multiApp` experimental flag ( #27291) and the ability to have multiple Nuxt app instances running in parallel at runtime ( #27068).\n\nWhile it's not yet ready, please do follow along on [the tracker issue](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/issues/21635), and feel free to pitch in if this is interesting to you.\n\n## ‚õëÔ∏è DX wins\n\nWe now serialise more things in your dev server logs, including VNodes ( #27309) and [URLs](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/commit/a549b46e9). We also addressed a bug that could lead to a frozen dev server.\n\nWhen accessing private runtime config in the browser, we now let you know with a more informative error message ( #26441).\n\n## ü™® Stabilising features\n\nWe've removed some experimental options that have been stabilised and which we feel no longer need to be configurable:\n\n- `experimental.treeshakeClientOnly` (enabled by default since v3.0.0)\n- `experimental.configSchema` (enabled by default since v3.3.0)\n- `experimental.polyfillVueUseHead` (disabled since v3.4.0) - implementable in user-land with [plugin](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/blob/f209158352b09d1986aa320e29ff36353b91c358/packages/nuxt/src/head/runtime/plugins/vueuse-head-polyfill.ts#L10-L11)\n- `experimental.respectNoSSRHeader` (disabled since v3.4.0) - implementable in user-land with [server middleware](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/blob/c660b39447f0d5b8790c0826092638d321cd6821/packages/nuxt/src/core/runtime/nitro/no-ssr.ts#L8-L9)\n\nWe've also enabled `scanPageMeta` by default ( #27134). This pulls out any page metadata in your `definePageMeta` macro, and makes it available to modules (like `@nuxtjs/i18n`) so they can augment it.\n\nThis unlocks much better module/typed routing integration, but has a potential performance cost - so please file an issue if you experience any problems.\n\n## üí™ Type improvements\n\nWe now have support for typed `#fallback` slots in server components ( #27097).\n\nWe've also improved some defaults in your generated `tsconfig.json`, including setting `module: 'preserve'` if you have a locally installed TypeScript v5.4 version ( [see docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#preserve)) - see [#26667](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/26667), [#27485](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/27485).\n\n## üì¶ Module author/power user improvements\n\nWe have shipped a range of type improvements for module authors, including:\n\n- support for typed module options in `installModule` ( #26744)\n- the option to specify compatibility with certain builders (vite/webpack) in module options ( #27022)\n- a new `onPrehydrate` hook for hooking into the browser hydration cycle ( #27037)\n- the ability to access and update _resolved_ runtime configuration within modules, with new build-time `useRuntimeConfig` and `updateRuntimeConfig` utils ( #27117).\n\n## üé® Inlined UI templates\n\nIf you previously used `@nuxt/ui-templates` then it may be worth knowing that we have moved them from [a separate repository](https://github.com/nuxt/ui-templates) into the [nuxt/nuxt](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt) monorepo. (This is purely a refactor rather than a change, although you can expect some new designs for Nuxt v4.)\n\n## ‚úÖ Upgrading\n\nAs usual, our recommendation for upgrading is to run:\n\n```\nnpx nuxi@latest upgrade --force\n```\n\nThis will refresh your lockfile as well, and ensures that you pull in updates from other dependencies that Nuxt relies on, particularly in the unjs ecosystem.\n\n## Full Release Notes\n\nRead the full release notes of Nuxt `v3.12.0`.\n\nA huge thank you to the 75+ Nuxt contributors and community members who have been part of this release. ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nFinally, thank you for reading this far!

{"text": "System: You are a helpful nuxt-blog expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Nuxt 2 End-of-Life (EOL) is in nuxt-blog?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Nuxt 2 End-of-Life (EOL) in nuxt-blog.\n\n# Nuxt 2 End-of-Life (EOL)\n\nAnnouncement regarding the End-of-Life for Nuxt 2 and options for users moving forward.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## What happens on June 30th, 2024?\n\nAfter this date, Nuxt 2 will continue to be available on the NPM package manager, but will no longer receive updates, such as security and browser compatibility fixes. In other words, your applications will continue to work, but you may get deprecation warnings from your package manager reminding you that Nuxt 2 is no longer a supported version.\n\nVue 2 reached its end-of-life date on December 31st, 2023.\n\n## What‚Äôs Next?\n\nNuxt 3 has been the default version of Nuxt since November 16th, 2022.\n\nOn top of using Vue 3 and the composition API, it is shipped with features and innovations:\n\n- Universal & Hybrid Rendering: Benefits of both SPA and SSR, with fine-grained control over route rendering\n- Support for serverless environments (AWS Lambda, Deno, Cloudflare Workers) with minimal cold-start.\n- First-Class TypeScript Support: Full typing across all components and configurations.\n- Vite integration for a faster developer experience\n- Server & API routes with end-to-end typing powered by Nitro\n- Auto import of composables & utils\n- Layers feature for domain driven development\n\nWhen and if you can, consider migrating to Nuxt 3 to take advantage of these powerful features.\n\n## Still on Nuxt 2? Here Are Your Options.\n\nRecognizing the various situations that arise during transitions, we are fully aware that users may need other options until they can migrate, or maybe migration simply isn't a feasible path. Here are some other options to consider:\n\n### Update to the Nuxt 2 latest release\nWe expect to release 2.18.0 at the end of June 2024, which will include a few final fixes.\n\nWe strongly encourage you to update to 2.18.0 once it's out. This will be the starting point for extended support mentioned below.\n\n### Purchase Extended Support for Nuxt 2\nIf you have to stay on Nuxt 2 post-EOL, we have partnered with HeroDevs to offer Nuxt 2 Never-Ending Support (NES). Nuxt 2 NES provides ongoing security and compatibility patches for Nuxt 2 and all official Nuxt Modules (modules released by the Nuxt team, labeled `@nuxt/...` in the marketplace) even after EOL so that applications with strict compliance requirements remain secure and compliant. It also guarantees that Nuxt 2 applications will continue to operate effectively in modern browsers and maintain compatibility with essential libraries like Vue 2. Moreover, Nuxt 2 NES has continuous security monitoring and an enterprise level SLA with respect to support and fixes.\n\nNuxt 2 NES is the continuation of the flavor of security support you‚Äôve enjoyed during the Nuxt 2 LTS period ‚Äî but indefinitely.\n\n### Notify Your Users of Your Nuxt 2 Post-EOL Plan\nIf migrating to Nuxt 3 or using Nuxt 2 NES isn't feasible right now, but you're still on Nuxt 2, it's essential to plan how you'll communicate your security strategy to your customers.\n\n## Looking Forward\n\nIt is with a heavy heart that I am saying goodbye to Nuxt 2. After many years of working on it and seeing so many websites made with it, this famous loading bar at the top of each Nuxt 2 website will be something I‚Äôll miss a lot! It is with excitement and energy that I will keep working with the core team on the future of Nuxt to keep innovating like we've been doing over these past 8 years.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/nuxt2-eol", "title": "Nuxt 2 End-of-Life (EOL)", "description": "Announcement regarding the End-of-Life for Nuxt 2 and options for users moving forward.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 4, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 01:06:55", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"ogImage": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/nuxt2-eol.png", "og:image:height": "600", "title": "Nuxt 2 End-of-Life (EOL) ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "favicon": "https://nuxt.com/icon.png", "ogSiteName": "Nuxt", "ogTitle": "Nuxt 2 End-of-Life (EOL) ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "twitter:image:src": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/nuxt2-eol.png", "og:image:width": "1200", "theme-color": "#020420", "twitter:image:width": "1200", "og:type": "website", "twitter:site": "nuxt_js", "og:image:type": "image/png", "description": "Nuxt 2 will reach End of Life (EOL) on June 30th, 2024.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful nuxt-blog expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Introducing Nuxt Scripts is in nuxt-blog?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Introducing Nuxt Scripts in nuxt-blog.\n\n# Introducing Nuxt Scripts\n\nNuxt Scripts provides better performance, privacy, security, and developer experience for third-party scripts.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Getting to Nuxt Scripts\n\nOver a year ago, Daniel published the initial Nuxt Scripts RFC. The RFC proposed a module that would \"allow third-party scripts to be managed and optimized, following best practices for performant and compliant websites\".\n\nHaving personal experience with solving performance issues related to third-party scripts, I knew how difficult these performance optimizations could be. Nonetheless, I was keen to tackle the problem and took over the project.\n\nWith the RFC as the seed of the idea, I started prototyping what it could look like using Unhead.\n\nThinking about what I wanted to build exactly, I found that the real issue wasn't just how to load \"optimized\" third-party scripts but how to make working with third-party scripts a better experience overall.\n\n## Why Build a Third-Party Script Module?\n\n94% of sites use at least one third-party provider, with the average site having five third-party providers.\n\nWe know that third-party scripts aren't perfect; they slow down the web, cause privacy and security issues, and are a pain to work with.\n\nHowever, they are fundamentally useful and aren't going anywhere soon.\n\nBy exploring the issues with third-party scripts, we can see where improvements can be made.\n\n## Developer Experience: A Full-Stack Headache\n\nLet's walk through adding a third-party script to your Nuxt app using a fictional tracker.js script that adds a track function to the window.\n\nWe start by loading the script using useHead.\n\n```javascript\nuseHead({ scripts: [{ src: '/tracker.js', defer: true }] })\n```\n\nHowever, let's now try to get the script functionality working in our app.\n\nThe following steps are common when working with third-party scripts in Nuxt:\n\n- Everything has to be wrapped for SSR safety.\n- Flaky checks for if the script has loaded.\n- Augmenting the window object for types.\n\n```javascript\n<script setup>\n// ‚ùå Oops, window is not defined!\n// üí° The window can't be directly accessed if we use SSR in Nuxt.\n// üëâ We need to make this SSR safe\nwindow.track('page_view', useRoute().path)\n</script>\n```\n\n## Performance: \"Why can't I get 100 on Lighthouse?\"\n\nFor a visitor to start interacting with your Nuxt site, the app bundle needs to be downloaded and Vue needs to hydrate the app instance.\n\nLoading third-party scripts can interfere with this hydration process, even when using async or defer. This slows down the network and blocks the main thread, leading to a degraded user experience and poor Core Web Vitals.\n\nThe Chrome User Experience Report shows Nuxt sites with numerous third-party resources typically have poorer Interaction to Next Paint (INP) and Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) scores.\n\nTo see how third-party scripts degrade performance, we can look at the Web Almanac 2022. The report shows that the top 10 third-party scripts average median blocking time is 1.4 seconds.\n\n## Privacy & Security: Do no evil?\n\nOf the top 10,000 sites, 58% of them have third-party scripts that exchange tracking IDs stored in external cookies, meaning they can track users across sites even with third-party cookies disabled.\n\nWhile in many cases our hands are tied with the providers we use, we should try to minimize the amount of our end-users' data that we're leaking where possible.\n\nWhen we do take on the privacy implications, it can then be difficult to accurately convey these in our privacy policies and build the consent management required to comply with regulations such as GDPR.\n\nSecurity when using third-party scripts is also a concern. Third-party scripts are common attack vectors for malicious actors, most do not provide integrity hashes for their scripts, meaning they can be compromised and inject malicious code into your app at any time.\n\n## What does Nuxt Scripts do about these issues?\n\nThis composable sits between the <script> tag and the functionality added to window.{thirdPartyKey}.\n\nFor the <script> tag, the composable:\n\n- Gives full visibility into the script's loading and error states\n- Loads scripts as Nuxt is hydrating the app by default, for slightly better performance.\n- Restricts crossorigin and referrerpolicy to improve privacy and security.\n- Provides a way to delay loading the script until you need it.\n\nFor the scripts API, it:\n\n- Provides full type-safety around the script's functions\n- Adds a proxy layer allowing your app to run when the script functions in unsafe contexts (SSR, before the script is loaded, the script is blocked)\n\n```javascript\nconst { proxy, onLoaded } = useScript('/hello.js', {\n  trigger: 'onNuxtReady',\n  use() {\n    return window.helloWorld\n  }\n})\n\nonLoaded(({ greeting }) => {\n  // ‚úÖ script is loaded! Hooks into Vue lifecycle\n})\n\n// ‚úÖ OR use the proxy API - SSR friendly, called when script is loaded\nproxy.greeting() // Hello, World!\n\ndeclare global {\n  interface Window {\n    helloWorld: {\n      greeting: () => 'Hello World!'\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Script Registry\n\nThe script registry is a collection of first-party integrations for common third-party scripts. As of release, we support 21 scripts, with more to come.\n\nThese registry scripts are fine-tuned wrappers around useScript with full type-safety, runtime validation of the script options (dev only) and environment variable support.\n\nFor example, we can look at the Fathom Analytics script.\n\n```javascript\nconst { proxy } = useScriptFathomAnalytics({\n  // ‚úÖ options are validated at runtime\n  site: undefined\n})\n// ‚úÖ typed\nproxy.trackPageview()\n```\n\n## Facade Components\n\nThe registry includes several facade components, such as Google Maps, YouTube and Intercom.\n\nFacade components are \"fake\" components that get hydrated when the third-party script loads. Facade components have trade-offs but can drastically improve your performance. See the What are Facade Components? guide for more information.\n\nNuxt Scripts provides facade components as accessible but headless, meaning they are not styled by default but add the necessary a16y data.\n\n## Consent Management & Element Event Triggers\n\nThe useScript composable gives you full control over how and when your scripts are loaded, by either providing a custom trigger or manually calling the load() function.\n\nBuilding on top of this, Nuxt Scripts provides advanced triggers to make it even easier.\n\n- Consent Management - Load scripts only after the user has given consent such as with a cookie banner.\n- Element Event Triggers - Load scripts based on user interactions such as scrolling, clicking, or form submissions.\n\n```javascript\nconst cookieConsentTrigger = useScriptTriggerConsent()\nconst { proxy } = useScript<{ greeting: () => void }>('/hello.js', {\n  // script will only be loaded once the consent has been accepted\n  trigger: cookieConsentTrigger\n})\n// ...\nfunction acceptCookies() {\n  cookieConsentTrigger.accept()\n}\n// greeting() is queued until the user accepts cookies\nproxy.greeting()\n```\n\n## Bundling Scripts\n\nIn many cases, we're loading third-party scripts from a domain that we don't control. This can lead to a number of issues:\n\n- Privacy: The third-party script can track users across sites.\n- Security: The third-party script can be compromised and inject malicious code.\n- Performance: Extra DNS lookups will slow down the page load.\n- Developer Experience: Consented scripts may be blocked by ad blockers.\n\nTo mitigate this, Nuxt Scripts provides a way to bundle third-party scripts into your public directory without any extra work.\n\n```javascript\nuseScript('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/js-confetti@latest/dist/js-confetti.browser.js', {\n  bundle: true,\n})\n```\n\nThe script will now be served from /_scripts/{hash} on your own domain.\n\n## To be continued\n\nAs we saw, there are many opportunities to improve third-party scripts for developers and end-users.\n\nThe initial release of Nuxt Scripts has solved some of these issues, but there's still a lot of work ahead of us.\n\nThe next items on the roadmap are:\n\n- Add web worker support (Partytown)\n- More Live Chat Facade Components\n- Offload Scripts To Nuxt Server Proxy\n- Iframe Script Sandboxing\n\nWe'd love to have your contribution and support.\n\n## Getting started\n\nTo get started with Nuxt Scripts, we've created a tutorial to help you get up and running.\n\n## Credits\n\n- Harlan Wilton - Nuxt (author)\n- Julien Huang - Nuxt (contributor)\n- Daniel Roe - Nuxt (contributor)\n- Chrome Aurora - Google (contributor)\n\nAnd a big thank you to the early contributors.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/nuxt-scripts", "title": "Introducing Nuxt Scripts", "description": "Nuxt Scripts provides better performance, privacy, security, and developer experience for third-party scripts.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 13, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 01:11:37", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"twitter:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/nuxt-scripts/banner.png", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:description": "Nuxt Scripts provides better performance, privacy, security, and developer experience for third-party scripts.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "twitter:site": "nuxt_js", "ogDescription": "Nuxt Scripts provides better performance, privacy, security, and developer experience for third-party scripts.", "favicon": "https://nuxt.com/icon.png", "og:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/nuxt-scripts/banner.png", "og:type": "website", "ogTitle": "Introducing Nuxt Scripts ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "og:site_name": "Nuxt", "ogSiteName": "Nuxt", "twitter:image:src": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/nuxt-scripts/banner.png", "description": "Nuxt Scripts provides better performance, privacy, security, and developer experience for third-party scripts.", "twitter:image:height": "600", "og:image:height": "600", "theme-color": "#020420", "title": "Introducing Nuxt Scripts ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "og:title": "Introducing Nuxt Scripts ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "og:image:type": "image/png", "twitter:image:width": "1200", "og:image:width": "1200", "ogImage": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/nuxt-scripts/banner.png", "language": "en", "scrapeId": "8fdd2d62-efbb-4d77-ae56-74d11c454c42", "sourceURL": "https://nuxt.com/blog/nuxt-scripts", "url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/nuxt-scripts", "statusCode": 200}}}

The report shows that the top 10 third-party scripts average median blocking time is 1.4 seconds..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/nuxt-scripts", "title": "Introducing Nuxt Scripts", "description": "Nuxt Scripts provides better performance, privacy, security, and developer experience for third-party scripts.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 13, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 01:11:37", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"twitter:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/nuxt-scripts/banner.png", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:description": "Nuxt Scripts provides better performance, privacy, security, and developer experience for third-party scripts.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "twitter:site": "nuxt_js", "ogDescription": "Nuxt Scripts provides better performance, privacy, security, and developer experience for third-party scripts.", "favicon": "https://nuxt.com/icon.png", "og:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/nuxt-scripts/banner.png", "og:type": "website", "ogTitle": "Introducing Nuxt Scripts ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "og:site_name": "Nuxt", "ogSiteName": "Nuxt", "twitter:image:src": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/nuxt-scripts/banner.png", "description": "Nuxt Scripts provides better performance, privacy, security, and developer experience for third-party scripts.", "twitter:image:height": "600", "og:image:height": "600", "theme-color": "#020420", "title": "Introducing Nuxt Scripts ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "og:title": "Introducing Nuxt Scripts ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "og:image:type": "image/png", "twitter:image:width": "1200", "og:image:width": "1200", "ogImage": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/nuxt-scripts/banner.png", "language": "en", "scrapeId": "8fdd2d62-efbb-4d77-ae56-74d11c454c42", "sourceURL": "https://nuxt.com/blog/nuxt-scripts", "url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/nuxt-scripts", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful nuxt-blog expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what A New Website is in nuxt-blog?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain A New Website in nuxt-blog.\n\n# A New Website\n\nAnnouncement of the new nuxt.com website, powered by Nuxt UI and now open source.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## New Design\n\nWe are back to the original colors of Nuxt, with a navy background ( `#020420`) and its signature shiny green ( `#00DC82`). Discover the **Nuxt Design Kit** as well as our **Logo History**. We wanted to achieve a consistent design across all our official documentations.\n\n## Improved Navigation\n\nFrom now on, you can easily jump between the five main documentation categories. On the right side, you can see the table of contents as well as community shortcuts: Edit this page, Chat on Discord, etc.\n\n## Source Code Buttons\n\nWhen looking at Nuxt built-in [components](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/components), [composables](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables), [utils](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/utils), [commands](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/commands) and [kit utilities](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/kit), you can now jump to the source code by clicking on the Source button. Checkout an example on `<NuxtLink>` documentation page.\n\n## Improved Search Feature\n\nYou may notice a new modal when hitting `CMD+K`. We leverage the Nuxt UI [`<CommandPalette>`](https://ui.nuxt.com/navigation/command-palette) components combined with Nuxt Content data (search & navigation) to provide a better search experience. With the command palette, you can: - Jump to a page - Search in the documentation - Search a module - Switch the color mode. We plan to add more commands soon.\n\n## Migration to Nuxt UI\n\nThe new website is powered by [Nuxt UI](https://ui.nuxt.com/), our UI library tailored made for Nuxt and built on top of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) & [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/). The website also uses [Nuxt UI Pro](https://ui.nuxt.com/pro), a set of premium components built on top of Nuxt UI to create beautiful & responsive Nuxt applications in minutes. It includes components such as `<UHeader>`, `<UFooter>`, `<ULandingHero>`, `<ULandingCard>` and more. We plan to launch the full documentation of Nuxt UI Pro at the end of October. If you cannot wait and want early access, you can already [purchase a license](https://ui.nuxt.com/pro/purchase) now and get access to our private repository on GitHub. This [migration](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.com/pull/1365) was a great opportunity to improve Nuxt UI & UI Pro and fix some bugs, as well as a difference of +9,004 / -23,113 lines of code changed.\n\n## Open Graph Images\n\nWe are big fans of having a custom image when we share a link on social media. That's why we have added OG images on all our documentation pages. Example of the [Installation page](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/installation): Discover the **Nuxt OG Image** module.\n\n## Available on GitHub\n\nWe are proud to announce that the website is **now open source** and available on GitHub. Check out `nuxt/nuxt.com` on GitHub.\n\n## What's next?\n\nThis new website is the beginning of upcoming changes we are planing, some of them are: - Team & Contributors pages - Integrations page to showcase all the possibilities with Nuxt: Hosting, CMS, Database, etc. - Templates page (currently [nuxt.new](https://nuxt.new/)) to list official and community starters - And more... We are looking forward to your feedback on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nuxt_js), [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/nuxt) or [GitHub](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.com).

It's the first JavaScript application server that is portable across a variety of modern cloud hosting providers.\n\nIn production, it builds your Vue application and server into one universal `.output` directory. This output is light: minified and without any other Node.js dependencies (except polyfills). You can deploy this output on any system supporting JavaScript, whether Node.js, Serverless, Workers, Edge-side rendering or purely static.\n\n**Bonus:** this server engine can be used on existing Nuxt 2 projects with Nuxt Bridge üöÄ\n\nHead over the Nuxt 3 homepage to learn more about Nuxt Nitro and Nuxt Bridge.\n\n## Important notes\n\nNuxt 3 is currently in beta, so expect things to break (and be fixed quickly). We have plenty of work left but we want to open it publicly to gather feedback and contributions from the community üíö\n\n**Do not use it for production until we reach the first release candidate.**\n\nDuring the beta, almost every commit will trigger a new npm release; you may want to look at the merged pull requests until we begin generating automated changelogs in the documentation.\n\nWe are working every day to improve the documentation, explaining as much as possible all the concepts, features and usage of Nuxt 3.\n\nCheck out the community section of the Nuxt 3 website for getting help, reporting bugs or contributing to the framework.\n\n## Timeline\n\nHere some major milestones we've achieved on the way to Nuxt 3:\n\n- **Jul 2, 2020**: Nuxt 3 first commit with full TypeScript rewrite\n- **Aug 7, 2020**: Webpack 5 support\n- **Sep 15, 2020**: pages/ support\n- **Oct 29, 2020**: Vue 3 support with bundle-renderer\n- **Nov 2, 2020**: Nuxt Nitro initial work\n- **Jan 22, 2021**: Initial Vite support\n- **Feb 4, 2021**: Nuxt can deploy on major serverless platforms\n- **Mar 6, 2021**: UnJS organisation created on GitHub\n- **Mar 28, 2021**: Init Nuxt Kit and Nuxt CLI ( nuxi)\n- **May 20, 2021**: app.vue support ( pages/ becomes optional)\n- **Jun 30, 2021**: layouts/ support\n- **Jul 15, 2021**: Native ESM support\n- **Aug 10, 2021**: Auto import of composables and components\n- **Sep 5, 2021**: Init Nuxt Bridge for improving Nuxt 2 experience\n- **Sep 7, 2021**: Support Vite build for production\n- **Oct 11, 2021**: Add useState and useFetch composables\n\nSo far, we've merged 385 pull requests, closed 229 issues and made 925+ commits.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/nuxt3-rc", "title": "Announcing Nuxt 3 Release Candidate", "description": "Nuxt 3 beta was announced on October 12, 2021 after 16 months of work, introducing a new foundation based on Vue 3, Vite and Nitro.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful nuxt-blog expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Nuxt 3.14 is in nuxt-blog?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Nuxt 3.14 in nuxt-blog.\n\n# Nuxt 3.14\n\nNuxt 3.14 is out - with a new rspack builder, shared folder, and performance enhancements!Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Faster starts powered by `jiti`\n\nLoading the nuxt config file, as well as modules and other build-time code, is now powered by `jiti` v2. You can see more about the release in the jiti v2 release notes, but one of the most important pieces is native node esm import (where possible), which should mean a faster start.\n\n## Shared folder for code and types shared with client/server\n\nYou should never import Vue app code in your nitro code (or the other way around). But this has meant a friction point when it comes to sharing types or utilities that don't rely on the nitro/vue contexts. For this, we have a new `shared/` folder. You can't import Vue or nitro code into files in this folder, but it produces auto-imports (if you're using `compatibilityVersion: 4`) which you can consume throughout the rest of your app. If needed you can use the new `#shared` alias which points to this folder. The shared folder is alongside your `server/` folder.\n\n## `rspack` builder\n\nWe're excited to announce a new first-class Nuxt builder for `rspack`. It's still experimental but we've refactored the internal Nuxt virtual file system to use `unplugin` to make this possible. Let us know if you like it - and feel free to raise any issues you experience with it. To try it out, you can use this starter - or just install `@nuxt/rspack-builder` and set `builder: 'rspack'` in your nuxt config file.\n\n## New composables\n\nWe have new `useResponseHeader` and `useRuntimeHook` composables.\n\n## New module utilities\n\nWe now have a new `addServerTemplate` utility for adding virtual files for access inside nitro runtime routes.\n\n## v4 changes\n\nWe've merged some changes which only take effect with `compatibilityVersion: 4`, but which you can opt-into earlier. 1. previously, if you had a component like `~/components/App/Header.vue` this would be visible in your devtools as `<Header>`. From v4 we ensure this is `<AppHeader>`, but it's opt-in to avoid breaking any manual `<KeepAlive>` you might have implemented. 2. Nuxt scans page metadata from your files, before calling `pages:extend`. But this has led to some confusing behaviour, as pages added at this point do not end up having their page metadata respected. So we now do not scan metadata before calling `pages:extend`. Instead, we have a new `pages:resolved` hook, which is called after `pages:extend`, after all pages have been augmented with their metadata. I'd recommend opting into this by setting `experimental.scanPageMeta` to `after-resolve`, as it solves a number of bugs.\n\n## Roadmap to v3.15\n\nThey didn't quite make it in time for v3.14 but for the next minor release you can expect (among other things): - auto-imported directives from modules - 'isolated' page renders - delayed hydration.\n\n## Upgrading\n\nAs usual, our recommendation for upgrading is to run:\n\n```\nnpx nuxi@latest upgrade --force\n```\n\nThis will refresh your lockfile as well, and ensures that you pull in updates from other dependencies that Nuxt relies on, particularly in the unjs ecosystem.\n\n## Full Release Notes\n\nRead the full release notes of Nuxt `v3.14.0`. A huge thank you to everyone who's been a part of this release. We have exciting things in store with our next releases! Don't hesitate to let us know if you have any feedback or issues!\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-14", "title": "Nuxt 3.14", "description": "Nuxt 3.14 is out - with a new rspack builder, shared folder, and performance enhancements!", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 9, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 01:13:45", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "ogImage": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3.14.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og:image:height": "600", "og:type": "website", "ogTitle": "Nuxt 3.14 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "og:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3.14.png", "favicon": "https://nuxt.com/icon.png", "ogSiteName": "Nuxt", "twitter:site": "nuxt_js", "twitter:image:src": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3.14.png", "og:title": "Nuxt 3.14 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "twitter:image:height": "600", "og:description": "Nuxt 3.14 is out - with a new rspack builder, shared folder, and performance enhancements!", "title": "Nuxt 3.14 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "og:site_name": "Nuxt", "ogDescription": "Nuxt 3.14 is out - with a new rspack builder, shared folder, and performance enhancements!", "language": "en", "og:image:type": "image/png", "og:image:width": "1200", "twitter:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3.14.png", "theme-color": "#020420", "twitter:image:width": "1200", "description": "Nuxt 3.14 is out - with a new rspack builder, shared folder, and performance enhancements!", "scrapeId": "99c21961-fa35-4f87-83bc-2d05850c2c65", "sourceURL": "https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-14", "url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-14", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful nuxt-blog expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Nuxt 3.9 is in nuxt-blog?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Nuxt 3.9 in nuxt-blog.\n\n# Nuxt 3.9\n\nNuxt 3.9 is out - a Christmas gift from the Nuxt team bringing Vite 5, interactive server components, new composables, a new loading API and more.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Vite 5\n\nThis release comes with Vite 5 and Rollup 4 support. Module authors may need to check to ensure that any vite plugins you're creating are compatible with these latest releases.\n\nThis comes with a whole host of great improvements and bug fixes - check out the [the Vite changelog](https://vitejs.dev/guide/migration.html#migration-from-v4) for more info.\n\n## Vue 3.4 ready\n\nThis release is tested with the latest Vue 3.4 release candidate, and has the necessary configuration to take advantage of [new features in Vue 3.4](https://blog.vuejs.org/posts/vue-3-4), including debugging hydration errors in production (just set `debug: true`) in your Nuxt config.\n\nüëâ To take advantage, just update your `vue` version once v3.4 is released, or try out the release candidate today.\n\n## Interactive Server Components\n\nThis is a highly-experimental update, but it's now possible to play around with interactive components within Nuxt server components. You'll need to enable this new feature additionally to component islands.\n\n## Automatic Server Optimisations\n\nWe now use Vite's new AST-aware 'define' to perform more accurate replacements on server-side code, meaning code like this will no longer throw an error.\n\n## Granular Loading API\n\nWe now have a new hook-based system for [`<NuxtLoadingIndicator>`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/components/nuxt-loading-indicator), including a `useLoadingIndicator` composable that lets you control/stop/start the loading state. You can also hook into `page:loading:start` and `page:loading:end` if you prefer.\n\n## Run single events in callOnce\n\nSometimes you only want to run code once, no matter how many times you load a page - and you don't want to run it again on the client if it ran on the server.\n\n## Error Types\n\nFor a while now, errors returned by `useAsyncData` and `useFetch` have been typed pretty generically as `Error`. We've significantly improved the type possibilities for them to make them more accurate in terms of what you'll actually receive.\n\n## Schema Performance\n\nWe've taken some time in this release to make some minor performance improvements, so you should notice some things are a bit faster. This is an ongoing project and we have ideas for improving initial load time of the Nuxt dev server.\n\n## Upgrading\n\nAs usual, our recommendation for upgrading is to run:\n\n```\nnpx nuxi upgrade\n```\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-9", "title": "Nuxt 3.9", "description": "Nuxt 3.9 is out - a Christmas gift from the Nuxt team bringing Vite 5, interactive server components, new composables, a new loading API and more.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 9, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 01:14:22", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"ogTitle": "Nuxt 3.9 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "og:image:type": "image/png", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "twitter:site": "nuxt_js", "favicon": "https://nuxt.com/icon.png", "og:description": "Nuxt 3.9 is out - a Christmas gift from the Nuxt team bringing Vite 5, interactive server components, new composables, a new loading API and more.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og:image:width": "1200", "ogSiteName": "Nuxt", "title": "Nuxt 3.9 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "og:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3.9.png", "og:type": "website", "og:site_name": "Nuxt", "twitter:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3.9.png", "twitter:image:src": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3.9.png", "ogDescription": "Nuxt 3.9 is out - a Christmas gift from the Nuxt team bringing Vite 5, interactive server components, new composables, a new loading API and more.", "twitter:image:height": "600", "language": "en", "theme-color": "#020420", "twitter:image:width": "1200", "og:title": "Nuxt 3.9 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "description": "Nuxt 3.9 is out - a Christmas gift from the Nuxt team bringing Vite 5, interactive server components, new composables, a new loading API and more.", "ogImage": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3.9.png", "og:image:height": "600", "scrapeId": "f8af7584-7797-4893-82eb-dd2aef396338", "sourceURL": "https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-9", "url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-9", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful nuxt-blog expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Nuxt: A vision for 2023 is in nuxt-blog?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Nuxt: A vision for 2023 in nuxt-blog.\n\n# Nuxt: A vision for 2023\n\nThis past year has been an exciting one. Looking into the new year, there is a lot we have planned as a team and we'd love to share it with you.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Unifying Nuxt\n\nOne important change will be unifying Nuxt into a single repository.\n\nAs a complete rewrite of Nuxt 2, Nuxt 3 has been developed in a separate repository: `nuxt/framework`. Nuxt 3 even has its own documentation on [nuxt.com](http://nuxt.com/), versus the Nuxt 2 documentation on [v2.nuxt.com](https://v2.nuxt.com/). In development, this helped us move faster but meant less attention on issues for Nuxt 2. It's also a bit confusing.\n\nSo in the coming days, we'll be unifying the Nuxt repos into a single repository, `nuxt/nuxt`. We'll transfer all issues and discussions across, of course, clearly labeling them as to which version of Nuxt they affect. This will also provide us an opportunity to close out issues and RFCs that we've resolved or implemented in Nuxt 3.\n\n## New Website\n\nThis last year brought us the launch of [nuxt.com](http://nuxt.com/) and the unveiling of Nuxt's [new logo](https://nuxt.com/design-kit).\n\nWe'd like to make this website the central place for everything Nuxt. That includes:\n\n- migrating Nuxt 2 documentation so there's a single website to check (with a version switcher)\n- documentation for community modules (using multi-source to pull them from their own repositories)\n- revamped [examples](https://nuxt.com/docs/examples/hello-world) that show off more real use cases, including authentication, monorepos and more\n\nWe have some other exciting plans for the website, but I don't want to reveal too much, other than to say that we'll also (of course!) be open-sourcing the website soon.\n\n## Key Modules\n\nThe modules ecosystem is an incredibly powerful one, and we are grateful to all the module authors who extend Nuxt with so many features. Today we have more than 60 modules compatible with Nuxt 3. Our goal is to continue to empower module development as well as make sure that the most used modules in Nuxt 2 are updated or have a straightforward migration path.\n\nThe main priorities at the start of the year are `nuxt/image`, PWA and `nuxt/auth`.\n\nWe're also developing RFCs for `nuxt/font` and `nuxt/script` in conjunction with the Google Aurora team, which will make it much easier to apply best performance practices to your Nuxt apps. Watch this space!\n\n## DX and Performance\n\nWe particularly care a lot about making Nuxt a joy to use, and we'd like to keep pushing the boundary of great developer experience, which we believe results in the best experience for users of the apps we write too.\n\nIn the coming months, there will be a continued focus on developer experience and performance. Expect to see Nuxt DevTools and CLI improvements for scaffolding - and more. On the performance side, Nuxt 3 + Nitro is a game-changer for speed, performance, and customisability, and we‚Äôll be building on top of that to enable some amazing features. üöÄ\n\n## A New Release Cycle\n\nIt's important to know what's coming, and we're going to be spending some time making sure we communicate clearly about what's happening with Nuxt through regular updates like this one.\n\nOn top of that, we're planning a consistent release cycle, following [semver](https://semver.org/). We'll aim for major framework releases every year, with an expectation of patch releases every week or so and minor releases every month or so. They should never contain breaking changes except within options clearly marked as `experimental`.\n\nOne comment: We don't want there to be as big a gap (either in time or in breaking changes) between 3 -> 4 as there was between 2 -> 3, so, when the time comes for Nuxt 4, expect a much more gentle upgrade!\n\nIn the upcoming 3.1.0 release, you can already find a host of bug fixes as well as:\n\n- experimental server-only components and a component island renderer\n- Nitro 2, Vite 4 and Rollup 3 support\n\n## Migrating to Nuxt 3\n\nOn December 31st, 2023, Vue 2 will reach End of Life (EOL), and with it Nuxt 2. Both Vue and Nuxt will continue being available and working for many people, but at the same time, many companies and users will want to transition to Nuxt 3 (and we'd encourage this!).\n\nPart of our focus this year therefore will be supporting everyone who wants to migrate their apps to Nuxt 3. We'll also be working to backport key bug fixes and security fixes to Nuxt 2.\n\nIn addition, there is Nuxt Bridge. It was built as a module to bring features and bug fixes from Nuxt 3 back to Nuxt 2, although it has not yet been released in a stable version. We plan to stabilise and release it in the next month or so, but our main focus over the course of the year will be on helping people transition to Nuxt 3.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/vision-2023", "title": "Nuxt: A vision for 2023", "description": "This past year has been an exciting one.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful nuxt-blog expert.\n\nUser: How do I a new release cycle in nuxt-blog?\n\nAssistant: To a new release cycle in nuxt-blog, here's what you do:\nIt's important to know what's coming, and we're going to be spending some time making sure we communicate clearly about what's happening with Nuxt through regular updates like this one.\n\nOn top of that, we're planning a consistent release cycle, following [semver](https://semver.org/). We'll aim for major framework releases every year, with an expectation of patch releases every week or so and minor releases every month or so. They should never contain breaking changes except within options clearly marked as `experimental`.\n\nOne comment: We don't want there to be as big a gap (either in time or in breaking changes) between 3 -> 4 as there was between 2 -> 3, so, when the time comes for Nuxt 4, expect a much more gentle upgrade!\n\nIn the upcoming 3.1.0 release, you can already find a host of bug fixes as well as:\n\n- experimental server-only components and a component island renderer\n- Nitro 2, Vite 4 and Rollup 3 support.\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/vision-2023", "title": "Nuxt: A vision for 2023", "description": "This past year has been an exciting one.

Both Vue and Nuxt will continue being available and working for many people, but at the same time, many companies and users will want to transition to Nuxt 3 (and we'd encourage this!).\n\nPart of our focus this year therefore will be supporting everyone who wants to migrate their apps to Nuxt 3. We'll also be working to backport key bug fixes and security fixes to Nuxt 2.\n\nIn addition, there is Nuxt Bridge. It was built as a module to bring features and bug fixes from Nuxt 3 back to Nuxt 2, although it has not yet been released in a stable version. We plan to stabilise and release it in the next month or so, but our main focus over the course of the year will be on helping people transition to Nuxt 3..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/vision-2023", "title": "Nuxt: A vision for 2023", "description": "This past year has been an exciting one.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful nuxt-blog expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what The Evolution of Shiki v1.0 is in nuxt-blog?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain The Evolution of Shiki v1.0 in nuxt-blog.\n\n# The Evolution of Shiki v1.0\n\nShiki v1.0 came with many improvements and features - see how Nuxt drives the evolution of Shiki!Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Introduction\n\nShiki is a syntax highlighter that uses TextMate grammars and themes, the same engine that powers VS Code. It provides one of the most accurate and beautiful syntax highlighting for your code snippets. It was created by Pine Wu back in 2018, when he was part of the VS Code team. It started as an experiment to use Oniguruma to do syntax highlighting.\n\n## Shiki Example\n\nWhile Shiki is awesome, it's still a library that is designed to run on Node.js. This means it is limited to highlighting static code only and would have trouble with dynamic code, because Shiki doesn't work in the browser. In addition, Shiki relies on the WASM binary of Oniguruma, as well as a bunch of heavy grammar and theme files in JSON.\n\n## The Start\n\nNuxt is putting a lot effort in pushing the web to the edge, making the web more accessible with lower latency and better performance. Edge hosting services such as CloudFlare Workers are deployed all over the world. Users get the content from the nearest edge server without the round trips to the origin server which could be thousands of miles away.\n\n## The Fork - Shikiji\n\nKnowing this might fundamentally change the way Shiki works, and since we don't want to risk breaking the existing Shiki users with our experiments, I started a fork of Shiki called Shikiji. I rewrote the code from scratch while keeping the previous API design decisions in mind.\n\n## Merging Back\n\nI am a team member of Shiki and have helped to do releases from time to time. While Pine is the lead of Shiki, he was busy on other stuff and Shiki's iterations slowed down. During the experiments in Shikiji, I proposed a few improvements that could help Shiki acquire a modern structure.\n\n## Twoslash\n\nTwoslash is an integration tool to retrieve type information from TypeScript Language Services and generated to your code snippet. It essentially makes your static code snippet to have hover type information similar to your VS Code editor.\n\n## Integrations\n\nIf you want to give Shiki a try in your own website, here you can find some integrations that we have made.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nOur mission at Nuxt is not only to make a better framework for developers, but also to make the entire frontend and web ecosystem a better place.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/shiki-v1", "title": "The Evolution of Shiki v1.0", "description": "Shiki v1.0 came with many improvements and features - see how Nuxt drives the evolution of Shiki!", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 8, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 01:15:04", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"ogSiteName": "Nuxt", "twitter:site": "nuxt_js", "og:title": "The Evolution of Shiki v1.0 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "og:image:width": "1200", "title": "The Evolution of Shiki v1.0 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "og:image:type": "image/png", "ogImage": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/shiki-cover.png", "twitter:image:height": "600", "og:description": "Shiki v1.0 came with many improvements and features - see how Nuxt drives the evolution of Shiki!", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "language": "en", "og:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/shiki-cover.png", "description": "Shiki v1.0 came with many improvements and features - see how Nuxt drives the evolution of Shiki!", "og:image:height": "600", "favicon": "https://nuxt.com/icon.png", "twitter:image:src": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/shiki-cover.png", "twitter:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/shiki-cover.png", "theme-color": "#020420", "twitter:image:width": "1200", "ogTitle": "The Evolution of Shiki v1.0 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "ogDescription": "Shiki v1.0 came with many improvements and features - see how Nuxt drives the evolution of Shiki!", "og:site_name": "Nuxt", "og:type": "website", "scrapeId": "e6591b99-5774-4b56-bb6a-844f9640c1db", "sourceURL": "https://nuxt.com/blog/shiki-v1", "url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/shiki-v1", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful nuxt-blog expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Going Full Static is in nuxt-blog?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Going Full Static in nuxt-blog.\n\n# Going Full Static\n\nLong awaited features for JAMstack fans has been shipped in v2.13: full static export, improved smart prefetching, integrated crawler, faster re-deploy, built-in web server and new target option for config ‚ö°Ô∏èHere's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Too long to read\n\n1. Upgrade nuxt to `2.14.0`\n2. Set `target: 'static'` in your `nuxt.config.js`\n3. Run `nuxt generate`\n4. That's it ‚ú®\n\n_Bonus: you can run `nuxt start` to run a local server serving your generated static application._\n\nNote: in this video we are using `nuxt export` which has been deprecated in favor of `nuxt generate`.\n\n## History\n\nNuxt had the static generation feature with `nuxt generate` since [v0.3.2](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/releases/tag/v0.3.2) (November 2016), since then we have improved it in multiple ways but never achieved full static generation. Today I am excited to announce that full static export is now possible with Nuxt 2.13.\n\n## Current issues\n\n`nuxt generate` is mostly pre-rendering, when you navigate client-side, `asyncData` and `fetch` are called, _making a request to your API_. A lot of users asked to support a \"full static\" mode, meaning to not call these 2 hooks on navigation, since the next page has been already pre-rendered.\n\nAlso, the developer experience is not optimal:\n\n- You have access to `req` or `res` on SSR but not when running `nuxt generate`\n- `process.static` is `true` only when running `nuxt generate`, making it slow to develop Nuxt modules or plugins for static generation\n- You have to specify all your [dynamic routes](https://v2.nuxt.com/docs/features/file-system-routing#dynamic-routes) in `generate.routes`, making it harder since you don't have access to nuxt modules there.\n- You cannot test the [SPA fallback](https://v2.nuxt.com/docs/concepts/static-site-generation#spa-fallback) in development, the fallback is a client-only version of your Nuxt application that loads when hitting a 404 page\n- `nuxt generate` runs `nuxt build` by default, making it slower to generate your website if only your content changed\n\nNote that it was possible to have full static support with [nuxt-payload-extractor](https://github.com/DreaMinder/nuxt-payload-extractor) module but it was more verbose to use and had limitations.\n\n## New config option: `target`\n\nTo improve the user experience as well as telling Nuxt that you want to export your application to static hosting, we are introducing a `target` option in your `nuxt.config.js`:\n\n```\n<script setup>\n  import { ref, computed } from '#imports'\n\n  const count = ref(1)\n  const double = computed(() => count.value * 2)\n</script>\n```\n\nFull static doesn't work with `ssr: 'false'` (which is the same as the deprecated `mode: 'spa'`) as this is used for client-side rendering only (Single Page Applications).\n\nRunning `nuxt dev` with the static target will improve the developer experience:\n\n- Remove `req` & `res` from context\n- Fallback to client-side rendering on 404, errors and redirects (see [SPA fallback](https://v2.nuxt.com/docs/concepts/static-site-generation#spa-fallback))\n- `$route.query` will always be equal to `{}` on server-side rendering\n- `process.static` is `true`\n\nWe are also exposing `process.target` for modules author to add logic depending on the user target.\n\n## Smarter `nuxt generate`\n\nNow with `v2.14.0`, you can use `nuxt generate`, it will smartly know if it has to build or not.\n\n## Crazy fast static applications\n\n`nuxt generate` with `target: 'static'` will pre-render all your pages to HTML and save a payload file in order to mock `asyncData` and `fetch` on client-side navigation, this means **no** **more HTTP calls to your API on client-side navigation.** By extracting the page payload to a js file, **it also reduces the HTML size** served as well as preloading it (from the  in the header) for optimal performance.\n\nWe also improved the [smart prefetching](https://nuxt.com/blog/introducing-smart-prefetching) when doing full static, it will also fetch the payloads, making navigation instant üëÄ.\n\n## Crawler integrated\n\nOn top of that, it also has a crawler inside, detecting every relative link and generating it:\n\nIf you want to exclude a bunch of routes, use the [generate.exclude](https://v2.nuxt.com/docs/configuration-glossary/configuration-generate#exclude). You can keep using [generate.routes](https://v2.nuxt.com/docs/configuration-glossary/configuration-generate#routes) to add extra routes that the crawler could not detect.\n\nTo disable the crawler, set `generate.crawler: false` in your `nuxt.config.js`.\n\n## Faster re-deploy\n\nBy separating `nuxt build` and `nuxt export`, we are opening a new range of improvements: pre-render your pages only if you content has changed, this means: no webpack build ‚Üí faster re-deployments.\n\n## Smarter `nuxt start`\n\nOnce you statically generated your Nuxt app into `dist/`, use `nuxt start` to start a production HTTP server and serve your static app, supporting [SPA Fallback](https://v2.nuxt.com/docs/concepts/static-site-generation#spa-fallback).\n\nThis command is perfect to locally test your static application before pushing to your favorite static hosting provider.\n\n## Preview mode\n\nWe do support live preview out of the box to keep calling your API:\n\nplugins/preview.client.js\n\n```\nexport default async function ({ query, enablePreview }) {\n  if (query.preview) {\n    enablePreview()\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIt will automatically refresh the page data (calling `nuxtServerInit`, `asyncData` and `fetch`).\n\nWhen the preview mode is activated, `asyncData` and `fetch` original methods will be called.\n\n## Commands\n\nDepending of the `target`, you can run these commands.\n\n- `server`\n  - `nuxt dev`: Start the development server\n  - `nuxt build`: Bundle your Nuxt application for production\n  - `nuxt start`: Start the production server\n- `static`\n  - `nuxt dev`: Start the development server (static aware)\n  - `nuxt generate`: Bundle your Nuxt application for production if needed (static aware) and export your application to static HTML in `dist/` directory\n  - `nuxt start`: Serve your production application from `dist/`.\n\n## What to do next\n\nLearn more about how to move from `@nuxtjs/dotenv` to runtime config.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/going-full-static", "title": "Going Full Static", "description": "Long awaited features for JAMstack fans has been shipped in v2.13: full static export, improved smart prefetching, integrated crawler, faster re-deploy, built-in web server and new target option for config ‚ö°Ô∏è", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 12, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 01:18:04", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"ogSiteName": "Nuxt", "twitter:image:width": "1200", "ogImage": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/going-full-static.png", "og:site_name": "Nuxt", "title": "Going Full Static ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "ogDescription": "Long awaited features for JAMstack fans has been shipped in v2.13: full static export, improved smart prefetching, integrated crawler, faster re-deploy, built-in web server and new target option for config ‚ö°Ô∏è", "og:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/going-full-static.png", "og:image:width": "1200", "ogTitle": "Going Full Static ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "twitter:site": "nuxt_js", "favicon": "https://nuxt.com/icon.png", "og:description": "Long awaited features for JAMstack fans has been shipped in v2.13: full static export, improved smart prefetching, integrated crawler, faster re-deploy, built-in web server and new target option for config ‚ö°Ô∏è", "og:type": "website", "language": "en", "twitter:image:height": "600", "twitter:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/going-full-static.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og:image:type": "image/png", "twitter:image:src": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/going-full-static.png", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:image:height": "600", "theme-color": "#020420", "description": "Long awaited features for JAMstack fans has been shipped in v2.13: full static export, improved smart prefetching, integrated crawler, faster re-deploy, built-in web server and new target option for config ‚ö°Ô∏è", "og:title": "Going Full Static ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "scrapeId": "6449b7d1-f88a-4c3b-a634-e7569dc8852d", "sourceURL": "https://nuxt.com/blog/going-full-static", "url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/going-full-static", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful nuxt-blog expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Nuxt 2 Static Improvements is in nuxt-blog?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Nuxt 2 Static Improvements in nuxt-blog.\n\n# Nuxt 2 Static Improvements\n\nThis page covers the improvements introduced in Nuxt version 2.13 regarding static site generation, including the new `nuxt export` command and caching mechanisms for faster deployments.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Introduction\n\nWith Nuxt version 2.13, the full-static mode has been introduced. In addition, a new command `nuxt export` was added to pre-render your pages without triggering a webpack build with the goal to separate the rendering and build process. The only issue was that most Nuxt users weren't able to unleash the full potential of the separation... until now.\n\n## Faster Static Deployments\n\nWith v2.14, `nuxt generate` will automagically skip webpack build step when no code has been changed and use the previous build using cache. This will help to drastically improve static deployments time by avoiding unnecessary builds which is usually the most time-consuming part of generation process. Cache support is platform-agnostic and works on Netlify, Vercel, or any other CI/CD setup that is caching `node_modules`.\n\n## Generate time: cache vs full webpack build\n\nSee the comparison in seconds between two `nuxt generate`:\n\n- `Build` is when a webpack build is required\n- `Cache` is only when the content has changed (webpack build skipped)\n\nThe static site generation of our projects on content changes are now ~3.6x times faster üöÄ\n\nProject links: [Basic](https://github.com/pi0/nuxt-static-demo), [Strapi Module Docs](https://github.com/nuxt-community/strapi-module/tree/master/docs), [Content Module Docs](https://github.com/nuxt/content/tree/master/docs) and [Nuxt 2 Docs](https://github.com/nuxt/website-v2).\n\n## Using in your projects\n\n1. Update `nuxt` to the latest minor version, which is v2.14.\n\n   ```bash\n   npm update\n   ```\n\n2. Ensure `target` is `static` inside your `nuxt.config`\n\n   ```javascript\n   export default {\n     target: 'static'\n     // ...\n   }\n   ```\n\n   `nuxt generate` will behave as before to avoid breaking changes and provide legacy compatibility if you keep `target: ‚Äòserver‚Äô` or don't specify target.\n\n3. That‚Äôs it üôå\n\n   Now, the `nuxt generate` command will build the project only if necessary, which is the case when files inside the project have been changed. It will always re-render your routes to static HTML files, like `nuxt export` is doing already.\n\n   Now you only have to change your build command back from `nuxt build && nuxt export` to `nuxt generate` on the platform you are using. If you are using a CI, ensure that you are properly caching `node_modules`.\n\n## Excluding Files from Cache\n\nBy default, nuxt ignores these directories so if any change happens inside them, build will not be triggered:\n\n- Build directory ( `.nuxt/`)\n- Static directory ( `static/`)\n- Generate dist ( `dist/`)\n- `node_modules`\n- `README.md`\n- Hidden dotfiles (like `.npmrc`)\n\nYou can add more patterns using [generate.cache.ignore](https://v2.nuxt.com/docs/configuration-glossary/configuration-generate/#cache) option in nuxt.config:\n\n   ```javascript\n   export default {\n     generate: {\n       cache: {\n         ignore: [\n           // When something changed in the docs folder, do not re-build via webpack\n           'docs'\n         ]\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\nIt is also possible to use a function for `ignore` option to override default ignore entries.\n\n## Module Authors\n\nWhat if you are developing a nuxt module that is working with files that should not trigger a rebuild? The best example is for [@nuxt/content](https://content.nuxt.com/) module that reads markdown files from the repository. In this case, these files are used within a runtime module, which is the case when using `@nuxt/content`, the module itself can tell nuxt to ignore these files for you already so you don't have to do anything! Module authors can use the new `generate:cache:ignore` hook to do so:\n\n   ```javascript\n   nuxt.hook('generate:cache:ignore', ignore => ignore.push('content'))\n   ```\n\n## How it works\n\nWhen using the new `nuxt generate` with `static` target, a snapshot including checksum of non-ignored project files as well as nuxt version and some other configuration will be written `.nuxt/build.json`. In addition, we also move the build directory to `node_modules/.cache/nuxt`. Because `node_modules` is cached by all major platforms (Netlify, Vercel, ...) and common CI/CD scripts, this solution works out of the box without additional configuration.\n\nWhen `nuxt generate` is called subsequently, it will again create a checksum based on your project files and then compare it to the existing one inside `node_modules/.cache/nuxt/build.json`.\n\nIf they match, it means that nothing is changed that needs rebuild so we can directly start rendering pages.\n\nIf a mismatch is detected, it means that a full rebuild would be necessary. You can also see what file caused rebuild by checking console logs. After the build, nuxt generate will save the new checksum inside `.nuxt/build.json`. You can check full implementation [here](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/pull/7712).\n\n## Back to old school commands\n\nWith Nuxt v2.13, we introduced `nuxt export` and `nuxt serve` specially designed for the static target. With Nuxt v2.14, they are deprecated as `nuxt generate` and `nuxt start` is smart to detect the target and build when necessary.\n\nServer target:\n\n- `nuxt dev` = development server\n- `nuxt build` = build your application for production\n- `nuxt start` = start the production server (use it for Node.js hosting like Heroku, DigitalOcean, etc)\n\nStatic target:\n\n- `nuxt dev` = development server\n- `nuxt generate` = build if needed and statically export to `dist/`\n- `nuxt start` = serve the `dist/` directory like your static hosting would do (Netlify, Vercel, Surge, etc), great for testing before deploying.\n\n## What to do next\n\n- Upgrade your project to [nuxt@2.14.0](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/releases/tag/v2.14.0)\n- Use `nuxt generate` instead of `nuxt export`\n- Use `nuxt start` instead of `nuxt serve`\n- Enjoy fast deployments ü§ô\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/nuxt-static-improvements", "title": "Nuxt 2 Static Improvements", "description": "This page covers the improvements introduced in Nuxt version 2.13 regarding static site generation, including the new `nuxt export` command and caching mechanisms for faster deployments.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 9, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 01:19:40", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:type": "website", "twitter:image:height": "600", "twitter:site": "nuxt_js", "description": "With Nuxt version 2.13, the full-static mode has been introduced.

In addition, we also move the build directory to `node_modules/.cache/nuxt`. Because `node_modules` is cached by all major platforms (Netlify, Vercel, ...) and common CI/CD scripts, this solution works out of the box without additional configuration.\n\nWhen `nuxt generate` is called subsequently, it will again create a checksum based on your project files and then compare it to the existing one inside `node_modules/.cache/nuxt/build.json`.\n\nIf they match, it means that nothing is changed that needs rebuild so we can directly start rendering pages.\n\nIf a mismatch is detected, it means that a full rebuild would be necessary. You can also see what file caused rebuild by checking console logs. After the build, nuxt generate will save the new checksum inside `.nuxt/build.json`.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful nuxt-blog expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Nuxt DevTools v1.0 is in nuxt-blog?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Nuxt DevTools v1.0 in nuxt-blog.\n\n# Nuxt DevTools v1.0\n\nNuxt DevTools v1.0 is out, generally available to all Nuxt projects!Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## The Reasons We Built Nuxt DevTools\n\nOver the recent years, there has been an increasing focus on Developer Experience (DX). Tools and frameworks have been striving to improve the DX. Along the way, Nuxt introduced many innovative features and conventions to make your day-to-day development easier and more efficient.\n\nFor example, file-based routing, layout system, plugins, route middleware, composables auto-import, file-based server APIs, powerful module system and many more.\n\nNuxt is capable of creating various range of applications, from simple hobby projects to large scale applications, from simple client-rendered single-page applications to hybrid rendered sites with serverless functions on edge, etc. We provide those features and conventions to make it easier to support all those use cases and scenarios.\n\n## The Problem\n\nOut of all these benefits of having a powerful framework, we have to made some trade-offs. Sometimes, we have to sacrifice a bit of the transparency of the underlying implementation to make things easier to use.\n\nConventional abstractions are great things to transfer implementation complexity and make things easier to get more focus when building. On the other hand, they can also add extra burden for users to learn and understand what's going on under the hood. Leading also to implicitness, like where a auto-imported component is from, or how many modules is using a certain component, etc. It can also make things hard to debug.\n\nTrade-offs are inevitable. Generally we believe those trade-offs are worth it, as they would help organizing users' codebase and make it easier to maintain in the long run. In the meantime, we also want to compensate the transparency we lost by providing a tool to help you understand what's going on under the hood and make the learning curve smoother.\n\n## Features\n\nNuxt DevTools is a set of visual tools to help you understand your Nuxt app and improve the developer experience even further. It's created to provide better transparency between Nuxt and your app, find performance bottlenecks and help you manage your app and configuration.\n\n## In App DevTools\n\nFrom the overview, Nuxt DevTools is an in-app DevTools that lives alongside your app. It will show up as a floating panel that you can click to open.\n\nWe believe this is a better approach than the traditional browser extension DevTools, as it's:\n\n- Works across all browsers, and even on mobile devices! - The capability of browser extension DevTools are limited by the APIs each browsers provides, and also maintain multiple extensions would require a lot of effort. This approach would allow us to focus more on the functionality and features, while having it accessible to users on any browsers and devices.\n- Build tools integrations - Traditionally browser extension DevTools are only able to access the runtime context of your app and have no access to the build tools. Having the DevTools comes with Nuxt, allows us to communicate with the build tools and provide much more insights and features.\n- Avoid layout shifts - Having the DevTools as a floating panel would avoid the layout shifts when toggling the DevTools.\n\n## Pages View\n\nTo help improving the implicitness of file-based routing, we introduced the Pages View in DevTools. It lists all the pages that have been registered in your app, that you can easily test and navigate between them.\n\n## Components View\n\nThe Components tab shows all the components you are using in your app and where they are from. You can also search for them and go to the source code.\n\nIt also provides a graph view that show the relationship between components. You can filter the components to see the dependencies of a specific component. This could help to identify unintended dependencies and improve the performance and bundle size of pages.\n\n## Composables View\n\nComposables view shows all the auto-imported composables registered to Nuxt. You can see which files are importing them, and where they are from. Some entries can also provide short descriptions and documentation links.\n\n## Modules Management\n\nThe Modules tab shows all the modules that are registered in your app, with the links to their documentations and repositories.\n\nWe also provide the ability for you to search for and explore the modules from the community. And install them with a single click!\n\n## Static Assets Management\n\nThe Assets tab shows all the static assets under your public directory. It supports previewing images, videos, fonts, PDFs, and other files, that you can easily copy the URL or code snippet to use in your app. You may also drag and drop files to upload them directly from Nuxt DevTools.\n\n## Runtime Configs Editor\n\nThe Runtime Configs tab shows the runtime configs of your app and provides an interactive editor for you to play with different values.\n\n## Payload Editor\n\nSimilar to the Runtime Configs Editor, the Payload Editor allows you to edit the payload from composables like useState and useFetch to see what have been passed from server to client on server-side rendering.\n\n## Open Graph Preview\n\nOpen Graph plays an important role in social media sharing as well as SEO. In the traditional workflow, we usually need to first deploy our app to check if the Open Graph is working as expected on various social media platforms. With the Open Graph Preview, you can now preview the Open Graph in DevTools and update it live with an instant feedback loop.\n\nWe also help you check the Open Graph tags in your app and provide suggestions to improve them. You can copy the generated code snippet and paste it to your routes to fix them in one go.\n\n## Plugins Overview\n\nPlugins Overview list all the plugins registered in your app. As the plugins are executed in the runtime before your app renders, it's important to keep plugins performant and avoid blocking the rendering. We provide the execution time of each plugin and the total time of all plugins, so you can better identify the potential performance bottlenecks.\n\n## Timeline\n\nTimeline is a tool for you to check when and how each composable been called. Different from browser DevTools' performance tools, this tab only check the high-level composables combining with other events like route navigation, which is closer to day-to-day use. It also records the arguments and return values of each call, so you can better understand what's going on under the hood.\n\n## Production Build Analyzer\n\nWhile Nuxt DevTools is mostly focused on providing development tools, sometimes we might want to know how chunks are composed in production. The Build Analyzer allows you to fire up a production build and analyze the chunks and modules at any time and see how they are bundled. You can also do multiple builds on different branches to compare how your refactoring/changes affect the bundle size, etc.\n\n## Server API Playground\n\nNuxt provides a very convenient way to create server API functions with the server routes. Since in Nuxt we have that information, we are able to provide a playground for you to test and debug your server API functions, similar to tools like Postman. We list all the server APIs available in your app automatically. And we execute those functions within the same context of your app, so you don't need to manually set them up in external tools. As always, we also have code snippets for you to copy and paste into your app.\n\n## Embedded Full-feature VS Code\n\nThanks to the flexibility of our DevTools approach, we can leverage the power of the modern web to embed a full-featured VS Code right in the DevTools. In that VS Code, you can sign in to your account and synchronize your settings, and all the extensions just work as your normal VS Code client. This allows you to quickly edit your code without leaving your browser.\n\n## Component Inspector\n\nThe Inspector allows you to inspect the DOM tree and see which component is rendering it. Click to go to your editor for the specific line. Making it much easier to make changes without the requirement of understanding the project structure thoroughly.\n\n## Split Screens\n\nIn the recent releases, we introduced a split screen feature, that allows you to open two tabs side-by-side.\n\n## UI Customization\n\nIn DevTools setting, we provide a few options for you to customize the tabs you want to see, and the layout of the DevTools.\n\n## Ecosystem\n\nIn Nuxt, we value the ecosystem a lot. Similar to how Nuxt modules enhance Nuxt core, we also designed Nuxt DevTools to be highly extensible, allowing modules to provide additional features and integrations.\n\n## Community Modules\n\nWe are proud to see the community has already started to build modules for Nuxt DevTools. Here are some of them:\n\nVitest module provides Vitest UI for tests running with the same pipeline as your Nuxt app. Made it easier to debug your tests alongside your app.\n\nVueUse module provides a search page for available composables and see their documentation.\n\nSiteMap module provides an interactive editor for you to manage your sitemap.\n\nTailwindCSS module provides the Tailwind Config Viewer for you to check what's available based on your config.\n\nUnoCSS module provides an interactive inspector to see how each module contributes to the final CSS.\n\nStorybook module provides a Storybook UI for your components.\n\n## Projects Inspired by Nuxt DevTools\n\nIn the meantime, we are also flattered that other frameworks are starting to build their own DevTools inspired by Nuxt DevTools:\n\nwebfansplz/vite-plugin-vue-devtools - A Nuxt DevTools port to support DevTools for Vite + Vue 3 apps.\n\npheno-agency/vite-plugin-devtools - An experiment on building framework-agnostic DevTools for Vite.\n\nModern.js DevTools - In App DevTools for Modern.js\n\nQwik DevTools - DevTools for Qwik.\n\n## What's Next\n\nNuxt DevTools just reached v1.0, but it doesn't mean we are done. There are still a lot of things we want to explore and improve. Here are some of the ideas we are considering:\n\n- Nuxt Accessibility Integration - We are building an a11y integration for Nuxt. We'll build a dedicated view in Nuxt DevTools for you to check the accessibility hints interactively.\n- Vue DevTools Integration - We are working with the Vue team to bring the Vue DevTools experience to a shared tool that works for both browser extensions and in-app DevTools like vite-plugin-vue-devtools and Nuxt DevTools.\n\n## The Future\n\nWe are excited to see how Nuxt DevTools can help you build better apps and improve your developer experience. Going forward, we are imagining something bigger than Nuxt DevTools itself. We believe that having such framework-specific DevTools is the way onwards to provide even better developer experience.\n\n## DevTools Kit\n\nDevTools Kit is an idea of the universal protocol that is still in the early brainstorming phase. We imagine that in the best world, each feature of the DevTools should be composable, extensible, and collaborative.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe hope you enjoy the new Nuxt DevTools experience! We are looking forward to seeing how it can help you build better apps and improve your developer experience. If you have any ideas or suggestions, feel free to let us know in the Ideas & Suggestions discussion.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/nuxt-devtools-v1-0", "title": "Nuxt DevTools v1.0", "description": "Nuxt DevTools v1.0 is out, generally available to all Nuxt projects!", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 27, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 01:27:49", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:title": "Nuxt DevTools v1.0 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "title": "Nuxt DevTools v1.0 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "description": "Nuxt DevTools v1.0 is out, generally available to all Nuxt projects!", "og:image:height": "600", "twitter:site": "nuxt_js", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:site_name": "Nuxt", "ogImage": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/nuxt-devtools-1-0.png", "og:description": "Nuxt DevTools v1.0 is out, generally available to all Nuxt projects!", "og:image:type": "image/png", "twitter:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/nuxt-devtools-1-0.png", "favicon": "https://nuxt.com/icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og:image:width": "1200", "twitter:image:height": "600", "og:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/nuxt-devtools-1-0.png", "language": "en", "ogTitle": "Nuxt DevTools v1.0 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "ogDescription": "Nuxt DevTools v1.0 is out, generally available to all Nuxt projects!", "ogSiteName": "Nuxt", "twitter:image:src": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/nuxt-devtools-1-0.png", "twitter:image:width": "1200", "theme-color": "#020420", "og:type": "website", "scrapeId": "92d175c4-1ed1-4d34-861b-a0131345e6ae", "sourceURL": "https://nuxt.com/blog/nuxt-devtools-v1-0", "url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/nuxt-devtools-v1-0", "statusCode": 200}}}

Tools and frameworks have been striving to improve the DX. Along the way, Nuxt introduced many innovative features and conventions to make your day-to-day development easier and more efficient.\n\nFor example, file-based routing, layout system, plugins, route middleware, composables auto-import, file-based server APIs, powerful module system and many more.\n\nNuxt is capable of creating various range of applications, from simple hobby projects to large scale applications, from simple client-rendered single-page applications to hybrid rendered sites with serverless functions on edge, etc. We provide those features and conventions to make it easier to support all those use cases and scenarios..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/nuxt-devtools-v1-0", "title": "Nuxt DevTools v1.0", "description": "Nuxt DevTools v1.0 is out, generally available to all Nuxt projects!", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 27, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 01:27:49", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"og:title": "Nuxt DevTools v1.0 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "title": "Nuxt DevTools v1.0 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "description": "Nuxt DevTools v1.0 is out, generally available to all Nuxt projects!", "og:image:height": "600", "twitter:site": "nuxt_js", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:site_name": "Nuxt", "ogImage": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/nuxt-devtools-1-0.png", "og:description": "Nuxt DevTools v1.0 is out, generally available to all Nuxt projects!", "og:image:type": "image/png", "twitter:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/nuxt-devtools-1-0.png", "favicon": "https://nuxt.com/icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og:image:width": "1200", "twitter:image:height": "600", "og:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/nuxt-devtools-1-0.png", "language": "en", "ogTitle": "Nuxt DevTools v1.0 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "ogDescription": "Nuxt DevTools v1.0 is out, generally available to all Nuxt projects!", "ogSiteName": "Nuxt", "twitter:image:src": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/nuxt-devtools-1-0.png", "twitter:image:width": "1200", "theme-color": "#020420", "og:type": "website", "scrapeId": "92d175c4-1ed1-4d34-861b-a0131345e6ae", "sourceURL": "https://nuxt.com/blog/nuxt-devtools-v1-0", "url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/nuxt-devtools-v1-0", "statusCode": 200}}}
{"text": "System: You are a helpful nuxt-blog expert.\n\nUser: How do I the problem in nuxt-blog?\n\nAssistant: To the problem in nuxt-blog, here's what you do:\nOut of all these benefits of having a powerful framework, we have to made some trade-offs. Sometimes, we have to sacrifice a bit of the transparency of the underlying implementation to make things easier to use.\n\nConventional abstractions are great things to transfer implementation complexity and make things easier to get more focus when building. On the other hand, they can also add extra burden for users to learn and understand what's going on under the hood. Leading also to implicitness, like where a auto-imported component is from, or how many modules is using a certain component, etc. It can also make things hard to debug.\n\nTrade-offs are inevitable. Generally we believe those trade-offs are worth it, as they would help organizing users' codebase and make it easier to maintain in the long run. In the meantime, we also want to compensate the transparency we lost by providing a tool to help you understand what's going on under the hood and make the learning curve smoother..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/nuxt-devtools-v1-0", "title": "Nuxt DevTools v1.0", "description": "Nuxt DevTools v1.0 is out, generally available to all Nuxt projects!", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 27, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 01:27:49", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"og:title": "Nuxt DevTools v1.0 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "title": "Nuxt DevTools v1.0 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "description": "Nuxt DevTools v1.0 is out, generally available to all Nuxt projects!", "og:image:height": "600", "twitter:site": "nuxt_js", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:site_name": "Nuxt", "ogImage": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/nuxt-devtools-1-0.png", "og:description": "Nuxt DevTools v1.0 is out, generally available to all Nuxt projects!", "og:image:type": "image/png", "twitter:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/nuxt-devtools-1-0.png", "favicon": "https://nuxt.com/icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og:image:width": "1200", "twitter:image:height": "600", "og:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/nuxt-devtools-1-0.png", "language": "en", "ogTitle": "Nuxt DevTools v1.0 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "ogDescription": "Nuxt DevTools v1.0 is out, generally available to all Nuxt projects!", "ogSiteName": "Nuxt", "twitter:image:src": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/nuxt-devtools-1-0.png", "twitter:image:width": "1200", "theme-color": "#020420", "og:type": "website", "scrapeId": "92d175c4-1ed1-4d34-861b-a0131345e6ae", "sourceURL": "https://nuxt.com/blog/nuxt-devtools-v1-0", "url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/nuxt-devtools-v1-0", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful nuxt-blog expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Nuxt on the Edge is in nuxt-blog?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Nuxt on the Edge in nuxt-blog.\n\n# Nuxt on the Edge\n\nLearn how we made Nuxt 3 capable of running on edge runtimes to run with server-side rendering close to your users.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn September 2017, Cloudflare introduced Cloudflare Workers, giving the ability to run JavaScript on their edge network. This means your code will deploy on the entire edge network in over a hundred locations worldwide in about 30 seconds. This technology allows you to focus on writing your application close to your users, wherever they are in the world (~50ms latency).\n\nThe worker's runtime is not the same as Node.js or the Browser, it executes the code using V8, the JavaScript engine developed by Google Chrome. Until now, what you could run on their platform were small scripts running on the edge before hitting your server to increase the performance or add some logic based on request headers, for example.\n\nIn November 2020, while working on Nuxt 3, we made the bet to run Nuxt in-production on edge runtimes / V8 isolates. It unlocks the ability to server-render pages in ~50ms from all over the world when using a platform like CloudFlare Workers, without having to deal with servers, load balancers and caching, for about $0.3 per million requests. As of today, new platforms are coming to let run apps on V8 isolates such as Deno Deploy.\n\n2024 update: I released NuxtHub to let you build full-stack applications with Nuxt on the edge, on your Cloudflare account with zero configuration. It includes a database, blob storage, KV, remote storage and more.\n\n## The Challenge\n\nIn order to make Nuxt run in workers, we had to rewrite some parts of Nuxt to be environmentally agnostic (runs in Node.js, Browser or V8).\n\nWe started with our server and created unjs/h3: a minimal http framework built for high performance and portability. It replaces Connect we used in Nuxt 2 but has compatibility with it so you can keep using Connect/Express middleware. In the workers, for each incoming request, it starts Nuxt in production, sends the request to it and sends back the response.\n\nIn Nuxt 2, the duration to start the server in production in memory (also named cold start) was about ~300ms, because we had to load all the dependencies of your server and application in order to handle the request.\n\nBy working on h3, we decided to code-split each handler attached to the server and lazy-load them only when requested. When you start Nuxt 3, we only load h3 in memory and the corresponding handlers. When a request comes in, we load the handler corresponding to the route and execute it.\n\nBy adopting this approach, we reduced the cold start from ~300ms to ~2ms.\n\nWe had another challenge in order to run Nuxt on the edge: the production bundle size. This includes the server, Vue app and Node.js dependencies combined. Cloudflare workers currently have a limit of 1MB (free plan) and 5MB ($5 per month plan) for the worker size.\n\nIn order to achieve this, we created unjs/nitro, our server engine, when running the nuxt build command, it bundles your whole project and includes all dependencies into the final output. It uses Rollup and vercel/nft to trace only the code used by the node_modules to remove unnecessary code. The total size of the generated output for a basic Nuxt 3 application is about 700kB gzip.\n\nLastly, to provide the same developer experience between development (Node.js) and production on Cloudflare (Edge runtime), we created unjs/unenv: a library to convert JavaScript code to run everywhere (platform agnostic) by mocking or adding polyfills for known dependencies.\n\nAt Nuxt, we believe that you should have the freedom to choose the hosting provider that fits you best. This is why you can deploy a Nuxt application with edge-side rendering on:\n- NuxtHub\n- Cloudflare Page\n- Deno Deploy\n- Vercel Edge Functions (using CloudFlare Workers under the hood)\n- Netlify Edge Functions (using Deno under the hood)\n\nWe also support many other deployment providers, including static hosting or traditional Node.js serverless and server hosts.\n\n## Pushing Full-stack Capabilities\n\nNow that we have Nuxt running on edge runtime, we can do more than render a Vue application. Thanks to the server directory, creating an API route is a TypeScript file away.\n\nTo add the /api/hello route, create a server/api/hello.ts file:\n\nserver/api/hello.ts\n\n```javascript\nexport default defineEventHandler((event) => {\n  return {\n    hello: 'world'\n  }\n})\n```\n\nYou can now universally call this API in your pages and components:\n\npages/index.vue\n\n```javascript\n<script setup>\nconst { data } = await useFetch('/api/hello')\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <pre>{{ data }}</pre>\n</template>\n```\n\nOne important thing to note when we created useFetch and $fetch is that during server-side rendering, if you call your API routes, it will emulate the request and call the function code directly: avoiding an HTTP request and reducing page‚Äôs rendering time.\n\nIn terms of developer experience, you will notice that when creating server files, the Nuxt server keeps running without rebuilding the Vue app. This is because Nuxt 3 supports Hot Module Replacement (HMR) when creating API and server routes.\n\nFurthermore, by leveraging Object Relational Mapping (ORM) like drizzle-orm, developers can connect Edge & Serverless databases such as D1, Turso, Neon, Planetscale and more.\n\nI created Atidone, an open source demo to showcase a full-stack application with authentication and a database running on the edge. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license at atinux/atidone.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe are excited about edge-side rendering and what it unlocks. Our team at Nuxt can‚Äôt wait to see what you will build on top of this!\n\nFeel free to join our Discord server or mention @nuxt_js on Twitter to share your work.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/nuxt-on-the-edge", "title": "Nuxt on the Edge", "description": "Learn how we made Nuxt 3 capable of running on edge runtimes to run with server-side rendering close to your users.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 4, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 01:29:30", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"ogImage": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/nuxt-on-the-edge.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ogSiteName": "Nuxt", "twitter:image:width": "1200", "twitter:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/nuxt-on-the-edge.png", "og:image:height": "600", "og:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/nuxt-on-the-edge.png", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "favicon": "https://nuxt.com/icon.png", "twitter:image:src": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/nuxt-on-the-edge.png", "og:image:type": "image/png", "ogTitle": "Nuxt on the Edge ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "description": "Learn how we made Nuxt 3 capable of running on edge runtimes to run with server-side rendering close to your users.", "title": "Nuxt on the Edge ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "theme-color": "#020420", "twitter:image:height": "600", "ogDescription": "Learn how we made Nuxt 3 capable of running on edge runtimes to run with server-side rendering close to your users.", "og:type": "website", "og:image:width": "1200", "og:title": "Nuxt on the Edge ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "og:description": "Learn how we made Nuxt 3 capable of running on edge runtimes to run with server-side rendering close to your users.", "language": "en", "og:site_name": "Nuxt", "twitter:site": "nuxt_js", "scrapeId": "b4f4e4b4-123a-4a7d-8c54-8c903a8c04af", "sourceURL": "https://nuxt.com/blog/nuxt-on-the-edge", "url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/nuxt-on-the-edge", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful nuxt-blog expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Introducing Nuxt Icon v1 is in nuxt-blog?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Introducing Nuxt Icon v1 in nuxt-blog.\n\n# Introducing Nuxt Icon v1\n\nDiscover Nuxt Icon v1 - a modern, versatile, and customizable icon solution for your Nuxt projects.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Why Are Icons Challenging?\n\nAt first glance, icons seem simple - they are essentially just tiny image elements that enhance a user interface, providing visual cues and enhancing usability. However, from an engineering perspective, they pose several challenges. Ideal icons should be:\n\n- **Colorable**: Adaptable to themes and color schemes.\n- **Scalable**: Render crisply at various sizes and resolutions.\n- **Manageable**: Icon sets can contain hundreds or thousands of icons.\n- **Efficiently Bundled**: Minimize network requests.\n- **Optimally Loaded**: Affect application performance and user experience.\n- **Dynamic**: Support dynamic loading for user-generated or runtime-defined icons.\n\n## A Journey Through Icon Solutions\n\nOver the years, developers have experimented with various techniques to render icons efficiently. Let‚Äôs explore the evolution of these solutions and the challenges they faced.\n\n## 1. `<img>` Tags: The Early Days\n\nThe most straightforward solution: using the `<img>` tag. This was the go-to method in the early days of the web. You'd host your image assets and use an `<img>` tag to link to that image, specifying its width and height. It's simple, requires no setup or runtime dependencies, and works natively in browsers. However, there are drawbacks. Images can become pixelated, lack color control, and don't scale well. Each icon being a separate image file results in many network requests, which could be slow, especially back in the days of HTTP 1.1.\n\n## 2. Web Fonts: Icon Fonts\n\nAs the next step in icon evolution, web fonts emerged as a popular solution. Fonts are inherently vectorized and colorable, making them a natural fit for icons. Iconset providers typically compile their icons into a special font file, assigning a unique Unicode character to each icon. This is accompanied by a CSS file that maps these Unicode values to specific icon classes. The advantages of this approach are clear: it's easy to use, colorable, scalable, and requires only a single request to load all icons.\n\n## 3. Inline SVGs: Component-Based Icons\n\nWith the advent of modern frontend frameworks, reusing HTML elements has become significantly easier. This led to the idea of directly inlining SVG tags as components. To support this approach, many icon sets provide packages with wrappers tailored for each framework. For instance, MDI icons use a shared component and pass icon data as props, while Tabler icons offer a dedicated component for each icon.\n\n## 4. Iconify Runtime: Dynamic API Access\n\nIconify revolutionized icon usage by aggregating over 200,000 icons across 100+ collections. Its runtime solution dynamically fetched icons via an API, enabling dynamic access to any icon without pre-bundling.\n\n## 5. On-Demand Component Icons\n\nWith the unified interface from Iconify and Vite's on-demand approach, we developed `unplugin-icons`. This tool allows you to import any icons as components on-demand.\n\n## 6. Pure CSS Icons\n\nAs a side-effect of working on UnoCSS, we discovered the potential of embedding icons entirely in CSS, leading to the innovative solution of Pure CSS Icons. This method involves inlining SVG icons as data URLs and providing a single class to display the icons.\n\n## The Challenges to Integrate in Nuxt\n\nWhile I would say that the Pure CSS Icons and On-demand Component Icons would be pretty sufficient for most of the static usages, Nuxt as a full featured framework, has a bit more requirements to integrate icons efficiently.\n\n## Introducing Nuxt Icon v1: The Balance of Both Worlds\n\nWith the flexibility of the Nuxt Module system, Nuxt Icon combines the best of both worlds: the instant rendering of CSS icons and the dynamic fetching of Iconify icons.\n\n## Dual Rendering Modes\n\nTo address the trade-offs in rendering approaches, Nuxt Icon introduces a versatile `<Icon>` component that supports both CSS and SVG modes, both of which are SSR-friendly.\n\n## Icon Bundles\n\nDynamic icons present unique challenges, especially when it comes to loading them efficiently. To address this, we leverage Iconify's API, which allows us to serve any icon on demand via network requests.\n\n## Data Flow\n\nHere is a data flow diagram illustrating how Nuxt Icon requests icon data.\n\n## Try Nuxt Icon Today\n\nNuxt Icon v1 represents the culmination of years of innovation in icon rendering. Whether you‚Äôre building a dynamic app, a static website, or anything in between, Nuxt Icon adapts to your needs.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/nuxt-icon-v1-0", "title": "Introducing Nuxt Icon v1", "description": "Discover Nuxt Icon v1 - a modern, versatile, and customizable icon solution for your Nuxt projects.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 14, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 01:32:10", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:title": "Introducing Nuxt Icon v1 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "twitter:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/nuxt-icon/cover.png", "twitter:image:width": "1200", "twitter:image:height": "600", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "ogTitle": "Introducing Nuxt Icon v1 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "og:site_name": "Nuxt", "og:description": "Discover Nuxt Icon v1 - a modern, versatile, and customizable icon solution for your Nuxt projects.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ogDescription": "Discover Nuxt Icon v1 - a modern, versatile, and customizable icon solution for your Nuxt projects.", "og:type": "website", "language": "en", "ogSiteName": "Nuxt", "og:image:type": "image/png", "og:image:width": "1200", "favicon": "https://nuxt.com/icon.png", "ogImage": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/nuxt-icon/cover.png", "og:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/nuxt-icon/cover.png", "twitter:image:src": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/nuxt-icon/cover.png", "title": "Introducing Nuxt Icon v1 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "theme-color": "#020420", "twitter:site": "nuxt_js", "description": "Discover Nuxt Icon v1 - a modern, versatile, and customizable icon solution for your Nuxt projects.", "og:image:height": "600", "scrapeId": "428ce31e-8f46-4366-b9e0-2777bfff1d92", "sourceURL": "https://nuxt.com/blog/nuxt-icon-v1-0", "url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/nuxt-icon-v1-0", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful nuxt-blog expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Understanding how fetch works in Nuxt 2.12 is in nuxt-blog?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Understanding how fetch works in Nuxt 2.12 in nuxt-blog.\n\n# Understanding how fetch works in Nuxt 2.12\n\nExplore different features of the fetch hook and learn a brand new way to bring data into Nuxt applications.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Fetch Hook and Nuxt Lifecycle\n\nIn terms of Nuxt lifecycle hooks, `fetch` sits within Vue lifecycle after `created` hook. As we already know that, all Vue lifecycle hooks are called with their `this` context. The same applies to `fetch` hook as well.\n\nFetch hook is called after the component instance is created on the server-side. That makes `this` context available inside the `fetch`.\n\n## Page Components\n\nWith the help of `this` context, fetch is able to mutate component‚Äôs data directly. It means we can set the component‚Äôs local data without having to dispatch Vuex store action or committing mutation from the page component.\n\nAs a result, Vuex becomes optional, but not impossible. We can still use `this.$store` as usual to access Vuex store if required.\n\n## Availability of fetch hook\n\nWith `fetch`, we can prefetch the data asynchronously **in any Vue components**. It means, other than page components found in `/pages` directory, every other `.vue` components found in `/layouts` and `/components` directories can also benefit from the fetch hook.\n\n## Layout Components\n\nUsing new `fetch`, now we can make API calls directly from the layout components. This was impossible prior to the release of v2.12.\n\n**Possible use cases**\n- Fetch config data from the back-end in Nuxt layouts to generate footer and navbar dynamically\n- Fetch user related data (i.e. user profile, shopping-cart item count) in the navbar\n- Fetch site relevant data on `layouts/error.vue`\n\n## Building-block (Child/Nested) Components\n\nWith `fetch` hook available in child components as well, we can off-load some of the data-fetching tasks from page-level components, and delegate them over to nested components. This was also impossible prior to the release of v2.12.\n\nThis reduces the responsibility of route-level components to a great extent.\n\n**Possible use case -** We can still pass props to child components, but if the child components need to have their own data-fetching logic, now they can!\n\n## Call order of multiple fetch hooks\n\nSince each component can have its own data-fetching logic, you may ask what would be the order in which each of them are called?\n\nFetch hook is called on server-side once (on the first request to the Nuxt app) and then on client-side when navigating to further routes. But since we can define one fetch hook for each component, fetch hooks are called in sequence of their hierarchy.\n\n## Disabling fetch on server-side\n\nIn addition, we can even disable fetch on the server-side if required.\n\n```\nexport default {\n  fetchOnServer: false\n}\n```\n\nAnd this way, the fetch hook will only be called on client-side. When `fetchOnServer` is set to false, `$fetchState.pending` becomes `true` when the component is rendered on server-side.\n\n## Error Handling\n\nNew `fetch` handles error at component level. Let‚Äôs see how.\n\nBecause we‚Äôre fetching data asynchronously, the new fetch() provides a `$fetchState` object to check whether the request has finished and progressed successfully.\n\nBelow is what the `$fetchState` object looks like.\n\n```\n$fetchState = {\n  pending: true | false,\n  error: null | {},\n  timestamp: Integer\n};\n```\n\nWe have three keys,\n\n1. **Pending -** lets you display a placeholder when fetch is being called on client-side\n2. **Error -** lets you show an error message\n3. **Timestamp -** shows timestamp of the last fetch which is useful for caching with `keep-alive`\n\nThese keys are then used directly in the template area of the component to show relevant placeholders during the process of fetching data from the API.\n\n```\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <p v-if=\"$fetchState.pending\">Fetching posts...</p>\n    <p v-else-if=\"$fetchState.error\">Error while fetching posts</p>\n    <ul v-else>\n      ‚Ä¶\n    </ul>\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\nWhen error occurs at **component-level**, we can set HTTP status code on server-side by checking `process.server` in fetch hook and follow it up with `throw new Error()` statement.\n\n```\nasync fetch() {\n  const post = await fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/${this.$route.params.id}`)\n                     .then((res) => res.json())\n\n  if (post.id === this.$route.params.id) {\n      this.post = post\n    } else {\n      // set status code on server and\n      if (process.server) {\n        this.$nuxt.context.res.statusCode = 404\n      }\n      // use throw new Error()\n      throw new Error('Post not found')\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSetting the HTTP status code this way **is useful for correct SEO**.\n\n## Fetch as a method\n\nNew fetch hook also acts as a method that can be invoked upon user interaction or invoked programmatically from the component methods.\n\n```\n<!-- from template in template  -->\n<button @click=\"$fetch\">Refresh Data</button>\n```\n\n```javascript\n// from component methods in script section\nexport default {\n  methods: {\n    refresh() {\n      this.$fetch()\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n## Making Nuxt pages more performant\n\nWe can use `:keep-alive-props` prop and `activated` hook to make Nuxt page components more performant using a new fetch hook.\n\nNuxt allows **caching a certain number of pages** in the memory along with their fetched data. And also allows **adding a number of seconds** before we can re-fetch the data.\n\nFor any of the above methods to work, we have to use the `keep-alive` prop in generic `<nuxt />` and `<nuxt-child` \u001e components.\n\nlayouts/default.vue\n\n```\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <nuxt keep-alive />\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\nIn addition, we can pass `:keep-alive-props` to `<nuxt />` component to cache a number of pages along with their fetched data.\n\n`:keep-alive-props` prop allow us to indicate the maximum number of pages that should be kept in the memory while we navigate elsewhere within the site.\n\nlayouts/default.vue\n\n```\n<nuxt keep-alive :keep-alive-props=\"{ max: 10 }\" />\n```\n\nAbove is one way to boost page performance which is more high-level and generic, while the next one drills down to optimize the fetch request calls by using the `timestamp` property of `$fetchState` and comparing it against the number of seconds delay before it re-fetches the data.\n\nVue‚Äôs `activated` hook is used here with Nuxt's `keep-alive` prop to re-fetch the data.\n\n```\nexport default {\n  activated() {\n    // Call fetch again if last fetch more than a minute ago\n    if (this.$fetchState.timestamp <= Date.now() - 60000) {\n      this.$fetch()\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n## asyncData vs Fetch\n\nAs far as page components are concerned, new `fetch` seems way too similar to `asyncData()` because they both deal with the local data. But there are some key differences worth taking note of as below.\n\nAs of Nuxt 2.12, `asyncData` method is still an active feature. Let‚Äôs examine some of the key differences between `asyncData` and new `fetch`.\n\n## asyncData\n\n1. `asyncData` is limited to only page-level components\n2. `this` context is unavailable\n3. Adds payload by **returning** the data\n\n```\nexport default {\n  async asyncData(context) {\n    const data = await context.$axios.$get(\n      `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos`\n    )\n    // `todos` does not have to be declared in data()\n    return { todos: data.Item }\n    // `todos` is merged with local data\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n## New Fetch\n\n1. `fetch` is available in all Vue components\n2. `this` context is available\n3. Simply **mutates** the local data\n\n```\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      todos: []\n    }\n  },\n  async fetch() {\n    const { data } = await axios.get(\n      `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos`\n    )\n    // `todos` has to be declared in data()\n    this.todos = data\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n## Fetch before Nuxt 2.12\n\nIf you have been working with Nuxt for a while, then you‚Äôll know that the previous version of `fetch` was significantly different.\n\n> **Is this a breaking change?**\n> No, it isn't. Actually, the old fetch can still be used by passing the `context` as the first argument to avoid any breaking changes in your existing Nuxt applications.\n\nHere‚Äôs the list of notable changes in `fetch` hook compared with **before** and **after** v2.12.\n\n## 1. Call order of `fetch` hook\n\n**Before -** `fetch` hook was called before initiating the component, hence `this` wasn‚Äôt available inside the fetch hook.\n\n**After -** `fetch` is called after the component instance is created on the server-side when the route is accessed.\n\n## 2. `this` vs `context`\n\n**Before -** We had access to the Nuxt `context` on page-level components, given that the `context` is passed as a first parameter.\n\n```\nexport default {\n  fetch(context) {\n    // ‚Ä¶\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**After -** We can access `this` context just like Vue client-side hooks without passing any parameters.\n\n```\nexport default {\n  fetch() {\n    console.log(this)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## 3. Availability of `fetch` hook\n\n**Before -** Only page (route-level) components were allowed to fetch data on the server-side.\n\n**After -** Now, we can prefetch the data asynchronously in any Vue components.\n\n## 4. Call order of `fetch` hook\n\n**Before -** `fetch` could be called server-side once (on the first request to the Nuxt app) and client-side when navigating to further routes.\n\n**After -** New `fetch` is the same as an old fetch, but‚Ä¶\n‚Ä¶since we can have one `fetch` for each component, `fetch` hooks are called in sequence of their hierarchy.\n\n## 5. Error Handling\n\n**Before -** We used the `context.error` function that showed a custom error page when an error occurred during API calls.\n\n**After -** New `fetch` uses the `$fetchState` object to handle errors in the template area during API calls.\n\nError handling is performed at component level.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nNew fetch hook brings a lot of improvements and provides more flexibility in fetching data and organizing route-level & building-block components in a whole new way!\n\nIt will certainly make you think a little differently when you plan and design your new Nuxt project that requires multiple API calls within the same route.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/understanding-how-fetch-works-in-nuxt-2-12", "title": "Understanding how fetch works in Nuxt 2.12", "description": "Explore different features of the fetch hook and learn a brand new way to bring data into Nuxt applications.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 20, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 01:33:02", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"twitter:image:src": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/understanding-how-fetch-works-in-nuxt-2.12.png", "title": "Understanding how fetch works in Nuxt 2.12 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "ogSiteName": "Nuxt", "twitter:site": "nuxt_js", "favicon": "https://nuxt.com/icon.png", "ogTitle": "Understanding how fetch works in Nuxt 2.12 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "ogDescription": "Explore different features of the fetch hook and learn a brand new way to bring data into Nuxt applications.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og:image:type": "image/png", "og:image:width": "1200", "og:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/understanding-how-fetch-works-in-nuxt-2.12.png", "og:image:height": "600", "language": "en", "ogImage": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/understanding-how-fetch-works-in-nuxt-2.12.png", "description": "Explore different features of the fetch hook and learn a brand new way to bring data into Nuxt applications.", "twitter:image:width": "1200", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "twitter:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/understanding-how-fetch-works-in-nuxt-2.12.png", "og:type": "website", "twitter:image:height": "600", "og:site_name": "Nuxt", "og:description": "Explore different features of the fetch hook and learn a brand new way to bring data into Nuxt applications.", "og:title": "Understanding how fetch works in Nuxt 2.12 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "theme-color": "#020420", "scrapeId": "3a4d0bf1-7aaf-4c4d-9ec8-07a1aa80bfdc", "sourceURL": "https://nuxt.com/blog/understanding-how-fetch-works-in-nuxt-2-12", "url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/understanding-how-fetch-works-in-nuxt-2-12", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful nuxt-blog expert.\n\nUser: How do I error handling in nuxt-blog?\n\nAssistant: To error handling in nuxt-blog, here's what you do:\nNew `fetch` handles error at component level. Let‚Äôs see how.\n\nBecause we‚Äôre fetching data asynchronously, the new fetch() provides a `$fetchState` object to check whether the request has finished and progressed successfully.\n\nBelow is what the `$fetchState` object looks like.\n\n```\n$fetchState = {\n  pending: true | false,\n  error: null | {},\n  timestamp: Integer\n};\n```\n\nWe have three keys,\n\n1. **Pending -** lets you display a placeholder when fetch is being called on client-side\n2. **Error -** lets you show an error message\n3. **Timestamp -** shows timestamp of the last fetch which is useful for caching with `keep-alive`\n\nThese keys are then used directly in the template area of the component to show relevant placeholders during the process of fetching data from the API.\n\n```\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <p v-if=\"$fetchState.pending\">Fetching posts...</p>\n    <p v-else-if=\"$fetchState.error\">Error while fetching posts</p>\n    <ul v-else>\n      ‚Ä¶\n    </ul>\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\nWhen error occurs at **component-level**, we can set HTTP status code on server-side by checking `process.server` in fetch hook and follow it up with `throw new Error()` statement.\n\n```\nasync fetch() {\n  const post = await fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/${this.$route.params.id}`)\n                     .then((res) => res.json())\n\n  if (post.id === this.$route.params.id) {\n      this.post = post\n    } else {\n      // set status code on server and\n      if (process.server) {\n        this.$nuxt.context.res.statusCode = 404\n      }\n      // use throw new Error()\n      throw new Error('Post not found')\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSetting the HTTP status code this way **is useful for correct SEO**..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/understanding-how-fetch-works-in-nuxt-2-12", "title": "Understanding how fetch works in Nuxt 2.12", "description": "Explore different features of the fetch hook and learn a brand new way to bring data into Nuxt applications.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 20, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 01:33:02", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"twitter:image:src": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/understanding-how-fetch-works-in-nuxt-2.12.png", "title": "Understanding how fetch works in Nuxt 2.12 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "ogSiteName": "Nuxt", "twitter:site": "nuxt_js", "favicon": "https://nuxt.com/icon.png", "ogTitle": "Understanding how fetch works in Nuxt 2.12 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "ogDescription": "Explore different features of the fetch hook and learn a brand new way to bring data into Nuxt applications.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og:image:type": "image/png", "og:image:width": "1200", "og:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/understanding-how-fetch-works-in-nuxt-2.12.png", "og:image:height": "600", "language": "en", "ogImage": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/understanding-how-fetch-works-in-nuxt-2.12.png", "description": "Explore different features of the fetch hook and learn a brand new way to bring data into Nuxt applications.", "twitter:image:width": "1200", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "twitter:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/understanding-how-fetch-works-in-nuxt-2.12.png", "og:type": "website", "twitter:image:height": "600", "og:site_name": "Nuxt", "og:description": "Explore different features of the fetch hook and learn a brand new way to bring data into Nuxt applications.", "og:title": "Understanding how fetch works in Nuxt 2.12 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "theme-color": "#020420", "scrapeId": "3a4d0bf1-7aaf-4c4d-9ec8-07a1aa80bfdc", "sourceURL": "https://nuxt.com/blog/understanding-how-fetch-works-in-nuxt-2-12", "url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/understanding-how-fetch-works-in-nuxt-2-12", "statusCode": 200}}}

And also allows **adding a number of seconds** before we can re-fetch the data.\n\nFor any of the above methods to work, we have to use the `keep-alive` prop in generic `<nuxt />` and `<nuxt-child` \u001e components.\n\nlayouts/default.vue\n\n```\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <nuxt keep-alive />\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\nIn addition, we can pass `:keep-alive-props` to `<nuxt />` component to cache a number of pages along with their fetched data.\n\n`:keep-alive-props` prop allow us to indicate the maximum number of pages that should be kept in the memory while we navigate elsewhere within the site.\n\nlayouts/default.vue\n\n```\n<nuxt keep-alive :keep-alive-props=\"{ max: 10 }\" />\n```\n\nAbove is one way to boost page performance which is more high-level and generic, while the next one drills down to optimize the fetch request calls by using the `timestamp` property of `$fetchState` and comparing it against the number of seconds delay before it re-fetches the data.\n\nVue‚Äôs `activated` hook is used here with Nuxt's `keep-alive` prop to re-fetch the data.\n\n```\nexport default {\n  activated() {\n    // Call fetch again if last fetch more than a minute ago\n    if (this.$fetchState.timestamp <= Date.now() - 60000) {\n      this.$fetch()\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n.\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/understanding-how-fetch-works-in-nuxt-2-12", "title": "Understanding how fetch works in Nuxt 2.12", "description": "Explore different features of the fetch hook and learn a brand new way to bring data into Nuxt applications.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 20, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 01:33:02", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"twitter:image:src": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/understanding-how-fetch-works-in-nuxt-2.12.png", "title": "Understanding how fetch works in Nuxt 2.12 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "ogSiteName": "Nuxt", "twitter:site": "nuxt_js", "favicon": "https://nuxt.com/icon.png", "ogTitle": "Understanding how fetch works in Nuxt 2.12 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "ogDescription": "Explore different features of the fetch hook and learn a brand new way to bring data into Nuxt applications.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og:image:type": "image/png", "og:image:width": "1200", "og:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/understanding-how-fetch-works-in-nuxt-2.12.png", "og:image:height": "600", "language": "en", "ogImage": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/understanding-how-fetch-works-in-nuxt-2.12.png", "description": "Explore different features of the fetch hook and learn a brand new way to bring data into Nuxt applications.", "twitter:image:width": "1200", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "twitter:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/understanding-how-fetch-works-in-nuxt-2.12.png", "og:type": "website", "twitter:image:height": "600", "og:site_name": "Nuxt", "og:description": "Explore different features of the fetch hook and learn a brand new way to bring data into Nuxt applications.", "og:title": "Understanding how fetch works in Nuxt 2.12 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "theme-color": "#020420", "scrapeId": "3a4d0bf1-7aaf-4c4d-9ec8-07a1aa80bfdc", "sourceURL": "https://nuxt.com/blog/understanding-how-fetch-works-in-nuxt-2-12", "url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/understanding-how-fetch-works-in-nuxt-2-12", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful nuxt-blog expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Nuxt 3.11 is in nuxt-blog?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Nuxt 3.11 in nuxt-blog.\n\n# Nuxt 3.11\n\nNuxt 3.11 is out - with better logging, preview mode, server pages and much more!Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## ü™µ Better logging\n\nWhen developing a Nuxt application and using `console.log` in your application, you may have noticed that these logs are not displayed in your browser console when refreshing the page (during server-side rendering). This can be frustrating, as it makes it difficult to debug your application. This is now a thing of the past!\n\nNow, when you have server logs associated with a request, they will be bundled up and passed to the client and displayed in your browser console. [Asynchronous context](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v20.x/api/async_context.html) is used to track and associate these logs with the request that triggered them. ( [#25936](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/25936)).\n\nFor example, this code:\n\npages/index.vue\n\n```\n<script setup>\nconsole.log('Log from index page')\n\nconst { data } = await useAsyncData(() => {\n  console.log('Log inside useAsyncData')\n  return $fetch('/api/test')\n})\n</script>\n```\n\nwill now log to your browser console when you refresh the page:\n\n```\nLog from index page\n[ssr] Log inside useAsyncData\n    at pages/index.vue\n```\n\nüëâ We also plan to support streaming of subsequent logs to the Nuxt DevTools in future.\n\nWe've also added a `dev:ssr-logs` hook (both in Nuxt and Nitro) which is called on server and client, allowing you to handle them yourself if you want to.\n\nIf you encounter any issues with this, it is possible to disable them - or prevent them from logging to your browser console.\n\nnuxt.config.ts\n\n```\nexport default defineNuxtConfig({\n  features: {\n    devLogs: false\n    // or 'silent' to allow you to handle yourself with `dev:ssr-logs` hook\n  },\n})\n```\n\n## üé® Preview mode\n\nA new `usePreviewMode` composable aims to make it simple to use preview mode in your Nuxt app.\n\nplugins/test.client.ts\n\n```\nconst { enabled, state } = usePreviewMode()\n```\n\nWhen preview mode is enabled, all your data fetching composables, like `useAsyncData` and `useFetch` will rerun, meaning any cached data in the payload will be bypassed.\n\nRead more in Docs > API > Composables > Use Preview Mode.\n\n## üí∞ Cache-busting payloads\n\nWe now automatically cache-bust your payloads if you haven't disabled Nuxt's app manifest, meaning you shouldn't be stuck with outdated data after a deployment ( [#26068](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/26068)).\n\n## üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Middleware `routeRules`\n\nIt's now possible to define middleware for page paths within the Vue app part of your application (that is, not your Nitro routes) ( [#25841](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/25841)).\n\nnuxt.config.ts\n\n```\nexport default defineNuxtConfig({\n  routeRules: {\n    '/admin/**': {\n      // or appMiddleware: 'auth'\n      appMiddleware: ['auth']\n    },\n    '/admin/login': {\n      // You can 'turn off' middleware that would otherwise run for a page\n      appMiddleware: {\n        auth: false\n      }\n    },\n  },\n})\n```\n\n## ‚å´ New `clear` data fetching utility\n\nNow, `useAsyncData` and `useFetch` expose a `clear` utility. This is a function that can be used to set `data` to undefined, set `error` to `null`, set `pending` to `false`, set `status` to `idle`, and mark any currently pending requests as cancelled. ( [#26259](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/26259))\n\n```\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nconst { data, clear } = await useFetch('/api/test')\n\nconst route = useRoute()\nwatch(() => route.path, (path) => {\n  if (path === '/') clear()\n})\n</script>\n```\n\n## üï≥Ô∏è New `#teleports` target\n\nNuxt now includes a new `<div id=\"teleports\"></div>` element in your app within your `<body>` tag. It supports server-side teleports, meaning you can do this safely on the server:\n\napp.vue\n\n```\n<template>\n  <Teleport to=\"#teleports\">\n    <span>\n      Something\n    </span>\n  </Teleport>\n</template>\n```\n\n## üö¶ Loading indicator and transition controls\n\nIt's now possible to set custom timings for hiding the loading indicator, and forcing the `finish()` method if needed ( [#25932](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/25932)).\n\nThere's also a new `page:view-transition:start` hook for hooking into the View Transitions API ( [#26045](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/26045)) if you have that feature enabled.\n\n## üõçÔ∏è Server- and client-only pages\n\nThis release sees server- and client-only pages land in Nuxt! You can now add a `.server.vue` or `.client.vue` suffix to a page to get automatic handling of it.\n\n**Client-only pages** will render entirely on the client-side, and skip server-rendering entirely, just as if the entire page was wrapped in `<ClientOnly>`. Use this responsibly. The flash of load on the client-side can be a bad user experience so make sure you really need to avoid server-side loading. Also consider using `<ClientOnly>` with a `fallback` slot to render a skeleton loader ( [#25037](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/25037)).\n\n‚öóÔ∏è **Server-only pages** are even more useful because they enable you to integrate fully-server rendered HTML within client-side navigation. They will even be prefetched when links to them are in the viewport - so you will get instantaneous loading ( [#24954](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/24954)).\n\n## ü§† Server component bonanza\n\nWhen you are using server components, you can now use the `nuxt-client` attribute anywhere within your tree ( [#25479](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/25479)).\n\nnuxt.config.ts\n\n```\nexport default defineNuxtConfig({\n  experimental: {\n    componentIslands: {\n      selectiveClient: 'deep'\n    }\n  },\n})\n```\n\nYou can listen to an `@error` event from server components that will be triggered if there is any issue loading the component ( [#25798](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/25798)).\n\nFinally, server-only components are now smartly enabled when you have a server-only component or a server-only page within your project or any of its layers ( [#26223](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/26223)).\n\nServer components remain experimental and their API may change, so be careful before depending on implementation details.\n\n## üî• Performance improvements\n\nWe've shipped a number of performance improvements, including only updating changed virtual templates ( [#26250](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/26250)), using a 'layered' prerender cache ( [#26104](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/26104)) that falls back to filesystem instead of keeping everything in memory when prerendering - and lots of other examples.\n\n## üìÇ Public assets handling\n\nWe have shipped a reimplementation of Vite's public asset handling, meaning that public assets in your `public/` directory or your layer directories are now resolved entirely by Nuxt ( [#26163](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/26163)), so if you have added `nitro.publicAssets` directories with a custom prefix, these will now work.\n\n## üì¶ Chunk naming\n\nWe have changed the default `_nuxt/[name].[hash].js` file name pattern for your JS chunks. Now, we default to `_nuxt/[hash].js`. This is to avoid false positives by ad blockers triggering off your component or chunk names, which can be a very difficult issue to debug. ( [#26203](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/26203))\n\nYou can easily configure this to revert to previous behaviour if you wish:\n\nnuxt.config.ts\n\n```\nexport default defineNuxtConfig({\n  vite: {\n    $client: {\n      build: {\n        rollupOptions: {\n          output: {\n            chunkFileNames: '_nuxt/[name].[hash].js',\n            entryFileNames: '_nuxt/[name].[hash].js'\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  },\n})\n```\n\n## üí™ Type fixes\n\nPreviously users with `shamefully-hoist=false` may have encountered issues with types not being resolved or working correctly. You may also have encountered problems with excessive type instantiation.\n\nWe now try to tell TypeScript about certain key types so they can be resolved even if deeply nested ( [#26158](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/26158)).\n\nThere are a whole raft of other type fixes, including some regarding import types ( [#26218](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/26218) and [#25965](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/25965)) and module typings ( [#25548](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/25548)).\n\n## ‚úÖ Upgrading\n\nAs usual, our recommendation for upgrading Nuxt is to run:\n\n```\nnuxi upgrade --force\n```\n\nThis will refresh your lockfile as well, and ensures that you pull in updates from other dependencies that Nuxt relies on, particularly in the unjs ecosystem.\n\n## üëâ Full release notes\n\nRead the full release notes of Nuxt `v3.11.0`.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-11", "title": "Nuxt 3.11", "description": "Nuxt 3.11 is out - with better logging, preview mode, server pages and much more!", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 15, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 01:33:50", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:image:width": "1200", "favicon": "https://nuxt.com/icon.png", "twitter:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3.11.png", "description": "Nuxt 3.11 is out - with better logging, preview mode, server pages and much more!", "og:image:height": "600", "og:site_name": "Nuxt", "twitter:image:height": "600", "og:title": "Nuxt 3.11 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "og:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3.11.png", "twitter:image:width": "1200", "og:description": "Nuxt 3.11 is out - with better logging, preview mode, server pages and much more!", "theme-color": "#020420", "title": "Nuxt 3.11 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "twitter:site": "nuxt_js", "ogTitle": "Nuxt 3.11 ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "ogSiteName": "Nuxt", "language": "en", "og:image:type": "image/png", "twitter:image:src": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3.11.png", "og:type": "website", "ogDescription": "Nuxt 3.11 is out - with better logging, preview mode, server pages and much more!", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ogImage": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/v3.11.png", "scrapeId": "12c62fd7-8a6c-4941-9032-8e039204182b", "sourceURL": "https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-11", "url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-11", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful nuxt-blog expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Nuxt: Looking forward is in nuxt-blog?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Nuxt: Looking forward in nuxt-blog.\n\n# Nuxt: Looking forward\n\nA look back at the achievements of Nuxt in 2023 and the plans for 2024, including new features, community growth, and future releases.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## A Review of 2023 - S√©bastien\n\nIn January 2023, Daniel set out [**Nuxt: A vision for 2023**](https://nuxt.com/blog/vision-2023). We achieved most of the goals we set out to accomplish. Some of them are missing and we will tackle them this year!\n\nIt was a productive year and the team shipped **9 minor releases**: from v3.1 to v3.9.\n\nIn the first 365 days, Nuxt 3 reached new milestones:\n\n- **49,5K stars** on GitHub ( [add yours](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt) üòä)\n- **27M downloads** on npm\n- **612 contributors** on the [nuxt repository](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt)\n- **184 modules** created by **142 maintainers**\n- **2,423 closed issues**\n- **1,728 merged pull request**\n- **26,300 members** on [Discord](https://chat.nuxt.dev/)\n\nEnd of October, Nuxt 3 downloads [surpassed Nuxt 2 downloads](https://twitter.com/Atinux/status/1731980841142669379) üöÄ.\n\nThe same month, we released [Nuxt Image 1.0](https://image.nuxt.com/) with Nuxt 3 support and new features to make sure your website stays performant when using Images. Nuxt now auto-installs it as soon as you start using the [`<NuxtImg>`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/components/nuxt-img) or [`<NuxtPicture>`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/components/nuxt-picture) component.\n\nWe shipped [Nuxt DevTools](https://nuxt.com/blog/nuxt-devtools-v1-0), leveling up the Developer Experience we can expect from a Web framework. I am happy to see that we inspired other frameworks to adopt a similar approach: [Vue DevTools](https://twitter.com/vuejs/status/1741032977919053865), [Next DevTools](https://twitter.com/xinyao27/status/1741447261132145133), [Remix DevTools](https://twitter.com/AlemTuzlak59192/status/1741903214860009539), [Vite Plugin DevTools](https://github.com/pheno-agency/vite-plugin-devtools), [Astro Dev Toolbar](https://twitter.com/n_moore/status/1732164645778071888) and more.\n\nAfter many months of building our UI library internally, [Benjamin Canac](https://github.com/benjamincanac) open sourced [Nuxt UI](https://ui.nuxt.com/) to let you create websites at a faster pace with highly customizable components built with TailwindCSS.\n\n[Nuxt Content](http://content.nuxt.com/) has had 10 minor releases with various improvements: from performance to the MDC syntax. We have some ongoing work to better support [edge rendering](https://nuxt.com/blog/nuxt-on-the-edge) in the future. At the same time, the NuxtLabs team is working on [Nuxt Studio](https://nuxt.studio/) to let users edit Markdown files with a Notion-like editor while keeping your content inside your git repository.\n\n## Looking forward into 2024 - Daniel\n\nWe are well into 2024, and this update is definitely overdue!\n\nHere are a few thoughts on the direction that I'll be seeking to lead Nuxt in over the next year.\n\n### Continued development and reimagination\n\nI would love to see us continuing to adapt our best practices to the changing needs of the ecosystem, expand the boundaries of what good DX could be, and improve Nuxt.\n\nI am really pleased at what we currently offer in Nuxt. But I would never want to rest on our laurels. We need to keep pursuing new possibilities that appear as the web platform develops. We've committed to [Baseline Compatibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Baseline/Compatibility) going forward (and are included in conversations about it with the [W3C WebDX Community Group](https://github.com/web-platform-dx/web-features)).\n\nWe have some strategies to enable us to do this while also prioritising stability for our existing users, and recognising the scope of the Nuxt ecosystem.\n\n1. In general we follow a pattern of **introducing a module or experimental feature** that can be disabled in testing while we gather feedback and confirm the direction and API of new features.\n2. We have adopted the **ecosystem-ci pattern** of validating that our code changes in Nuxt don't break downstream projects unintentionally. If you maintain a well-tested module or library that depends on Nuxt, I'd welcome a PR adding your project to [nuxt/ecosystem-ci](https://github.com/nuxt/ecosystem-ci).\n3. We plan to release a **pull-based test** that will allow you to configure your CI to test itself against the latest nightly version of Nuxt to provide early feedback on new Nuxt releases, rather than facing an issue when upgrading.\n4. Finally, we have adopted a **push-based approach to updating existing projects**. When we identify breaking changes or improvements that can be rolled out to the ecosystem, we will proactively raise PRs to Nuxt modules (and, to a lesser extent, other open-source projects using Nuxt).\n\nI hope this will allow us to continue to innovate and experiment with new features without sacrificing the stability and maintainability.\n\nIn particular, look for active development on the following:\n\n- ‚úÖ [nuxt/fonts](https://github.com/nuxt/fonts) \\- working up to v1.0.0\n- ‚úÖ [nuxt/eslint](https://github.com/nuxt/eslint) \\- working up to v1.0.0\n- üî• [nuxt/scripts](https://github.com/nuxt/scripts) \\- soon to be released\n- üöß [nuxt/a11y](https://github.com/nuxt/a11y) \\- coming soon!\n- üöß [nuxt/auth](https://github.com/nuxt/auth) \\- coming soon!\n- üöß [nuxt/hints](https://github.com/nuxt/hints) \\- coming soon!\n\n## Sustainable open source\n\nI want Nuxt to continue to be an independent, community-driven framework for the long term.\n\nI'm really delighted to see successful businesses founded on Nuxt, and initiatives springing up around Nuxt that become [sponsors](https://nuxt.com/enterprise/sponsors) or otherwise giving back to the core framework, enabling ongoing Nuxt development.\n\nObviously, [NuxtLabs](https://nuxtlabs.com/) is the preeminent example of that. [Pooya Parsa](https://github.com/pi0), [Anthony Fu](https://github.com/antfu) and I are all able to work full-time on open source thanks to their paid services around Nuxt: [Nuxt UI Pro](https://ui.nuxt.com/pro/getting-started), [Nuxt Experts](https://nuxt.com/enterprise/support), [Nuxt Studio](https://nuxt.studio/) and [NuxtHub](https://hub.nuxt.com/) (soon). They also [sponsor community members](https://github.com/orgs/nuxtlabs/sponsoring) from Vue, Vite, UnJS, and Nuxt.\n\nFor me, keeping Nuxt independent and sustainable for the future requires an active and growing team and community. In the weeks ahead, I'll be announcing a broader 'Nuxt team' alongside the core team. This is about recognising the tireless work of the many people whose contributions are already making Nuxt what it is.\n\nI would also love to see more of those team members or the wider community sponsored to work in the Nuxt ecosystem in the years ahead. If your company has benefited from Nuxt, please do consider sponsoring some of the developers working on Nuxt, whether they are team or wider community members.\n\n## Friendly collaboration\n\nFrom the beginning of our work on Nuxt 3, we have sought to extract out utilities, libraries and even frameworks that we benefit from so they can _also_ benefit a much broader audience.\n\nThat's the origin of [UnJS](https://unjs.io/), of course, and it continues to thrive under the leadership of [Pooya Parsa](https://github.com/pi0) (who is also a key member of the Nuxt core team).\n\nWe'd like to continue that attitude of friendly collaboration. Although building things ourselves or keeping them to ourselves might to be 'success', I don't have any time for zero-sum games. We will go further, both as a framework and as a web community, if we build _together_.\n\nEqually, one of our core values is platform-independence (alongside deep platform _integration_). We support 90+ providers across deployment, testing, stories, KV and cache, databases, image CDNs and font hosts. That breadth of ecosystem is one that bears rich rewards and frees people up to make choices about which providers they use based on the value they bring. But it _also_ means we are dependent on our community who use these different providers to help us keep these integrations up-to-date.\n\n## A welcoming community\n\nAlthough it is easy to focus on technical excellence or the quality of developer experience, I am more encouraged to see the continued growth of the Nuxt ecosystem as a welcoming and friendly community.\n\nI am incredibly grateful for the kind tone that prevails across [our community Discord](https://chat.nuxt.dev/), on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nuxt_js), and on [GitHub](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt).\n\n## What about Nuxt 4?\n\nThe JavaScript space is known for producing a new framework every week, which means there is a natural hype cycle.\n\nBut we are not aiming for hype with the continued development of Nuxt, which is part of why we have committed to regular release cycles:\n\n- **major** framework releases every year\n- **minor** releases every month or so\n- **patch** releases every week or so\n\nYou can expect to see breaking changes shipped in major releases, with features shipped in our minor releases. That means we aren't holding features back for Nuxt 4; we'll ship those as regularly as we can in our 6-weekly minor release cycle.\n\nOur aim is that Nuxt 4 is an opportunity for _thoughtful_ breaking changes with either a straightforward migration path (ideally with automated processes) or the ability to opt-in to previous behaviour.\n\nThere are definitely lessons we as a team have learned form the transition from Nuxt 2 to 3, and I see Nuxt 4 as an opportunity for us to prove that major releases can be a good experience for users.\n\nYou can preview the changes we have in mind by browsing [our roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/nuxt/projects/8/views/4) or checking through [the issues we've tagged for v4](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/issues?q=is:issue+label:4.x). Feedback and wishes are very welcome as always!\n\n## Timetable\n\nOur roadmap for Nuxt 4 is a little complex as we are also planning on major releases across the UnJS ecosystem.\n\nRoughly speaking, we are aiming to have one more minor release for Nuxt v3 and Nitro v2, before beginning a [raft of major releases across the UnJS ecosystem of packages](https://github.com/unjs/community/discussions/4) \\- culminating in Nuxt v4.\n\nWe are aiming to release **Nuxt v4 on or before June 14** (though obviously this is dependent on having enough time after Nitro's major release to be properly tested in the community, so be aware that this is not an exact date).\n\n## Ongoing Support\n\nAfter the release of Nuxt v4, we will be providing **six months** of ongoing support and bug-fixes for Nuxt v3, which we expect will be more than ample to upgrade to v4 given our aim of a gentle upgrade path.\n\nWe hope you are as excited as we are about the pending release of Nuxt v4! üéâ\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/looking-forward-2024", "title": "Nuxt: Looking forward", "description": "A look back at the achievements of Nuxt in 2023 and the plans for 2024, including new features, community growth, and future releases.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 8, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 01:36:48", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:image:width": "1200", "twitter:image:height": "600", "og:site_name": "Nuxt", "favicon": "https://nuxt.com/icon.png", "og:type": "website", "language": "en", "title": "Nuxt: Looking forward ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "ogTitle": "Nuxt: Looking forward ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "twitter:image:src": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/vision-for-2024.png", "twitter:site": "nuxt_js", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og:description": "A lot of things have happened for Nuxt over the last year.

We have adopted the **ecosystem-ci pattern** of validating that our code changes in Nuxt don't break downstream projects unintentionally. If you maintain a well-tested module or library that depends on Nuxt, I'd welcome a PR adding your project to [nuxt/ecosystem-ci](https://github.com/nuxt/ecosystem-ci).\n3. We plan to release a **pull-based test** that will allow you to configure your CI to test itself against the latest nightly version of Nuxt to provide early feedback on new Nuxt releases, rather than facing an issue when upgrading.\n4. Finally, we have adopted a **push-based approach to updating existing projects**. When we identify breaking changes or improvements that can be rolled out to the ecosystem, we will proactively raise PRs to Nuxt modules (and, to a lesser extent, other open-source projects using Nuxt).\n\nI hope this will allow us to continue to innovate and experiment with new features without sacrificing the stability and maintainability.\n\nIn particular, look for active development on the following:\n\n- ‚úÖ [nuxt/fonts](https://github.com/nuxt/fonts) \\- working up to v1.0.0\n- ‚úÖ [nuxt/eslint](https://github.com/nuxt/eslint) \\- working up to v1.0.0\n- üî• [nuxt/scripts](https://github.com/nuxt/scripts) \\- soon to be released\n- üöß [nuxt/a11y](https://github.com/nuxt/a11y) \\- coming soon!\n- üöß [nuxt/auth](https://github.com/nuxt/auth) \\- coming soon!\n- üöß [nuxt/hints](https://github.com/nuxt/hints) \\- coming soon!.\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/looking-forward-2024", "title": "Nuxt: Looking forward", "description": "A look back at the achievements of Nuxt in 2023 and the plans for 2024, including new features, community growth, and future releases.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 8, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 01:36:48", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:image:width": "1200", "twitter:image:height": "600", "og:site_name": "Nuxt", "favicon": "https://nuxt.com/icon.png", "og:type": "website", "language": "en", "title": "Nuxt: Looking forward ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "ogTitle": "Nuxt: Looking forward ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "twitter:image:src": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/vision-for-2024.png", "twitter:site": "nuxt_js", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og:description": "A lot of things have happened for Nuxt over the last year.

[Pooya Parsa](https://github.com/pi0), [Anthony Fu](https://github.com/antfu) and I are all able to work full-time on open source thanks to their paid services around Nuxt: [Nuxt UI Pro](https://ui.nuxt.com/pro/getting-started), [Nuxt Experts](https://nuxt.com/enterprise/support), [Nuxt Studio](https://nuxt.studio/) and [NuxtHub](https://hub.nuxt.com/) (soon). They also [sponsor community members](https://github.com/orgs/nuxtlabs/sponsoring) from Vue, Vite, UnJS, and Nuxt.\n\nFor me, keeping Nuxt independent and sustainable for the future requires an active and growing team and community. In the weeks ahead, I'll be announcing a broader 'Nuxt team' alongside the core team. This is about recognising the tireless work of the many people whose contributions are already making Nuxt what it is.\n\nI would also love to see more of those team members or the wider community sponsored to work in the Nuxt ecosystem in the years ahead. If your company has benefited from Nuxt, please do consider sponsoring some of the developers working on Nuxt, whether they are team or wider community members..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/looking-forward-2024", "title": "Nuxt: Looking forward", "description": "A look back at the achievements of Nuxt in 2023 and the plans for 2024, including new features, community growth, and future releases.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 8, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 01:36:48", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:image:width": "1200", "twitter:image:height": "600", "og:site_name": "Nuxt", "favicon": "https://nuxt.com/icon.png", "og:type": "website", "language": "en", "title": "Nuxt: Looking forward ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "ogTitle": "Nuxt: Looking forward ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "twitter:image:src": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/vision-for-2024.png", "twitter:site": "nuxt_js", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og:description": "A lot of things have happened for Nuxt over the last year.

Although building things ourselves or keeping them to ourselves might to be 'success', I don't have any time for zero-sum games. We will go further, both as a framework and as a web community, if we build _together_.\n\nEqually, one of our core values is platform-independence (alongside deep platform _integration_). We support 90+ providers across deployment, testing, stories, KV and cache, databases, image CDNs and font hosts. That breadth of ecosystem is one that bears rich rewards and frees people up to make choices about which providers they use based on the value they bring. But it _also_ means we are dependent on our community who use these different providers to help us keep these integrations up-to-date..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/looking-forward-2024", "title": "Nuxt: Looking forward", "description": "A look back at the achievements of Nuxt in 2023 and the plans for 2024, including new features, community growth, and future releases.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 8, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 01:36:48", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:image:width": "1200", "twitter:image:height": "600", "og:site_name": "Nuxt", "favicon": "https://nuxt.com/icon.png", "og:type": "website", "language": "en", "title": "Nuxt: Looking forward ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "ogTitle": "Nuxt: Looking forward ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "twitter:image:src": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/vision-for-2024.png", "twitter:site": "nuxt_js", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og:description": "A lot of things have happened for Nuxt over the last year.

That means we aren't holding features back for Nuxt 4; we'll ship those as regularly as we can in our 6-weekly minor release cycle.\n\nOur aim is that Nuxt 4 is an opportunity for _thoughtful_ breaking changes with either a straightforward migration path (ideally with automated processes) or the ability to opt-in to previous behaviour.\n\nThere are definitely lessons we as a team have learned form the transition from Nuxt 2 to 3, and I see Nuxt 4 as an opportunity for us to prove that major releases can be a good experience for users.\n\nYou can preview the changes we have in mind by browsing [our roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/nuxt/projects/8/views/4) or checking through [the issues we've tagged for v4](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/issues?q=is:issue+label:4.x).

Along the way, Nuxt introduced many innovative features and conventions to make your day-to-day development easier and more efficient.\n\nIn Nuxt 3, we switched to Vite as the default bundler for the instant hot module replacement (HMR) during developement, creating a faster feedback loop to your workflow. Additionally, we have introduced Nitro, a new server engine that allows you to deploy your Nuxt app to any hosting service, such as Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare and more with zero-config.\n\nNuxt offers many common practices built-in:\n\n- Write TypeScript and ESM out-of-the-box throughout your codebase.\n- Build single-page applications (SPA), server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), or hybrid them per routes - using the same codebase isomorphically without any explicit setup.\n- Use several composables, like useState and useAsyncData for sharing states accessible across the server and client sides.\n- Leverage SEO utilities, like useHead and useSeoMeta to make meta-tags management a breaze.\n\nMoreover, features such as the layout system, plugins, route middleware, and other tools make app creation easier and codebases more organized.\n\nConventions like file-based routing and file-based server APIs making the routing intuitive and effortless.\n\nComponents auto-imports makes it easy to create shared components that are directly available in any Vue file. Unlike global components, they are code-splitted. We also introduced composables auto-import, where all APIs from Vue are directly available. Nuxt modules can also provide their custom composables to be auto-imported, as well as your local composables.\n\nRecently, we introduced client and server-only components, which can be used by adding .client and .server to the filename. All these conventions are fully typed and developers can even have type autocomplete when doing route navigation or fetching data from APIs. These conventions significantly reduce boilerplate code, avoid duplications, and improve productivity.\n\nWhen it comes to ecosystem, Nuxt has a large community of developers building modules around it, with hundreds of high-quality modules available. Modules allow developers to get integrations for features they want without worrying about configuration or best practices.\n\n## The Problem\n\nNuxt is capable of creating a large scale application at ease, however there is one problem: the lack of transparency.\n\nFor every new feature and convention we introduce, we are adding a bit more abstraction to the framework.\n\nAbstractions are great things to transfer implementation complexity and make things easier to get more focus when building. On the other hand, they can also add extra burden for users to learn and understand what's going on under the hood. Leading also to implicitness, like where a auto-imported component is from, or how many modules is using a certain component, etc. It can also make things hard to debug.\n\nThis might be considered as a trade-off of any tools, you have to learn and understand the tool to use it with efficiency. Despite improving the documentation and providing more examples, we believe of an opportunity to improve the lack of transparency.\n\n## Introducing Nuxt DevTools\n\nNuxt DevTools is a visual tool to help you understand your Nuxt app and improve the developer experience even further. It's created to provide a better transparency of Nuxt and your app, find performance bottlenecks and help you manage your app and configuration.\n\nIt is shipped as an experimental module and provide the views right inside your app. Once installed, it will add a small icon on the bottom of your app. Clicking it will open the DevTools panel.\n\nTo try it, please refer to the installation guide.\n\n## Overview\n\nShows a quick overview of your app, including the Nuxt version, pages, components, modules, and plugins you are using. It also check your Nuxt version and allow you to upgrade with a single click.\n\n## Pages\n\nThe pages tab shows your current routes and provide a quick way to navigate to them. For dynamic routes, it also provide a form to fill with each params interactively. You can also use the textbox to play and test how each route is matched.\n\n## Components\n\nComponents tab show all the components you are using in your app and where they are from. You can also search for them and go to the source code.\n\nIt also provides a graph view that show the relationship between components. You can filter the components to see the dependencies of a specific component. This could help to identify unintended dependencies and improve the performance and bundle size of pages.\n\nYou can also use the \"Inspector\" feature to inspect the DOM tree and see which component is rendering it. Click to go to your editor of the specific line. Making it much easier to make changes, without the requirement of understanding the project structure thoroughly.\n\n## Imports\n\nImports tab shows all the auto-imports registered to Nuxt. You can see which files are importing them, and where they are from. Some entries can also provide short descriptions and documentation links.\n\n## Modules\n\nModules tab shows all the modules you have installed and providing the links to their documentation and source code. You can find more modules available in Nuxt Modules.\n\n## Assets\n\nThe assets tab that shows all your static assets and their information. You can copy the paths of the assets, or the code snippets of using them. In the future, with the integrations of Nuxt Image, you can even optimize images with a single click.\n\n## Plugins\n\nPlugins tab shows all the plugins you are using in your app. As plugins runs before the app is mounted,the time spent in each plugin should be minimal to avoid blocking the app from rendering. The time cost of each plugin provided can be helpful to find performance bottlenecks.\n\n## Hooks\n\nHooks tab can help you to monitor the time spent in each hook from both client and server side. You can also see how many listeners registered to each hook, and how many times they have been invoked. This can be helpful to find performance bottlenecks.\n\n## App Config\n\nYou can inspect and modify the app config in DevTools, try different configurations and see the effects immediately.\n\n## Payload & Data\n\nThis tab shows the state created by useState, useAsyncData and useFetch. It can be helpful to understand how the data is fetched and how the state is managed, or change them reactively to see it they affects your app. For useAsyncData and useFetch, you can also manually the trigger the refetch.\n\n## Terminals\n\nIn some integrations, they might require to have subprocesses running to do certain jobs. Before DevTools, you either hide the output of the subprocess entirely and swallow the potential warnings/errors, or pipe to stdout and pollute your terminal with multiple outputs. Now you can now have the outputs in DevTools for each process and clearly isolated.\n\n## Virtual Files\n\nVirtual Files tab shows the virtual files generated by Nuxt and Nitro to support the conventions. This can be helpful for advanced debugging.\n\n## Inspect\n\nInspect expose the vite-plugin-inspect integration, allowing you to inspect transformation steps of Vite. It can be helpful to understand how each plugin is transforming your code and spot potential issues.\n\n## VS Code\n\nThanks to VS Code Server, we are able to integrate a full-featured VS Code instance into DevTools. You can install extensions and sync your settings. This allows you to get closer feedback loop where you can change the code and see the result immediately without leaving the browser.\n\n## Module Contributed View\n\nWith the ecosystem in mind, Nuxt DevTools to designed to be flexible and extendable. Modules could contribute their own views to DevTools, to provide interactive data and playgrounds for their integrations.\n\n## For Module Authors\n\nWith the release of v0.3.0, we improved the ability for module authors to contribute to the DevTools.\n\n## What to Expect Next?\n\nThis is just the beginning of the journey. We are planning to add more features to DevTools, while exploring the ways to present the data in more intuitive and playful ways.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/introducing-nuxt-devtools", "title": "Introducing Nuxt DevTools", "description": "Unleash the Developer Experience with Nuxt and understand your app better than ever.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 20, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 01:37:30", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"twitter:image:height": "600", "language": "en", "og:type": "website", "title": "Introducing Nuxt DevTools ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "og:title": "Introducing Nuxt DevTools ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "og:site_name": "Nuxt", "favicon": "https://nuxt.com/icon.png", "og:image:width": "1200", "ogImage": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/nuxt-devtools.png", "ogDescription": "Unleash the Developer Experience with Nuxt and understand your app better than ever.", "og:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/nuxt-devtools.png", "ogTitle": "Introducing Nuxt DevTools ¬∑ Nuxt Blog", "og:image:type": "image/png", "ogSiteName": "Nuxt", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "twitter:image:src": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/nuxt-devtools.png", "twitter:image:width": "1200", "og:image:height": "600", "theme-color": "#020420", "twitter:image": "https://nuxt.com/assets/blog/nuxt-devtools.png", "twitter:site": "nuxt_js", "description": "Unleash the Developer Experience with Nuxt and understand your app better than ever.", "og:description": "Unleash the Developer Experience with Nuxt and understand your app better than ever.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "scrapeId": "7af39781-fb0e-4957-8c1d-13d721216779", "sourceURL": "https://nuxt.com/blog/introducing-nuxt-devtools", "url": "https://nuxt.com/blog/introducing-nuxt-devtools", "statusCode": 200}}}
