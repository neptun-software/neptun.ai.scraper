{"text": "System: You are a helpful Coolify expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Downgrading Coolify\"?\n\nAssistant: Instructions for downgrading your self-hosted instance of Coolify.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Downgrading Coolify\nIf you're using Coolify Cloud, please note that you **cannot** downgrade the version of Coolify, as the cloud instances are managed by the Core Team. If you are facing any issues, please contact support.\n\nThe following instructions are for those who are self-hosting Coolify and wish to downgrade their instance.\n\nIf you're experiencing issues with the latest version of Coolify, you can easily downgrade to the previous version. Follow the steps below to perform a downgrade on your self-hosted instance.\n\nCAUTION!!\n\n**Downgrading can introduce issues, so it is recommended to test the downgrade process in a staging environment before applying it to your production server.**\n\nThe Downgrade process involves the following three steps:\n\n- Disable Auto Update\n- Login to the Server via SSH\n- Execute the Downgrade Command\n\n## 1. Disable Auto Update\nBefore downgrading, it's important to disable the Auto Update feature to prevent Coolify from automatically upgrading again after you perform the downgrade.\n\n1. Log in as the root user (or any user who has access to the root or initial team).\n2. Navigate to the Settings menu in your Coolify dashboard.\n3. In the Settings menu, disable the **Auto Update** feature.\n\nImportant!\n\nDisabling auto-update is essential, as it ensures that Coolify doesn’t override your downgrade with a newer version.\n\n## 2. Login to Your Server via SSH\nNext, you need to SSH into your server to execute the downgrade command.\n\n## 3. Execute the Downgrade Command\nTo downgrade Coolify to the desired version, run the following command in your terminal:\n\n```sh\ncurl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh | sudo bash -s 4.0.0-beta.369\n```\n\nReplace `4.0.0-beta.369` with the version number you want to downgrade to.\n\nFor example, you can downgrade to `4.0.0-beta.333` or any previous version.\n\nDouble-check the version number you are specifying to ensure you are downgrading to the correct version. You can check the Coolify release notes for version details.\n\n## Potential Issues with Downgrading\nWhile downgrading is possible, be aware of the following risks:\n\n- Database Schema Compatibility\n- Feature Incompatibility\n\n## Database Schema Compatibility\nDowngrading can cause issues since the database schema may not be backward compatible. Some features may not work as expected due to changes in the database structure between versions.\n\n## Feature Incompatibility\nSome features might not function properly after downgrading, as certain features in the newer version may rely on changes that are not present in the older version.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://coolify.io/docs/downgrade", "title": "Downgrading Coolify", "description": "Instructions for downgrading your self-hosted instance of Coolify.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 7, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 22:33:34", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "ogTitle": "Coolify Docs", "ogUrl": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "og:description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "twitter:site": "@coolifyio", "og:title": "Coolify Docs", "generator": "VitePress v1.6.3", "title": "Downgrading Coolify | Coolify Docs", "twitter:title": "Coolify Docs", "language": "en-US", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "twitter:url": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "twitter:image": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "favicon": "https://coolify.io/docs/coolify-logo-transparent.png", "ogDescription": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "og:url": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "og:image": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "theme-color": "#000000", "ogImage": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "og:type": "website", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "twitter:description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "scrapeId": "a186b7ab-3b77-4c25-8f82-4b1e797ea7e5", "sourceURL": "https://coolify.io/docs/downgrade", "url": "https://coolify.io/docs/downgrade", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful Coolify expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Change Localhost Key\"?\n\nAssistant: This guide will show you how to replace the stored localhost private key for Coolify.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Key deletion from database\nIn the Postgres database in which the data for Coolify is stored, there is a private_keys table. This table contains the private keys for all servers connected to the Coolify instance. Be careful to not accidentally delete the wrong keys, as there usually is no way to undo.\n\n1. Navigate to the private_keys table in the Postgres database for Coolify\n   - Said table is located under the public schema in the database.\n2. Select the row that is marked with:\n   - Row index and ID of 0, as well as the name of \"localhost's key\"\n3. Delete the selected row from the database\n   - If completed successfully, proceed to the next section.\n\nTip\nIt helps to do this with a graphical interface for managing the database.\n\n## Installing new keys in the host machine\nAfter the key has been deleted from the database, you need to add the new keys into the correct place in the Coolify data folders.\n\n1. Stop your Coolify instance completely.\n\n2. Find the /ssh/keys directory for your Coolify installation.\n   - Usually located in /data/ssh/keys if you followed the quick install.\n3. Write the public and private keys to the correct files\n   - Your ED25519 public key shall be stored in id.root@host.docker.internal.pub\n   - Your ED25519 private key shall be stored in id.root@host.docker.internal\n4. Start your Coolify instance\n   - Coolify will now proceed to seed your keys to the Postgres database.\n   - Make sure the Database\\Seeders\\PopulateSshKeysDirectorySeeder does not error.\n\nNote\nIf you receive an output of \"SSH key found for the Coolify host machine (localhost)\", the operation completed successfully and unless you get any other output, your new key shall now be working.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/change-localhost-key", "title": "Change Localhost Key", "description": "This guide will show you how to replace the stored localhost private key for Coolify.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 2, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 22:36:49", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"description": "How to replace the localhost key for Coolify.", "ogTitle": "Coolify Docs", "og:type": "website", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "favicon": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/coolify-logo-transparent.png", "ogUrl": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "og:description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "twitter:site": "@coolifyio", "ogDescription": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "ogImage": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "title": "Change Localhost Key | Coolify Docs", "og:url": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "og:image": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "twitter:title": "Coolify Docs", "twitter:description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "language": "en-US", "generator": "VitePress v1.6.3", "theme-color": "#000000", "og:title": "Coolify Docs", "twitter:url": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "twitter:image": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "scrapeId": "d8df1a96-e9b0-4a1c-ac3e-e7fade03fa16", "sourceURL": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/change-localhost-key", "url": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/change-localhost-key", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful Coolify expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Access All Resource via Cloudflare Tunnels\"?\n\nAssistant: Accessing All Resource deployed on Coolify using a Cloudflare Tunnel allows you to securely reach your app without exposing your server’s IP address or without having a Public IP address for the server.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Who this is for?\nThis setup is ideal for people who:\n\n- Don't have a public IP for their server (could be a laptop, rasberry pi etc..).\n- Are unable to port forward (e.g., using home internet or on a private network).\n- Want to keep their server’s IP address private and avoid exposing it to the public internet.\n- Have an resource already deployed on Coolify and need an external method to access it securely.\n\n## Setup Requirements\nTo follow this guide, you'll need:\n\n- A free Cloudflare account.\n- You need a domain that has it's DNS managed by Cloudflare.\n\n## Before We Start\n- We assume you have Coolify running on your server.\n- If your app requires HTTPS for functionality like cookies or login, then you need to follow the Full TLS HTTPS guide after following this guide. This is because in this guide, Cloudflare will manage HTTPS externally, while your app will run over HTTP within Coolify.\n\n## How It Works?\nA simple high-level overview diagram to give you a visual idea of how this works:\n\n![High Level Diagram](https://coolify.io/docs/images/knowledge-base/cf-tunnel/all-resource/high-level-diagram.webp) \n\n### Quick Links to Important Sections:\n- [Create a Cloudflare Tunnel](https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/cloudflare/tunnels/all-resource#_1-create-a-cloudflare-tunnel)\n- [Setup Encryption mode on Cloudflare](https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/cloudflare/tunnels/all-resource#_2-setup-encryption-mode-on-cloudflare)\n- [Setup Cloudflare Tunnel on Coolify](https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/cloudflare/tunnels/all-resource#_3-setup-cloudflare-tunnel-on-coolify)\n- [Start Coolify Proxy](https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/cloudflare/tunnels/all-resource#_4-start-coolify-proxy)\n- [Configure Your Resource to Use the Tunnel Domain](https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/cloudflare/tunnels/all-resource#_5-configure-your-resource-to-use-the-tunnel-domain)\n- [How to use Mutiple Different Domains](https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/cloudflare/tunnels/all-resource#how-to-use-mutiple-different-domains)\n- [Known issues and Solutions](https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/cloudflare/tunnels/all-resource#known-issues-and-solutions) \n\nExample Data\n\nThe following data is used as an example in this guide. Please replace it with your actual data when following the steps:\n\n- **Domain Name:** shadowarcanist.com\n\n## 1. Create a Cloudflare Tunnel\nTo create a Cloudflare Tunnel, first log in to your Cloudflare account and go to the Zero Trust page.\n\n![Step 1](https://coolify.io/docs/images/knowledge-base/cf-tunnel/all-resource/1.webp)\n\n1. On the Zero Trust page, go to **Networks** in the sidebar.\n2. Click on **Tunnels**\n3. Click on **Add a tunnel** button\n\nYou will be prompted to choose a tunnel type. Click the **Select Cloudflared** button.\n\n![Step 2](https://coolify.io/docs/images/knowledge-base/cf-tunnel/all-resource/2.webp)\n\nYou will be prompted to enter a tunnel name. Choose a name that you prefer.\n\n![Step 3](https://coolify.io/docs/images/knowledge-base/cf-tunnel/all-resource/3.webp)\n\nNext you will see the configuration page with multiple options to install cloudflared.\n\n![Step 4](https://coolify.io/docs/images/knowledge-base/cf-tunnel/all-resource/4.webp)\n\nCopy the install command, which contains the token for your tunnel (token starts with \"eyJ\"). Make sure to save only the token, removing the command part before it, and store it in a safe place, as we need it later.\n\n![Step 5](https://coolify.io/docs/images/knowledge-base/cf-tunnel/all-resource/5.webp)\n\nScroll down until you see the **Next** button, then click it.\n\nThen, you will be prompted to add a hostname.\n\n![Step 6](https://coolify.io/docs/images/knowledge-base/cf-tunnel/all-resource/6.webp)\n\n1. **Subdomain** - (Optional) You can make your all of your resource accessible on any subdomain/domain. For this guide, we are using a wildcard subdomain.\n2. **Domain** - Choose the domain you want to use for the tunnel.\n3. **Path** - Leave this field empty.\n4. **Type** - Choose **HTTP** (this is very important).\n5. **URL** - Enter **localhost:80** (this is very important).\n6. After filling in the details, click the **Save Tunnel** button.\n\n## 2. Setup Encryption mode on Cloudflare\nTo set up encryption on Cloudflare, follow these steps:\n\n![Step 15](https://coolify.io/docs/images/knowledge-base/cf-tunnel/all-resource/15.webp)\n\n1.

Click **Configure** button\n\n![Step 16](https://coolify.io/docs/images/knowledge-base/cf-tunnel/all-resource/16.webp)\n\nChoose **Full** as the encryption mode.\n\n## 3. Setup Cloudflare Tunnel on Coolify\nTo set up the tunnel on Coolify, follow these steps:\n\n![Step 7](https://coolify.io/docs/images/knowledge-base/cf-tunnel/all-resource/7.webp)\n\nGo to your project on Coolify dashboard and click the **\\+ New** button to create a new resource.\n\n![Step 8](https://coolify.io/docs/images/knowledge-base/cf-tunnel/all-resource/8.webp)\n\nYou will see many options to deploy a new app. Search for Cloudflared and click on it.\n\n![Step 9](https://coolify.io/docs/images/knowledge-base/cf-tunnel/all-resource/9.webp)\n\nGo to the **Environment Variables** page, enter your tunnel token, and deploy the Cloudflared app. This token was copied in Step 1.\n\n## 4. Start Coolify Proxy\nTo start the Coolify proxy, follow these steps:\n\n![Step 10](https://coolify.io/docs/images/knowledge-base/cf-tunnel/all-resource/10.webp)\n\n1. In the Coolify dashboard, go to the **Servers** page from the sidebar.\n2. Click on the **Proxy** tab.\n3. Open the **General** tab.\n4. Click the **Start Proxy** button.\n\n**Tip**: The Coolify proxy is used to route traffic to apps running on your server. This eliminates the need to create new hostnames on the Cloudflare tunnel every time you deploy a new app.\n\n## 5. Configure Your Resource to Use the Tunnel Domain\nEnter the domain you want to use for your resource/app and deploy your resource.\n\n![Step 11](https://coolify.io/docs/images/knowledge-base/cf-tunnel/all-resource/11.webp)\n\n**HEADS UP!**\n\nYou should enter the domain as **HTTP** because Cloudflare handles **HTTPS** and TLS terminations. If you use **HTTPS** for your resource, you may encounter a **TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS** error.\n\nIf your app requires **HTTPS** for features like cookies or login, follow the Full TLS HTTPS Guide after completing this guide.\n\n**Congratulations**! You've successfully set up a resource that can be accessed by anyone on the internet your domain.\n\n## How to use Mutiple Different Domains?\nYou don't need to create new tunnels for each domain, just create a new hostname with the new domain and point it to the `localhost:80`.\n\n![Step 12](https://coolify.io/docs/images/knowledge-base/cf-tunnel/all-resource/12.webp)\n\n## Known issues and Solutions\nWhen you create a new public hostname in Step 1, Cloudflare will create a DNS record for the hostname.\n\nHowever, if a DNS record for the hostname already exists, Cloudflare won’t create a new one.\n\nIn this case, your app won’t work. To fix this issue, follow the steps below:\n\n![Step 13](https://coolify.io/docs/images/knowledge-base/cf-tunnel/all-resource/13.webp)\n\nFirst, copy your tunnel ID from the Tunnels page on the Cloudflare dashboard.\n\n![Step 14](https://coolify.io/docs/images/knowledge-base/cf-tunnel/all-resource/14.webp)\n\nCreate a new DNS record with the following details:\n\n1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to **DNS**.\n2. Select **Records**.\n3. Add a **CNAME** record.\n4. Enter the name as `*` or the name of your subdomain (this should match the hostname you have for your app on the tunnel).\n5. For the **Target**, enter the tunnel ID followed by `.cfargotunnel.com`\n6. Set the proxy status to **Proxied**.\n\nNow, visit the domain of your application, and it should be accessible there.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/cloudflare/tunnels/all-resource", "title": "Access All Resource via Cloudflare Tunnels", "description": "Accessing All Resource deployed on Coolify using a Cloudflare Tunnel allows you to securely reach your app without exposing your server’s IP address or without having a Public IP address for the server.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 11, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 22:40:32", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"favicon": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/cloudflare/tunnels/coolify-logo-transparent.png", "ogDescription": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "og:title": "Coolify Docs", "language": "en-US", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "ogImage": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "ogTitle": "Coolify Docs", "og:description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "ogUrl": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "twitter:title": "Coolify Docs", "og:image": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "og:type": "website", "twitter:url": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "twitter:image": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "theme-color": "#000000", "twitter:description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "title": "Access All Resource via Cloudflare Tunnels | Coolify Docs", "generator": "VitePress v1.6.3", "og:url": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "twitter:site": "@coolifyio", "scrapeId": "91639644-376e-482f-8901-9e399bd61c37", "sourceURL": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/cloudflare/tunnels/all-resource", "url": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/cloudflare/tunnels/all-resource", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful Coolify expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Full HTTPS/TLS Setup for All Resources\"?\n\nAssistant: This guide solves issues with URL mismatches by configuring your resources to run fully on HTTPS, bypassing Cloudflare's HTTPS handling and ensuring your app functions correctly with secure connections.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Who this is for?\nThis guide is ideal for users who:\n\n- Have followed our Tunnel All Resources Using Cloudflare Tunnel or Tunnel Specific Resources Using Cloudflare Tunnel guide.\n- Need their resources deployed with Coolify to run on HTTPS for applications requiring HTTPS for JWT issuance, callback functions, or similar features.\n\n## Setup Requirements\nTo follow this guide, you'll need:\n\n- A working Cloudflare tunnel setup as described in the previous guides.\n- A domain configured in Cloudflare to handle HTTP traffic and redirect to HTTPS.\n\n## Before We Start\n- If your Coolify instance is on the same tunnel as the domain you want to configure, make sure you can access the Coolify Dashboard using the server IP and port (e.g., 203.0.113.1:8000) before starting these steps.\n- The default port is 8000, but if you’ve changed or disabled it, ensure you can access the Coolify Dashboard through the new port or that port 8000 is re-enabled on the server.\n\n## Quick Links to Important Sections\n- Create a Cloudflare Origin Certificate\n- Add Origin Certificate to Your Server\n- Configure Coolify to Use the Origin Certificate\n- Setup Encryption mode on Cloudflare\n- Configure Tunnel to Use HTTPS\n- Configure Cloudflare to Always Use HTTPS\n- Update URLs from HTTP to HTTPS\n\n## Example Data\nThe following data is used as an example in this guide. Please replace it with your actual data when following the steps:\n\n- IPv4 Address of Origin Server: 203.0.113.1\n- Domain Name: shadowarcanist.com\n- Username: shadowarcanist\n\n## 1. Create a Cloudflare Origin Certificate\nTo create your Cloudflare Origin Certificate, follow these steps:\n\n1. In your Cloudflare dashboard, go to SSL/TLS.\n2. Select Origin Server.\n3. Click the Create Certificate button.\n\nYou’ll be asked to choose a private key type, hostnames, and certificate validity.\n\n1. Choose RSA (2048) for the key type.\n2. Add the hostnames you want the certificate to cover.\n\nHEADS UP!\n\n- shadowarcanist.com will cover only the main domain.\n- *.shadowarcanist.com will cover all subdomains.\n\nOn Cloudflare’s free plan, wildcard certificates cover just one level of subdomains.\n\nFor example, it works for coolify.shadowarcanist.com but not www.coolify.shadowarcanist.com.\n\nTo cover multiple levels, you'll need to purchase the Advanced Certificate Manager.\n\n3. Set the certificate validity to 15 years.\n\nYour certificate will now be generated.\n\n1. Choose PEM as the key format.\n2. Copy your Certificate.\n3. Copy your Private Key.\n\nNext, you'll add these to your server running Coolify and configure Coolify to use this certificate.\n\n## 2. Add Origin Certificate to Your Server\nSSH into your server or use Coolify's terminal feature. For this guide, I’m using SSH:\n\n```\nssh shadowarcanist@203.0.113.1\n```\n\nOnce logged in, navigate to the Coolify proxy directory:\n\n```\ncd /data/coolify/proxy\n```\n\nCheck if you have a certs folder:\n\n```\nls\n> acme.json  docker-compose.yml  dynamic\n```\n\nIf there’s no certs folder, create it:\n\n```\nmkdir certs\n```\n\nVerify it was created:\n\n```\nls\n> acme.json  certs docker-compose.yml  dynamic\n```\n\nNow, navigate into the certs directory:\n\n```\ncd certs\n```\n\nCreate two new files for the certificate and private key:\n\n```\ntouch shadowarcanist.cert shadowarcanist.key\n```\n\nVerify the files were created:\n\n```\nls\n> shadowarcanist.cert shadowarcanist.key\n```\n\nOpen the shadowarcanist.cert file and paste the certificate from the Cloudflare dashboard:\n\n```\nnano shadowarcanist.cert\n```\n\nSave and exit after pasting the certificate.\n\nDo the same for the shadowarcanist.key file and paste the private key:\n\n```\nnano shadowarcanist.key\n```\n\nSave and exit.\n\nNow the origin certificate is installed on your server.\n\n## 3. Configure Coolify to Use the Origin Certificate\nNow, in your Coolify dashboard:\n\n1. Go to the Server section in the sidebar.\n2. Select Proxy.\n3. Open the Dynamic Configuration page.\n4. Click Add button.\n\nYou will now be prompted to enter the Dynamic Configuration.\n\n1. Choose a name for your configuration.\n2. Enter the following details in the configuration field:\n\n```\nyaml\ntls:\n  certificates:\n    -\n      certFile: /traefik/certs/shadowarcanist.cert\n      keyFile: /traefik/certs/shadowarcanist.key\n```\n\nAdding Multiple Certificates:\n\n```\nyaml\ntls:\n  certificates:\n    -\n      certFile: /traefik/certs/shadowarcanist.cert\n      keyFile: /traefik/certs/shadowarcanist.key\n    -\n      certFile: /traefik/certs/name2.cert\n      keyFile: /traefik/certs/name2.key\n    -\n      certFile: /traefik/certs/name3.cert\n      keyFile: /traefik/certs/name3.key\n```\n\n3. Save the configuration.\n\nFrom now on, Coolify will use the origin certificate for requests matching the hostname.\n\n## 4. Setup Encryption mode on Cloudflare\nTo set up encryption on Cloudflare, follow these steps:\n\n1. Go to SSL/TLS in Cloudflare.\n2. Select Overview.\n3. Click Configure button.\n\nChoose Full (Strict) as the encryption mode.\n\n## 5. Configure Tunnel to Use HTTPS\nTo configure the tunnel for HTTPS, follow these steps:\n\n1. Click the three dots icon to open the settings menu.\n2. Select Edit to allow hostname modifications.\n\nNext, update the hostnames as follows:\n\n1. Change the type from HTTP to HTTPS.\n2. Change the port from 80 to 443.\n\n3. Click on Additional Application Settings.\n4. Select TLS.\n5. Enter your root domain in the Origin Server Name field.\n6. Scroll down and click the Save Hostname button.\n\n## 6. Configure Cloudflare to Always Use HTTPS\n1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to SSL/TLS.\n2. Select Edge Certificates.\n3. Enable Always Use HTTPS.\n\n## 7. Update URLs from HTTP to HTTPS\nNow, update all URLs from HTTP to HTTPS in Coolify, including resources and the instance domain on the settings page.\n\nCongratulations! All your resources are now running on HTTPS at all times.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/cloudflare/tunnels/full-tls", "title": "Full HTTPS/TLS Setup for All Resources", "description": "This guide solves issues with URL mismatches by configuring your resources to run fully on HTTPS, bypassing Cloudflare's HTTPS handling and ensuring your app functions correctly with secure connections.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 12, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 22:41:12", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"twitter:site": "@coolifyio", "og:url": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "ogTitle": "Coolify Docs", "favicon": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/cloudflare/tunnels/coolify-logo-transparent.png", "ogDescription": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "ogImage": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "og:title": "Coolify Docs", "og:description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "og:image": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "twitter:url": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "generator": "VitePress v1.6.3", "og:type": "website", "ogUrl": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "language": "en-US", "twitter:title": "Coolify Docs", "description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "twitter:description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "title": "Full HTTPS/TLS Setup for All Resources | Coolify Docs", "theme-color": "#000000", "twitter:image": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "scrapeId": "5e511ac5-e0c8-4b77-a11c-17c3ac02d66a", "sourceURL": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/cloudflare/tunnels/full-tls", "url": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/cloudflare/tunnels/full-tls", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful Coolify expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Cloudflare Tunnels\"?\n\nAssistant: Cloudflare Tunnels allow you to securely expose your local server or applications to the internet without opening ports on your router.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Why Use Cloudflare Tunnels?\n- No need to open or forward ports on your device to the public internet.\n- Simplifies routing and DNS configuration.\n- Supports exposing a single application or multiple services.\n- Hides your server's IP address by routing traffic through a Cloudflare Tunnel, showing only your domain.\n- Works even if you have a dynamic IP (or) no public IP at all.\n- Eliminates the hassle of managing and setting up SSL certificates.\n\n## When Not to Use Cloudflare Tunnels?\n- If you prefer direct access to your server without a proxy layer.\n- If you're concerned about routing traffic through Cloudflare's servers.\n- If you rely on additional firewall tools, as Cloudflare Tunnels bypass all firewall rules.\n- If you need SSL certificates trusted by entities other than Cloudflare.\n\n## Ways to Use Cloudflare Tunnels with Coolify\nYou can set up Cloudflare Tunnels with Coolify in several ways, depending on your needs. Below are the available options, each linked to a detailed guide for easy setup:\n\n1. [All Resources](https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/cloudflare/tunnels/all-resource) - Use a tunnel for all resources deployed through Coolify. This is the **easiest** and **most recommended** way for beginners.\n\n2. [Single Resource](https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/cloudflare/tunnels/single-resource) - Use a tunnel for a single resource deployed through Coolify.\n\n3. [Server SSH Access](https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/cloudflare/tunnels/server-ssh) - Securely connect your server to Coolify using a domain through Cloudflare Tunnel.\n\n4.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful Coolify expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Access Single Resource via Cloudflare Tunnels\"?\n\nAssistant: Accessing an Resource deployed on Coolify using a Cloudflare Tunnel allows you to securely reach your app without exposing your server’s IP address or without having a Public IP address for the server.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Who this is for?\nThis setup is ideal for people who:\n\n- Don't have a public IP for their server (could be a laptop, rasberry pi etc..).\n- Are unable to port forward (e.g., using home internet or on a private network).\n- Want to keep their server’s IP address private and avoid exposing it to the public internet.\n- Have an app already deployed on Coolify and need an external method to access it securely.\n\n## Setup Requirements\nTo follow this guide, you'll need:\n\n- A free Cloudflare account.\n- You need a domain that has it's DNS managed by Cloudflare.\n- Your Resource has to be deployed and managed with Coolify.\n\n## Before We Start\n- We assume you have Coolify running and an app already deployed.\n- If your app requires HTTPS for functionality like cookies or login, then you need to follow the Full TLS HTTPS guide after following this guide. This is because in this guide, Cloudflare will manage HTTPS externally, while your app will run over HTTP within Coolify.\n\n## How It Works?\nA simple high-level overview diagram to give you a visual idea of how this works:\n\n![High Level Diagram](https://coolify.io/docs/images/knowledge-base/cf-tunnel/single-resource/high-level-diagram.webp)\n\n## Quick Links to Important Sections\n- [Setup your app for tunneling](https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/cloudflare/tunnels/single-resource#_1-setup-your-app-for-tunneling)\n- [Create a Cloudflare Tunnel](https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/cloudflare/tunnels/single-resource#_2-create-a-cloudflare-tunnel)\n- [Setup Cloudflare Tunnel on Coolify](https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/cloudflare/tunnels/single-resource#_3-setup-cloudflare-tunnel-on-coolify)\n- [Expose Multiple Resource on Different Domains](https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/cloudflare/tunnels/single-resource#expose-mutiple-resource-on-different-domains)\n- [Known issues and Solutions](https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/cloudflare/tunnels/single-resource#known-issues-and-solutions)\n\n## Example Data\nThe following data is used as an example in this guide. Please replace it with your actual data when following the steps:\n\n- **Domain Name:** shadowarcanist.com\n- **Ports Exposes:** 80\n- **Ports Mapping:** 4477:80\n\n## 1. Setup your app for tunneling\nTo setup your app for tunneling, follow these steps:\n\n1. Remove all domains from the **Domains** field.\n2. Set the correct port in **Ports Exposed** (the port your app uses).\n3. Set the correct ports in **Port Mappings** (left is the host port, right is the app port).\n4. Deploy your app by clicking the **Deploy** button.\n\n## 2. Create a Cloudflare Tunnel\nTo create a Cloudflare Tunnel, first log in to your Cloudflare account and go to the [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/) page.\n\n1. On the Zero Trust page, go to **Networks** in the sidebar.\n2. Click on **Tunnels**\n3. Click on **Add a tunnel** button\n\nYou will be prompted to choose a tunnel type. Click the **Select Cloudflared** button.\n\nYou will be prompted to enter a tunnel name. Choose a name that you prefer.\n\nNext you will see the configuration page with multiple options to install cloudflared.\n\nCopy the install command, which contains the token for your tunnel (token starts with \"eyJ\"). Make sure to save only the token, removing the command part before it, and store it in a safe place, as we need it later.\n\nScroll down until you see the **Next** button, then click it.\n\nThen, you will be prompted to add a hostname.\n\n1. **Subdomain** - (Optional) You can make your app/resource accessible on any subdomain/domain. For this guide, we are not using a subdomain.\n2. **Domain** - Choose the domain you want to use for the tunnel.\n3. **Path** - Leave this field empty.\n4. **Type** - Choose **HTTP** (this is very important).\n5. **URL** - Enter **localhost:4477** The port 4477 is the one we mapped to the host system in Step 1. Replace 4477 with your own port.\n6. After filling in the details, click the **Save Tunnel** button.\n\n## 3. Setup Cloudflare Tunnel on Coolify\nTo set up the tunnel on Coolify, follow these steps:\n\nGo to your project on Coolify dashboard and click the **\\+ New** button to create a new resource.\n\nYou will see many options to deploy a new app. Search for Cloudflared and click on it.\n\nGo to the **Environment Variables** page, enter your tunnel token, and deploy the Cloudflared app. This token was copied in Step 2.\n\n**Congratulations**! You've successfully set up a resource that can be accessed by anyone on the internet your domain.\n\n## Tunnel Multiple Resources\nThe easiest way to tunnel multiple resources is by following our [Tunnel All Resources](https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/cloudflare/tunnels/all-resource) guide, which uses Coolify's built-in proxy. However, if you prefer not to use the proxy, there are two alternative methods:\n\n- [Tunnel Multiple Single Resources](https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/cloudflare/tunnels/single-resource#tunnel-multiple-single-resources)\n- [Tunnel Coolify](https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/cloudflare/tunnels/single-resource#tunnel-coolify)\n\nTunneling multiple single resources is straightforward, but tunneling Coolify itself requires additional manual setup.\n\n## Tunnel Multiple Single Resources\nIf you want to expose different apps individually, you can follow our [Tunnel All Resources](https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/cloudflare/tunnels/all-resource), or take an alternate approach:\n\n1. Follow Step 1 for your new resource.\n2. Create a new public hostname on Cloudflare Tunnel as described in Step 2.\n\nThere’s no need to create a separate tunnel for each resources, simply create a new hostname and point it to the port your app is listening on.\n\n## Tunnel Coolify\nTunneling Coolify itself to make it accessible over a domain requires a bit more manual configuration. Here's how you can set it up:\n\n### 1. Create Public Hostnames in Cloudflare Tunnel\n\nFollow Step 2 from the main guide to create public hostnames for each service Coolify exposes. Use the following mapping:\n\n- **Hostnames**:\n\n1. `app.shadowarcanist.com` → `localhost:8000` (Coolify dashboard)\n2. `realtime.shadowarcanist.com` → `localhost:6001` (Realtime server)\n3. `app.shadowarcanist.com/terminal/ws` → `localhost:6002` (WebSocket terminal)\n- **Type**: HTTP (Ensure you select HTTP for each hostname.)\n\n### 2. Update Coolify’s `.env` File\n\nAfter creating public hostnames, update the `.env` file in your Coolify instance located at `/data/coolify/source` to enable connections to the realtime server. Add the following lines:\n\n```bash\nAPP_ID=<random string>\nAPP_KEY=<random string>\nAPP_NAME=Coolify\nDB_PASSWORD=<random string>\nPUSHER_APP_ID=<random string>\nPUSHER_APP_KEY=<random string>\nPUSHER_APP_SECRET=<random string>\nREDIS_PASSWORD=<random string>\n\n###########\n# Add these lines\nPUSHER_HOST=realtime.shadowarcanist.com\nPUSHER_PORT=443\n###########\n```\n\nThis ensures that Coolify uses the Cloudflare Tunnel for its realtime server.\n\n### 3. Restart Coolify\n\nRun the following command to restart Coolify and apply the changes:\n\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh | bash\n```\n\n### 4. Verify the Setup\n\n1. Access your Coolify dashboard at `https://app.shadowarcanist.com`.\n2. Test the realtime functionality by visiting `https://app.shadowarcanist.com/realtime` in another browser tab. You should see a notification about a test event.\n3. If you know what are you doing, you can check the network tab as well. Search for a websocket connection.\n\n## Known issues and Solutions\nWhen you create a new public hostname in Step 2, Cloudflare will create a DNS record for the hostname.\n\nHowever, if a DNS record for the hostname already exists, Cloudflare won’t create a new one.\n\nIn this case, your app won’t work. To fix this issue, follow the steps below:\n\nFirst, copy your tunnel ID from the Tunnels page on the Cloudflare dashboard.\n\nCreate a new DNS record with the following details:\n\n1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to **DNS**.\n2. Select **Records**.\n3. Add a **CNAME** record.\n4. Enter the name as `*` or the name of your subdomain (this should match the hostname you have for your app on the tunnel).\n5. For the **Target**, enter the tunnel ID followed by `.cfargotunnel.com`\n6. Set the proxy status to **Proxied**.\n\nNow, visit the domain of your application, and it should be accessible there.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/cloudflare/tunnels/single-resource", "title": "Access Single Resource via Cloudflare Tunnels", "description": "Accessing an Resource deployed on Coolify using a Cloudflare Tunnel allows you to securely reach your app without exposing your server’s IP address or without having a Public IP address for the server.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 13, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 22:45:33", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"title": "Access Single Resource via Cloudflare Tunnels | Coolify Docs", "ogUrl": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "og:description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "og:image": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "ogTitle": "Coolify Docs", "ogDescription": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "twitter:title": "Coolify Docs", "og:url": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "ogImage": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "twitter:description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "og:title": "Coolify Docs", "og:type": "website", "twitter:image": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "twitter:url": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "theme-color": "#000000", "language": "en-US", "generator": "VitePress v1.6.3", "twitter:site": "@coolifyio", "favicon": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/cloudflare/tunnels/coolify-logo-transparent.png", "scrapeId": "8f89fe90-ac4c-4318-a587-0fc5a4f18252", "sourceURL": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/cloudflare/tunnels/single-resource", "url": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/cloudflare/tunnels/single-resource", "statusCode": 200}}}

The user is the owner/admin of the team and no other owners/admins found, but the team **has members**:\n   - The ownership is transferred to the first user in the team who is not the owner/admin.\n   - The user is removed from the team.

You just need to go to the `Server` settings and set the `Wildcard Domain` field to your domain, for example `https://example.com`.\n\nThen if you create a new resource:\n\n- You will get a random subdomain for your application, for example `https://random.example.com`.\n- Also for your Preview Deployments, for example `https://<PRId>.random.example.com`.\n\nTip\n\nThe Preview URL template could be modified in the application's page / `Preview Deployments` tab.\n\n## Instance Domain\nIf you self-host Coolify, you can set your Coolify instance a custom domain in the `/settings` page.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/dns-configuration", "title": "DNS Configuration", "description": "This page covers the DNS configuration needed for deploying applications using Coolify, including setting up A records for domains and subdomains.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 4, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 22:49:22", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:title": "Coolify Docs", "ogUrl": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "ogDescription": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "twitter:site": "@coolifyio", "twitter:description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "twitter:url": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "twitter:image": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "og:type": "website", "description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "ogTitle": "Coolify Docs", "language": "en-US", "theme-color": "#000000", "favicon": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/coolify-logo-transparent.png", "twitter:title": "Coolify Docs", "og:description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "og:url": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "ogImage": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "generator": "VitePress v1.6.3", "og:image": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "title": "DNS Configuration | Coolify Docs", "scrapeId": "398de26e-2030-4de2-8c16-26260df878cf", "sourceURL": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/dns-configuration", "url": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/dns-configuration", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful Coolify expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Docker Compose\"?\n\nAssistant: If you are using Docker Compose based deployments, you need to understand how Docker Compose works with Coolify. In all cases the Docker Compose (docker-compose.y[a]ml) file is the single source of truth.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Defining environment variables\nCoolify will notice the environment variables you mention in your compose file and will display it in its UI.\n\n```yaml\nservices:\n  myservice:\n    environment:\n      - SOME_HARDCODED_VALUE=hello # Gets passed to the container but will not be visible in Coolify's UI\n      - SOME_VARIABLE=${SOME_VARIABLE_IN_COOLIFY_UI} # Creates an uninitialized environment variable editable in Coolify's UI\n      - SOME_DEFAULT_VARIABLE=${OTHER_NAME_IN_COOLIFY:-hello} # Creates an environment variable of value \"hello\" editable in Coolify's UI\n``` \n\n![Docker Compose Environment Variables UI](https://coolify.io/docs/images/screenshots/Docker-compose-environment-variables-UI.webp)\n\n## Coolify's magic environment variables\nAdditionally, Coolify can generate some dynamic environment variables for you. The syntax is `SERVICE_<TYPE>_<IDENTIFIER>`. Type may be one of:\n\n- **FQDN**: This will [generate](https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/server/introduction#wildcard-domain) an FQDN for the service. The example below shows how you can add paths and ports.\n- **URL**: Generates an URL based on the FQDN you have defined.\n- **USER**: Generates a random string using `Str::random(16)`. You might want to use it as a username in your service.\n- **PASSWORD**: Generates a password using `Str::password(symbols: false)`. Use `PASSWORD_64` to generate a 64 bit long password with `Str::password(length: 64, symbols: false)`.\n- **BASE64**: Generates a random string using `Str::random(32)`. For longer strings, use `BASE64_64` or `BASE64_128`.\n- **REALBASE64**: Encodes a randomly generated string using `base64_encode(Str::random(32))`. For longer strings, use `REALBASE64_64` or `REALBASE64_128`.\n\nEvery generated variable can be reused and will always have the same value for every service. All generated variables are displayed in Coolify's UI for environment variables and can be edited there (except FQDN and URL).\n\nAs an example, imagine an application with UUID `vgsco4o` (generated by Coolify on creation). It uses a compose file deploying Appwrite on the [wildcard](https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/server/introduction#wildcard-domain) domain `http://example.com`.\n\n```yaml\nservices:\n  appwrite:\n    environment:\n      # http://appwrite-vgsco4o.example.com/v1/realtime\n      - SERVICE_FQDN_APPWRITE=/v1/realtime\n      # _APP_URL will have the FQDN because SERVICE_FQDN_APPWRITE is just a simple environment variable\n      - _APP_URL=$SERVICE_FQDN_APPWRITE\n      # http://appwrite-vgsco4o.example.com/ will be proxied to port 3000\n      - SERVICE_FQDN_APPWRITE_3000\n      # http://api-vgsco4o.example.com/api will be proxied to port 2000\n      - SERVICE_FQDN_API_2000=/api\n      # Coolify generates password and injects it as SERVICE_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD into the container\n      - SERVICE_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD=${SERVICE_PASSWORD_APPWRITE}\n  not-appwrite:\n    environment:\n      # Same value as in Appwrite service\n      - APPWRITE_PASSWORD=${SERVICE_PASSWORD_APPWRITE}\n      # As SERVICE_FQDN_API is not the same as SERVICE_FQDN_APPWRITE\n      # Coolify will generate a new FQDN\n      # http://not-appwrite-vgsco4o.example.com/api\n      - SERVICE_FQDN_API=/api\n```\n\n## Storage\nYou can predefine storage normally in your compose file, but there are a few extra options that you can set to tell Coolify what to do with the storage.\n\n## Create an empty directory\n```yaml\n# Predefine directories with host binding\nservices:\n  filebrowser:\n    image: filebrowser/filebrowser:latest\n    volumes:\n      - type: bind\n        source: ./srv\n        target: /srv\n        is_directory: true # This will tell Coolify to create the directory (this is not available in a normal docker-compose)\n```\n\n## Create a file with content\nHere you can see how to add a file with content and a dynamic value that is coming from an environment variable.\n\n```yaml\nservices:\n  filebrowser:\n    image: filebrowser/filebrowser:latest\n    environment:\n      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password\n    volumes:\n      - type: bind\n        source: ./srv/99-roles.sql\n        target: /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init-scripts/99-roles.sql\n        content: |\n          -- NOTE: change to your own passwords for production environments\n           \\set pgpass `echo \"$POSTGRES_PASSWORD\"`\n\n           ALTER USER authenticator WITH PASSWORD :'pgpass';\n           ALTER USER pgbouncer WITH PASSWORD :'pgpass';\n```\n\n## Exclude from healthchecks\nIf you have a service that you do not want to be part of your overall healthchecks, you can exclude it from the healthchecks by setting the `exclude_from_hc` option to `true`.\n\nTip\n\nThis is useful for example if you have a migration service that runs only once and then the container stops.\n\n```yaml\nservices:\n  some-service:\n    exclude_from_hc: true\n    ...\n```\n\n## Connect to Predefined Networks\nBy default, each compose stack is deployed to a separate network, with the name of your resource uuid. This will allow to each service in your stack to communicate with each other.\n\nBut in some cases, you would like to communicate with other resources in your account. For example, you would like to connect your application to a database, which is deployed in another stack.\n\nTo do this you need to enable `Connect to Predefined Network` option on your `Service Stack` page, but this will make the internal Docker DNS not work as expected.\n\nHere is an example. You have a stack with a `postgres` database and a `laravel` application. Coolify will rename your `postgres` stack to `postgres-<uuid>` and your `laravel` stack to `laravel-<uuid>` to prevent name collisions.\n\nIf you set `Connect to Predefined Network` option on your `laravel` stack, your `laravel` application will be able to connect to your `postgres` database, but you need to use the `postgres-<uuid>` as your database host.\n\n## Raw Docker Compose Deployment\nYou can set up your project to use docker compose build pack to deploy your compose file directly without most of Coolify's magic. It is called `Raw Compose Deployment`.\n\nCaution\n\nThis is for advanced users. If you are not familiar with Docker Compose, we do not recommend this method.\n\n## Labels\nCoolify will still add the following labels (if they are not set) to your application:\n\n```yaml\nlabels:\n  - coolify.managed=true\n  - coolify.applicationId=5\n  - coolify.type=application\n```\n\nTo use Coolify's Proxy (Traefik), you need to set the following labels to your application:\n\n```yaml\nlabels:\n  - traefik.enable=true\n  - \"traefik.http.routers.<unique_router_name>.rule=Host(`coolify.io`) && PathPrefix(`/`)\"\n  - traefik.http.routers.<unique_router_name>.entryPoints=http\n```\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/docker/compose", "title": "Docker Compose", "description": "If you are using Docker Compose based deployments, you need to understand how Docker Compose works with Coolify.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful Coolify expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Docker Swarm\"?\n\nAssistant: This page covers the setup and installation of Docker Swarm in Coolify, including prerequisites, configuration, and deployment with persistent storage.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Setup in Coolify\nIf you would like to use a Swarm to deploy your resources, you need to add the `Swarm Manager` to Coolify.\n\nOptionally, you can add the `Swarm Workers` to Coolify. This will allow Coolify to do cleanups and other stuff on the `Swarm Workers`.\n\n## Docker Registry\nYou need to have an external Docker Registry available to use a Swarm, as all workers need to be able to pull the images you built with Coolify.\n\n- The Swarm Manager needs to push the image to the Docker Registry.\n- The Swarm Workers need to pull the image from the Docker Registry.\n\nSo set your docker login credentials accordingly. More information [here](https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/docker/registry).\n\n## Install Swarm Cluster\n> WIP This is just a brief guide to install a simple Docker Swarm cluster. For more information, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/).\n\n## Prerequisites\n- I will use [Hetzner](https://coolify.io/hetzner) (referral link) for this guide. You can use any other provider.\n- You need at least 3 servers to create a Docker Swarm cluster with the same architecture (ARM or AMD64).\n- 1 server for the manager node.\n- 2 servers for the worker nodes (you can add more worker nodes if you want).\n- Add private networking to all servers if possible.\n\n## Install Docker\nInstall Docker on all servers. You can follow the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) or:\n\n1. Install with Rancher script\n\nbash\n\n```\ncurl https://releases.rancher.com/install-docker/24.0.sh | sh\n```\n\n2. Install with Docker script\n\nbash\n\n```\ncurl https://get.docker.com | sh -s -- --version 24.0\n```\n\n> You only need to use one of the above commands.\n\n## Configure Docker\nOn `all servers`, run the following command to start Docker.\n\nbash\n\n```\nsystemctl start docker\nsystemctl enable docker\n```\n\nCaution\n\nHetzner specific configuration. Hetnzer servers use a MTU of 1450. You need to configure Docker to use the same MTU.\n\nOn the `manager`, run the following command to configure Docker.\n\nbash\n\n```\nmkdir -p /etc/docker\ncat <<EOF > /etc/docker/daemon.json\n{\n  \"default-network-opts\": {\n    \"overlay\": {\n      \"com.docker.network.driver.mtu\": \"1450\"\n    }\n  }\n}\nEOF\nsystemctl restart docker\n```\n\n## Create a Swarm cluster\n`On the manager node`, run the following command to create a new cluster.\n\nbash\n\n```\n# MANAGER_IP = IP of the manager node.

You need to use FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) format: `https://coolify.io`\n2. You can give multiple domains, separated by comma: `https://coolify.io,https://www.coolify.io`\n3. You can also add a port to the domain, so the proxy will know which port you would like to map to the domain: `https://coolify.io:8080,http://api.coolify.io:3000`\n\n## Wildcard Domain\nYou can set a wildcard domain ( `example: http://example.com`) to your server, so you can easily assign generated domains to all the resources connected to this server. [More details](https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/server/introduction#wildcard-domain)\n\n## DNS Validation\nSince version `beta.191`, Coolify will validates DNS records for your domains with `1.1.1.1` Cloudflare DNS server.\n\nIf you want to use different DNS server, go to your `Settings` page and change the `DNS Servers` field (comma separated list).\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/domains", "title": "Domains", "description": "You can easily add your own domains to Coolify or your resources.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": false, "section_count": 3, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 22:51:07", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"twitter:image": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "og:type": "website", "og:url": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "theme-color": "#000000", "language": "en-US", "og:description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "ogTitle": "Coolify Docs", "og:image": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "generator": "VitePress v1.6.3", "twitter:title": "Coolify Docs", "twitter:site": "@coolifyio", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "title": "Domains | Coolify Docs", "favicon": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/coolify-logo-transparent.png", "ogUrl": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "ogDescription": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "twitter:description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "ogImage": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "og:title": "Coolify Docs", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "twitter:url": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "scrapeId": "b39423f7-1b8d-4963-b38c-faad03d39022", "sourceURL": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/domains", "url": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/domains", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful Coolify expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Environment Variables\"?\n\nAssistant: You can define environment variables for your resources, and they will be available in your application.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Build Time Variables\nIf you would like to set environment variables for the build process, you can do it by setting the checkbox `Build Variable` in the normal view on the UI.\n\n## Shared Variables\nYou could have 3 types of shared variables:\n\n1. Team Based\n2. Project Based\n3. Environment Based (production, staging, etc.)\n\nYou can set shared variables on their respective pages.\n\nThen you can use these variables anywhere. For example: You defined `NODE_ENV` to `production`.\n\n## Team Based\nYou can set them on the `Team` page and use it with `{{team.NODE_ENV}}`. Do not replace \"team\" with your actual team name.\n\n## Project Based\nYou can set them on the `Projects` page, under the gear icon and use it with `{{project.NODE_ENV}}`. Do not replace \"project\" with your actual project name.\n\n## Environment Based\nYou can set them on the `Environments` page (select a `Project`), under the gear icon and use it with `{{environment.NODE_ENV}}` Do not replace \"environment\" with your actual environment name.\n\n## Using Shared Variables in Compose File\nIf you want to use the environment variables in your compose file, you can do so by using the following syntax:\n\n```bash\nenvironment:\n  - NODE_ENV=${NODE_ENV}\n```\n\nAnd then in the UI set `NODE_ENV` to your desired shared variable. For example if you want to use a team based variable (make sure you have the `NODE_ENV` variable set in the Team Variables):\n\n```bash\nNODE_ENV=${team.NODE_ENV}\n```\n\n## Predefined Variables\nCoolify predefines some variables for you, so you can use them in your application. All you need to do is to add an environment variable like this to your application.\n\n```bash\n# For example, you can use this variable in your application\nMY_VARIABLE=$SOURCE_COMMIT\n# You will have the commit hash of the source code in your application as an environment variable in MY_VARIABLE\n```\n\n## COOLIFY_FQDN\nFully qualified domain name(s) of the application.\n\n## COOLIFY_URL\nURL(s) of the application.\n\n## COOLIFY_BRANCH\nBranch name of the source code.\n\n## COOLIFY_RESOURCE_UUID\nUnique resource identifier generated by Coolify.\n\n## COOLIFY_CONTAINER_NAME\nName of the container generated by Coolify.\n\n## SOURCE_COMMIT\nCommit hash of the source code.\n\n## PORT\nIf not set: it is set to the `Port Exposes`'s first port.\n\n## HOST\nIf not set: it is set to `0.0.0.0`.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/environment-variables", "title": "Environment Variables", "description": "You can define environment variables for your resources, and they will be available in your application.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 15, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 22:51:26", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"ogUrl": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "og:description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "og:type": "website", "og:image": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "ogImage": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "ogTitle": "Coolify Docs", "title": "Environment Variables | Coolify Docs", "twitter:site": "@coolifyio", "twitter:image": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "og:url": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "language": "en-US", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "generator": "VitePress v1.6.3", "ogDescription": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "theme-color": "#000000", "og:title": "Coolify Docs", "favicon": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/coolify-logo-transparent.png", "description": "A guide how to use environment variables in Coolify.", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "twitter:title": "Coolify Docs", "twitter:url": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "twitter:description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "scrapeId": "cefb3752-3f1f-4065-8cbd-11daf96c3b6c", "sourceURL": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/environment-variables", "url": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/environment-variables", "statusCode": 200}}}

Reason: root@host.docker.internal: Permission denied (publickey).`\n\nYour Coolify instance cannot reach the server it is running on. During installation, a public key is generated to `/data/coolify/ssh/keys/id.root@host.docker.internal.pub` and automatically added to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.\n\nIf it is not added, you can add it manually by running the following command on your server:\n\n```bash\ncat /data/coolify/ssh/keys/id.root@host.docker.internal.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys\n```\n\n### Custom SSH Port\nIf you would like to use a custom SSH port, you can set it in the `Server` tab of your server.\n\nIf you are self-hosting Coolify, you can simply set it after you installed Coolify on the `localhost` server.\n\n### Increase Concurrent Builds\nIf you would like to increase the number of concurrent builds, you can set it in the `Server` tab of your server.\n\n### Coolify Cloud Public IPs\nIf you need the public facing IPs to allow inbound connections to your servers, here is an up-to-date list of IPs that you can use to whitelist:\n- [https://coolify.io/ipv4.txt](https://coolify.io/ipv4.txt)\n- [https://coolify.io/ipv6.txt](https://coolify.io/ipv6.txt)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/faq", "title": "Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)", "description": "This page contains frequently asked questions regarding Coolify, including server issues, Cloudflare configurations, and application settings.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 1, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 22:51:39", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"theme-color": "#000000", "ogDescription": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "language": "en-US", "og:title": "Coolify Docs", "og:description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "og:type": "website", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "twitter:description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "twitter:url": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "twitter:image": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "ogUrl": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "favicon": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/coolify-logo-transparent.png", "og:image": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "twitter:site": "@coolifyio", "twitter:title": "Coolify Docs", "title": "FAQ | Coolify Docs", "ogTitle": "Coolify Docs", "ogImage": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "og:url": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "generator": "VitePress v1.6.3", "scrapeId": "9021aa38-8593-4621-be20-901c9fa6a105", "sourceURL": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/faq", "url": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/faq", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful Coolify expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Bitbucket Integration\"?\n\nAssistant: This guide will show you how to use Bitbucket based repositories with Coolify.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Public Repositories\nYou can use public repositories without any additional setup.\n\n1. Select the `Public repository` option in the Coolify when you create a new resource.\n2. Add your repository URL to the input field, for example: `https://bitbucket.com/coolify-test2/coolify-examples`\n\nCaution\n\nYou can only use the https URL.\n\n1. That's it! Coolify will automatically pull the latest version of your repository and deploy it.\n\n## Private Repositories\nPrivate repositories require a few more steps to setup.\n\n1. Add a private key (aka `Deploy Keys`) to Coolify and to your Bitbucket repository in the `Repository Settings` / `Access Keys` menu.\n\nCaution\n\n- You can generate a new key pair with the following command:\n\nbash\n\n```\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \"deploy_key\"\n```\n\n- Or you can also use Coolify to generate a new key for you in the `Keys & Tokens` menu.\n\n2. Create a new resource and select the `Private Repository (with deploy key)`\n3. Add your repository URL to the input field, for example: `git@bitbucket.org:coolify-test2/coolify-examples.git`\n\nCaution\n\nYou need to use the SSH URL, so the one that starts with `git@`.\n\n4. That's it! Coolify will automatically pull the latest version of your repository and deploy it.\n\n## Automatic commit deployments with webhooks (Optional)\nYou can add a custom webhook URL to your Bitbucket repository to trigger a new deployment when you push to your repository.\n\nCaution\n\nThis can be set on either public or private repositories.\n\nIn your resource, there is a `Webhooks` menu. In the `Manual Git Webhooks` section, you can find the URL what you need to set in your Bitbucket repository.\n\n1. Set a secret key in the `Bitbucket Webhook Secret` input field.\n2. Go to your repository in Bitbucket and open the `Repository Settings` / `Webhooks` menu as `Repository hooks`.\n3. Add the URL from Coolify to the `URL` input field and the secret token.\n4. Select the `Push` option.\n5. That's it! Now when you push to your repository, Bitbucket will send a webhook request to Coolify and it will trigger a new deployment.\n\n## Merge request deployments with webhooks (Optional)\nYou can add a custom webhook URL to your Bitbucket repository to trigger a new deployment when you create a new merge request.\n\nCaution\n\nThis can be set on either public or private repositories.\n\nThe process is the same as the previous one.

You need to create a [GitHub Action workflow](https://github.com/andrasbacsai/github-actions-with-coolify/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yaml) file in your repository.\n\n2. You need to build your image and push it to a Docker registry. In the example, I use ghcr.io, but you can use any other registry.\n\n3. You need to create a [Coolify API Token](https://coolify.io/docs/api-reference/authorization) and add it to your GitHub repository secrets.\n\n   - `COOLIFY_TOKEN` in the example.\n4. In Coolify, you need to setup your deployment type. It could be a simple Dockerfile, Docker Compose or Docker Image based deployment.\n\n5. Get the proper webhook endpoint from Coolify (Your resource / `Webhook` menu) and add it to your GitHub repository secrets.\n\n   - `COOLIFY_WEBHOOK` in the example.\n6.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful Coolify expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Load Balancing on Hetzner\"?\n\nAssistant: Hetzner Cloud is a cloud hosting provider that offers a wide range of services. In this guide, we will show you how to deploy a load-balanced application with Coolify on Hetzner Cloud.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Introduction\nYour application is growing, and you need to scale it. One of the most common ways to scale an application is to use a load balancer. A load balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers, ensuring that no single server is overwhelmed. This can help improve the performance and reliability of your application.\n\nIn this guide, we will show you how to deploy a load-balanced application with Coolify on Hetzner Cloud. We will use two (or more) servers to host our application and a load balancer to distribute incoming traffic. We will also show you how to set up a database server if you need one.\n\nTip\n\nThe whole infrastructure costs around ~15€ per month.\n\n## Requirements\n- A domain name managed by Hetzner Cloud\n- 2 (or more) servers on Hetzner Cloud\n- A load balancer on Hetzner Cloud\n- Firewall rules to restrict access to your servers\n- Optional: A database server on Hetzner Cloud\n\n## Steps\n1. **Buy Servers**\n\nFirst, you need to buy two (or more) servers on Hetzner Cloud. You can choose the server type and location based on your requirements. Make sure to choose servers with enough resources to run your application.\n\n**Caution**\n\nMake sure you create and attach a private network to your servers. This will allow your servers to communicate with each other using a private network.\n\nIf you don't have an account on Hetzner Cloud, you can sign up with this [referral link](https://coolify.io/hetzner).\n\n2. **Add & validate them in Coolify**\n\nOnce you have bought the servers, you need to add them to Coolify. You can do this by clicking on the `Add Server` button in the Coolify dashboard and following the instructions.\n\nCoolify will automatically install the necessary software on your servers.\n\n3. **Optional: Deploy your database**\n\nIt is preferable to have a separate database server for your application. Not just for performance reasons, but also for security reasons. Also in this way you can connect your applications to a centralized database server.\n\nSkip this step if you don't need a database server or if you already have one hosted elsewhere.\n\nOnce you have bought the database server, and added it to Coolify, deploy your preferable database type (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) on it.\n\n**Caution**\n\nWe won't use a reverse proxy in this guide. We will bind the database to the public IP address of the server. We will use a firewall to restrict access to the database server.\n\nYou can stop them on the `Server` tab and switch to a `None` proxy type.\n\nMake sure you set the `Ports Mappings` correctly to allow your application servers to connect to the database server.\n\n   - PostgreSQL: `5432:5432`\n   - MySQL: `3306:3306`\n   - MariaDB: `3306:3306`\n   - MongoDB: `27017:27017`\n\n4. **Deploy your applications**\n\nNow it's time to deploy your application on the app servers. Details of deploying your application will depend on the type of application you are deploying.\n\nWith Coolify, you can attach more than one server to the same application. This will allow you to deploy your application on multiple servers.\n\n**Caution**\n\nWe won't use a reverse proxy in this guide. We will bind the application to the public IP address of the server, as the load balancer will handle the routing.\n\nYou can stop them on the `Server` tab and switch to a `None` proxy type.\n\nMake sure you set the `Ports Mappings` correctly to forward your application ports to the public IP address of the server.\n\nIf your application uses a database, make sure you update the database connection string to point to the database server.\n\n**Tip**\n\nHetzner Cloud has a private network feature that allows you to connect your servers using a private network. This can help improve the security and performance of your application.\n\nMake sure you enable the private network feature on your servers and use it in the database connection string.\n\nTest if your application is working correctly by accessing the public IP address and port of the server in your browser.\n\n5. **Add & configure the loadbalancer**\n\nNow it's time to add a load balancer to distribute incoming traffic across your servers.\n\nThis loadbalancer will do the following:\n\n   - Distribute incoming traffic across your servers\n   - Terminates TLS connections (makes your application secure with HTTPS and forwards the traffic to your servers over HTTP)\n   - Health checks your servers and routes traffic to healthy servers\n\nYour application is running on `port 8000` on both servers and you have a domain name `example.com`.\n\n01. Go to the Hetzner Cloud Console and click on `Load Balancers` in the left sidebar.\n02. Click on the `Create Load Balancer` button.\n03. Select a region where your servers are located.\n04. Select the private network that you have created for your servers.\n05. Select all servers in the targets section. **Important: `(use the private network)`.**\n06. In the services, delete the default service and add a `TLS Termination` predefined service.\n07. As `Destination Port` enter `8000` (source port should be `443`).\n08. Add a certificate for your domain name. It will generate a certificate for your domain name using Let's Encrypt.\n09. In the `health check` section, configure the health check endpoint to your application health check endpoint. (just an endpoint that returns `200 OK`).\n10. Optional: Sticky sessions can be enabled, which will make sure that a user is always routed to the same server for a time period, otherwise, the load balancer will distribute the traffic randomly across your servers.\n11. Choose an algorithm.\n12. And finally name your load balancer and click on `Create & Buy now`.\n\nWait for the load balancer to be created and healthy. Once it's healthy, you can check if your application is accessible via the loadbalancer's IP address.\n\n6. **Setup DNS**\n\nNow it's time to point your domain name to the `load balancer's IP address`. You can do this by adding an `A` record to your domain name provider's DNS settings.\n\n1. Go to your DNS settings.\n2. Add an `A` record with the domain name and the value of the load balancer's IP address.\n3. Save the changes and wait for the DNS changes to propagate.\n\nOnce the DNS changes have propagated, you should be able to access your application using your domain name.\n\n7. **Setup Firewall**\n\nHetzner Cloud offers a firewall feature that allows you to restrict access to your servers. We will use this feature to restrict access to your servers.\n\nAs the load balancer communicates with your servers over the private network, we only need to add rules for the public IP addresses.\n\nThe `Inbound` rules includes everything that is allowed. Everyting else is blocked by default.\n\n1. Go to the Hetzner Cloud Console and click on `Firewalls` in the left sidebar.\n2. Click on the `Create Firewall` button.\n3. Add SSH access rule for your IP address to the `Inbound` rules.\n4. Add your servers to the `Apply rule` section.\n5. Name your firewall and click on `Create Firewall`.\n\n**Tip**\n\nOptional: You can add more rules to allow access to specific ports or IP addresses if needed.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/how-to/hetzner-loadbalancing", "title": "Load Balancing on Hetzner", "description": "Hetzner Cloud is a cloud hosting provider that offers a wide range of services.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful Coolify expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Scalability\"?\n\nAssistant: If your application needs load balancing or high availability here are the options you have in Coolify: Traditional Horizontal Scaling and Docker Swarm.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Traditional Horizontal Scaling\nWith traditional horizontal scaling, you can deploy your applications on multiple servers, and then use a load balancer to distribute the traffic across them.\n\nThis is the most common type of scaling, and it is easy to understand and implement.\n\n### Coolify requirements\n1. **Add servers**\n   - You need to add and validate the servers in Coolify.\n2. **Set a Docker Registry** for your application\n   - **Why?** As several servers will need to access the same built image, it needs to be stored in a shared location.\n\n### Infrastructure requirements\n1. **Load balancer**\n2. **Firewall** - optional, but recommended\n\n### Examples\nWhich one is the best?\nIt depends on your needs, but we recommend the `one domain across multiple servers`.\n\nTip\nWe also recommend to use [Hetzner](https://coolify.io/hetzner) (referral link) for the servers.\n\n**(The cloud version of Coolify - and all of our other services - is also using Hetzner)**\n\n#### One domain across multiple servers (Recommended)\n![load-balance-one-domain](https://coolify.io/docs/images/loadbalancer/one-domain.webp)\n- **Pros**:\n  - Easy to understand and implement.\n  - Easy to manage.\n  - Easy to scale.\n  - No proxy required on the servers.\n  - Healthcheck are available for the application, not for the server - see the other option's cons.\n- **Cons**:\n  - You need a firewall on each server to prevent the servers from being accessed directly - most VPS providers has software firewalls.\n\n#### Multiple domains across multiple servers (Recommended, but more complex)\n![load-balance-multiple-domains](https://coolify.io/docs/images/loadbalancer/multiple-domains.webp)\n- **Pros**:\n  - Easy to understand and implement.\n  - Easy to manage.\n  - Easy to scale.\n  - Requires a proxy on the servers - Coolify automatically configures the proxy for you, but it is +1 component that can fail.\n  - \"Less expensive\" (as one server can host multiple applications).\n- **Cons**:\n  - As a plus proxy is added, there is a small performance hit as the proxy needs to be initialized on each server - not noticable for most use cases.\n  - You need bigger servers to host more applications, as more applications will be running on the same server.\n  - Healthcheck are not available for each application, only for the server.\n\n## Docker Swarm\nCoolify supports Docker Swarm (experimental). You can read more about it [here](https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/docker/swarm).\n\n## Kubernetes (planned)\nIt is just planned, but not in the roadmap yet, so no ETA. Coolify will eventually support Kubernetes.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful Coolify expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Terminal\"?\n\nAssistant: Coolify provides a powerful built-in web terminal that offers seamless access to all your resources directly from your browser. This feature enhances your ability to manage and interact with your infrastructure efficiently.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Key features\n1. **Universal Access**: Available for all resources **managed by Coolify**. Any containers or servers.\n2. **Supports colors, text editing, and more**: Uses [xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org/) under the hood, so you get a fully featured terminal experience.\n3. **Eliminates the need for external SSH clients**: This integrated terminal eliminates the need for external SSH clients or complex connection setups, streamlining your workflow and improving productivity.\n\n## Is it secure?\nYes, it is. The terminal commands are executed within the Coolify environment and through a secure SSH connection, so you can be sure that your commands are executed securely.\n\n## How to access?\nYou can access the terminal from the sidebar.\n\n## How does it works exactly?\nThe terminal is a web-based interface that allows you to interact with your resources using a terminal emulator and the web-to-terminal communication is passed through a Websocket connection.\n\nAfter that, it creates a new process on the Terminal server (inside Coolify's realtime container) and connects to your main Coolify instance container, via SSH.\n\nBut the connection is not direct, it goes first through a Websocket connection, requiring an authentication to do so, after that, the connection is established inside Coolify's main Instance (host server), to make sure that we have the permissions to access the resources.\n\nAnd then, the process inside the Coolify's main Instance container, establishes a new SSH connection to the target resource (container or server).

{"text": "System: You are a helpful Coolify expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Notifications\"?\n\nAssistant: Coolify provides a robust notification system that supports multiple channels. You can configure notifications in the Notifications tab of your Coolify dashboard.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Notification Providers\nBelow are guides for setting up supported notification providers in Coolify.\n\n## Email\nINFO\n\nEmail notifications can be configured using either SMTP or Resend.\n\n1. Navigate to Notifications → Email\n\n2. Choose your email provider:\n\n   - Use system wide (transactional) email settings (if you self-host Coolify, you can set this up in the Instance Settings - If you use Coolify Cloud, this is set up for you).\n   - SMTP Server\n   - Resend\n3. Configure your chosen provider:\n\n#### System-Wide Email Settings\n\n- Enable the `Use system wide (transactional) email settings` checkbox\n- If you're setting this up yourself, please refer to the [SMTP Server Configuration](https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/notifications#smtp-server-configuration) section below for detailed settings.\n\n#### SMTP Server Configuration\n\n- Fill in the following fields:\n  - `From Name` \\- Display name for the sender\n  - `From Address` \\- Email address notifications will come from\n  - `Host` \\- SMTP server hostname (e.g., smtp.mail.com)\n  - `Port` \\- SMTP port:\n    - Port 587 - StartTLS port (most widely supported)\n    - Port 465 - TLS/SSL port (recommended for highest security)\n  - `Username` \\- SMTP authentication username\n  - `Password` \\- SMTP authentication password\n  - `Encryption` \\- Choose your encryption method:\n    - StartTLS - Starts unencrypted then upgrades to TLS via StartTLS (typically used with port 587)\n    - TLS/SSL - Uses TLS encryption from the start (typically used with port 465 - automatically puts `ssl://` in front of the host)\n    - None - No encryption (NOT recommended as it is highly insecure)\n  - `Timeout` \\- Connection timeout in seconds\n- Enable the SMTP Server via the `Enabled` checkbox\n\nTip\n\nWe recommend using TLS/SSL encryption with port 465 for the most secure connection. This provides encryption from the start of the connection.\n\nINFO\n\nSome hosting providers have specific port restrictions. For example, Hetzner blocks port 465 by default. Check with your hosting provider about port availability and any required configuration changes.\n\n#### Resend Configuration\n\n- Enter your `Resend API Key`\n- Enable the `Resend` checkbox\n\n4. Click `Send Test Email` to verify your setup.\n\n## Telegram\n1. Initial Setup (Setup only possible on phone)\n\n   - Create a Telegram account using your phone number\n   - Open the Telegram app on your phone\n   - Go to Settings → Profile\n   - Set up a username (recommended)\n2. Create Your Bot\n\n   - Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)\n   - Send the `/newbot` command\n   - Follow BotFather's instructions to create your bot\n   - Copy the `Bot Token` when displayed\n\nINFO\n\nAfter copying your bot token, delete the message containing it from Telegram. Store the token securely as anyone with access to it can control your bot.\n\n3. Create and add your bot to a group\n\n   - Create a new group in Telegram\n   - Add your bot to the group (you can add it by using the bot name chosen while creating the bot)\n4. Make the bot an admin of the group\n\n   - Click on the group name\n   - Locate the members list\n   - Click on the bot name\n   - Click on Add to group or channel\n   - Choose the group\n   - Enable the admin toggle\n   - Click on Add bot as admin\n5. Enable Topics (Optional, Setup only possible on phone)\n\n   - Open the group on your phone\n   - Tap the group name\n   - Tap the pencil icon (edit)\n   - Find and enable Topics (this enables threads for the group)\n   - You can now create topics using the 3-dot menu in the group (also works on desktop)\n6.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful Coolify expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Basic Auth Middleware\"?\n\nAssistant: This page covers the configuration of Basic Auth Middleware for Traefik, including examples for standard applications and Docker Compose based applications.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Standard Applications\nThe configuration is slightly different for Standard Applications and Docker Compose based applications/one-click services.\n\n```bash\ntraefik.http.middlewares.<random_unique_name>.basicauth.users=test:$2y$12$ci.4U63YX83CwkyUrjqxAucnmi2xXOIlEF6T/KdP9824f1Rf1iyNG\ntraefik.http.routers.<unique_router_name>.middlewares=<random_unique_name>\n```\n\nIn the example above, we are using `test` as username and `test` as password.\n\nINFO\n\nYou most likely have a `traefik.http.middlewares` label already set. In that case, you must append the `random_unique_name` middleware to the existing value. For example:\n\n```bash\ntraefik.http.routers.<unique_router_name>.middlewares=gzip,<random_unique_name>\n```\n\nNote: The `<random_unique_name>` and `<unique_router_name>` are placeholders. You need to replace them when you add them to your own labels section. The `<random_unique_name>` is a unique name for the middleware and you need to make that up yourself. The `<unique_router_name>` is the unique name for the router that Coolify has already generated for you.\n\n## An ngnix Simple Web Container Example\nLet's say you have an ngnix simple web container that was generated by Coolify with the following Dockerfile:\n\n```Dockerfile\nFROM nginx:alpine\nCOPY . /usr/share/nginx/html\n```\n\nThe `Container Labels` generated by Coolify would look like this:\n\n```bash\ntraefik.enable=true\ntraefik.http.middlewares.gzip.compress=true\ntraefik.http.middlewares.redirect-to-https.redirectscheme.scheme=https\ntraefik.http.routers.http-0-wc04wo4ow4scokgsw8wow4s8.entryPoints=http\ntraefik.http.routers.http-0-wc04wo4ow4scokgsw8wow4s8.middlewares=redirect-to-https\ntraefik.http.routers.http-0-wc04wo4ow4scokgsw8wow4s8.rule=Host(`ngnixsite.mysite.com`) && PathPrefix(`/`)\ntraefik.http.routers.http-0-wc04wo4ow4scokgsw8wow4s8.service=http-0-wc04wo4ow4scokgsw8wow4s8\ntraefik.http.routers.https-0-wc04wo4ow4scokgsw8wow4s8.entryPoints=https\ntraefik.http.routers.https-0-wc04wo4ow4scokgsw8wow4s8.middlewares=gzip\ntraefik.http.routers.https-0-wc04wo4ow4scokgsw8wow4s8.rule=Host(`ngnixsite.mysite.com`) && PathPrefix(`/`)\ntraefik.http.routers.https-0-wc04wo4ow4scokgsw8wow4s8.service=https-0-wc04wo4ow4scokgsw8wow4s8\ntraefik.http.routers.https-0-wc04wo4ow4scokgsw8wow4s8.tls.certresolver=letsencrypt\ntraefik.http.routers.https-0-wc04wo4ow4scokgsw8wow4s8.tls=true\ntraefik.http.services.http-0-wc04wo4ow4scokgsw8wow4s8.loadbalancer.server.port=80\ntraefik.http.services.https-0-wc04wo4ow4scokgsw8wow4s8.loadbalancer.server.port=80\ncaddy_0.encode=zstd gzip\ncaddy_0.handle_path.0_reverse_proxy={{upstreams 80}}\ncaddy_0.handle_path=/*\ncaddy_0.header=-Server\ncaddy_0.try_files={path} /index.html /index.php\ncaddy_0=https://ngnixsite.73rdst.com\ncaddy_ingress_network=coolify\n```\n\nIf you want to add basic authentication to this service, assuming you want to name your auth middleware `mybasicauth`, you could add the following label below the first line `traefik.enable=true`:\n\n`traefik.http.middlewares.mybasicauth.basicauth.users=test:$2y$12$ci.4U63YX83CwkyUrjqxAucnmi2xXOIlEF6T/KdP9824f1Rf1iyNG`\n\nNotice that `mybasicauth` has replaced the `<random_unique_name>` placeholder. In other words, you have named your own auth middleware `mybasicauth`.\n\nThen you need to add the middleware to the router label, and since one or more middlewares are already set, you need to append the new middleware to the existing value.\n\nFor example you would update the current line\n\n`traefik.http.routers.http-0-wc04wo4ow4scokgsw8wow4s8.middlewares=redirect-to-https`\n\nto:\n\n`traefik.http.routers.https-0-wc04wo4ow4scokgsw8wow4s8.middlewares=gzip,mybasicauth`\n\nNotice that in this case `<unique_router_name>` has been replaced with `https-0-wc04wo4ow4scokgsw8wow4s8` which is the unique name for the router that Coolify has already generated for you.\n\nYour `ngnix` simple web container is protected by basic authentication.\n\n## Docker Compose And Services\nTo add `basicauth` middleware to your service, you need to add the following labels to your `docker-compose.yml` file:\n\n```yaml\nservices:\n  ngnix-simple-web-container::\n    image: 'nginx:alpine'\n    ports:\n      - '8080:80'\n    labels:\n      - 'traefik.http.middlewares.<random_unique_name>.basicauth.users=test:$2y$12$ci.4U63YX83CwkyUrjqxAucnmi2xXOIlEF6T/KdP9824f1Rf1iyNG'\n```\n\nYou should replace the placeholders `<random_unique_name>` with a unique name for the middleware. For example, you might name it `mybasicauth`, and then replace the placeholder with `mybasicauth`. That label would then look like this:\n\n```yaml\nlabels:\n  - 'traefik.http.middlewares.mybasicauth.basicauth.users=test:$2y$12$ci.4U63YX83CwkyUrjqxAucnmi2xXOIlEF6T/KdP9824f1Rf1iyNG'\n```\n\nWe have now added `basicauth` middleware to the `nginx-simple-web-container` service.\n\nYour `ngnix` simple web container is protected by basic authentication with a username of test and password of test.\n\nNote: When applying basic authentication labels, special characters like $, @, and , must be escaped to avoid parsing errors. That is for example, enclose the label values in quotes and use a backslash () before special characters if you're using double quotes.\n\n## How to generate user/password?\nYou need to set your username and password in the `basicauth.users` label.\n\nYou can generate one with the [htpasswd](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/programs/htpasswd.html) command:\n\n```bash\nhtpasswd -nbB test test\n```\n\nThis will generate a password hash for the user `test` with the password `test`. You can then replace `test` with the desired username and password. Then substitute the generated hash in the `basicauth.users` label above.\n\nNote: the `htpasswd` command is available on most Linux distributions. It is part of the `apache2-utils` package on Debian/Ubuntu and can be found [here](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/programs/htpasswd.html).\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/proxy/traefik/basic-auth", "title": "Basic Auth Middleware", "description": "This page covers the configuration of Basic Auth Middleware for Traefik, including examples for standard applications and Docker Compose based applications.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 4, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 22:56:06", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "language": "en-US", "og:type": "website", "og:url": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "og:image": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "twitter:image": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "twitter:url": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "og:description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "ogUrl": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "ogDescription": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "title": "Basic Auth Middleware | Coolify Docs", "ogImage": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "og:title": "Coolify Docs", "ogTitle": "Coolify Docs", "theme-color": "#000000", "generator": "VitePress v1.6.3", "twitter:site": "@coolifyio", "twitter:title": "Coolify Docs", "favicon": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/proxy/traefik/coolify-logo-transparent.png", "twitter:description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "scrapeId": "bb6b7734-1f9a-4d47-920a-c84811aee369", "sourceURL": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/proxy/traefik/basic-auth", "url": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/proxy/traefik/basic-auth", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful Coolify expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Custom SSL Certificates\"?\n\nAssistant: If you want to use custom SSL certificates with Traefik, you can easily do so by following the steps below.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Introduction\nOn each server, `/data/coolify/proxy` is mounted into the Coolify Proxy (Traefik) container. You can add your custom SSL certificates in the `/data/coolify/proxy/certs` directory.\n\n## Steps to Use Custom SSL Certificates\n1. Generate or request an SSL certificate Generate or request an SSL certificate for your domain. It can be a self-signed certificate, a certificate from a public CA, or a certificate from Let's Encrypt.\n\nRead more [here](https://certbot.eff.org/instructions) about certbot and Let's Encrypt.\n\n2.

Make sure you set the right DNS record for your domain. Your loadbalanced domain should point to the server's IP address where you are setting up the loadbalancer.\n2. You must deploy your application to more than one servers: read more [here](https://coolify.io/docs/docs/knowledge-base/server/multiple-servers).\n3. Make sure Traefik is running on all servers.\n4. Set your `fqdn` to the fqdn you would like to use to reach your application.\n5. After your application are deployed on all servers, you need to make a dynamic configuration for Traefik to loadbalance between your servers in the `/data/coolify/proxy/dynamic` directory.\n\n### Dynamic Configuration\nOn your Coolify's UI, you can go the your Server settings / Proxy tab where you can add the dynamic configuration.\n\nThe following configuration is valid if you would like to use https.\n\n```yaml\nhttp:\n  middlewares:\n    redirect-to-https:\n      redirectscheme:\n        scheme: https\n    gzip:\n      compress: true\n  routers:\n    lb-http:\n      middlewares:\n        - redirect-to-https\n      entryPoints:\n        - http\n      service: noop\n      # Change <CHANGE_THIS_TO_YOUR_DOMAIN> to your domain, like `example.com` without `https://`\n      rule: Host(`<CHANGE_THIS_TO_YOUR_DOMAIN>`)\n    lb-https:\n      middlewares:\n        - gzip\n      entryPoints:\n        - https\n      service: lb-https\n      tls:\n        certResolver: letsencrypt\n      # Change <CHANGE_THIS_TO_YOUR_DOMAIN> to your domain, like `example.com` without `https://`\n      rule: Host(`<CHANGE_THIS_TO_YOUR_DOMAIN>`)\n  services:\n    lb-https:\n      loadBalancer:\n        servers:\n          # Change <CHANGE_THIS_TO_YOUR_IP_ADDRESS> to your servers IP addresses\n          - url: 'http://<CHANGE_THIS_TO_YOUR_IP_ADDRESS>'\n          - url: 'http://<CHANGE_THIS_TO_YOUR_IP_ADDRESS>'\n          # Add any number of servers you want to loadbalance between\n    noop:\n      loadBalancer:\n        servers:\n          - url: ''\n```\n\nThe following configuration is valid if you would like to use http.\n\n```yaml\nhttp:\n  middlewares:\n    gzip:\n      compress: true\n  routers:\n    lb-http:\n      middlewares:\n        - gzip\n      entryPoints:\n        - http\n      service: lb-http\n      # Change <CHANGE_THIS_TO_YOUR_DOMAIN> to your domain, like `example.com` without `http://`\n      rule: Host(`<CHANGE_THIS_TO_YOUR_DOMAIN>`)\n  services:\n    lb-http:\n      loadBalancer:\n        servers:\n          # Change <CHANGE_THIS_TO_YOUR_IP_ADDRESS> to your servers IP addresses\n          - url: 'http://<CHANGE_THIS_TO_YOUR_IP_ADDRESS>'\n          - url: 'http://<CHANGE_THIS_TO_YOUR_IP_ADDRESS>'\n          # Add any number of servers you want to loadbalance between\n```\n\n## 2+ containers in one server\n### Prerequisites\n1. Make sure you set the right DNS record for your domain. Your loadbalanced domain should point to the server's IP address where you are setting up the loadbalancer.\n2. You must deploy your application to more than one containers in one server.\n3. Make sure Traefik is running on the server.\n\n### Dynamic Configuration\nThe following configuration is valid if you would like to use https.\n\n```yaml\nhttp:\n  middlewares:\n    redirect-to-https:\n      redirectscheme:\n        scheme: https\n    gzip:\n      compress: true\n  routers:\n    lb-https:\n      tls:\n        certResolver: letsencrypt\n      middlewares:\n        - gzip\n      entryPoints:\n        - https\n      service: lb-https\n      # Change <CHANGE_THIS_TO_YOUR_DOMAIN> to your domain, like `example.com` without `http://`\n      rule: Host(`<CHANGE_THIS_TO_YOUR_DOMAIN>`)\n    lb-http:\n      middlewares:\n        - redirect-to-https\n      entryPoints:\n        - http\n      service: noop\n      # Change <CHANGE_THIS_TO_YOUR_DOMAIN> to your domain, like `example.com` without `http://`\n      rule: Host(`<CHANGE_THIS_TO_YOUR_DOMAIN>`)\n  services:\n    lb-https:\n      loadBalancer:\n        servers:\n          # Change <UUID_OR_HOST.DOCKER.INTERNAL>:<PORT> to your containers UUID or host.docker.internal and port\n          # UUID is when you mapped a port to the host system\n          # host.docker.internal is when you are not exposed any port to the host system\n          - url: 'http://<UUID_OR_HOST.DOCKER.INTERNAL>:<PORT>'\n          - url: 'http://<UUID_OR_HOST.DOCKER.INTERNAL>:<PORT>'\n          # Add any number of containers you want to loadbalance between\n    noop:\n      loadBalancer:\n        servers:\n          - url: ''\n```\n\nThe following configuration is valid if you would like to use http.\n\n```yaml\nhttp:\n  middlewares:\n    gzip:\n      compress: true\n  routers:\n    lb-http:\n      middlewares:\n        - gzip\n      entryPoints:\n        - http\n      service: lb-http\n      # Change <CHANGE_THIS_TO_YOUR_DOMAIN> to your domain, like `example.com` without `http://`\n      rule: Host(`<CHANGE_THIS_TO_YOUR_DOMAIN>`)\n  services:\n    lb-http:\n      loadBalancer:\n        servers:\n          # Change <UUID_OR_HOST.DOCKER.INTERNAL>:<PORT> to your containers UUID or host.docker.internal and port\n          # UUID is when you mapped a port to the host system\n          # host.docker.internal is when you are not exposed any port to the host system\n          - url: 'http://<UUID_OR_HOST.DOCKER.INTERNAL>:<PORT>'\n          - url: 'http://<UUID_OR_HOST.DOCKER.INTERNAL>:<PORT>'\n          # Add any number of containers you want to loadbalance between\n```\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/proxy/traefik/load-balancing", "title": "Load-balancing", "description": "You can easily use Traefik to loadbalance an application between 2+ servers or 2+ containers in one server.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": false, "section_count": 2, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 22:57:13", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"theme-color": "#000000", "og:image": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "twitter:title": "Coolify Docs", "twitter:description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "ogImage": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "ogTitle": "Coolify Docs", "twitter:site": "@coolifyio", "ogDescription": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "og:url": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "ogUrl": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "language": "en-US", "twitter:url": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "favicon": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/proxy/traefik/coolify-logo-transparent.png", "og:description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "generator": "VitePress v1.6.3", "title": "Load-balancing | Coolify Docs", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:type": "website", "twitter:image": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "og:title": "Coolify Docs", "description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "scrapeId": "92f7f746-fae1-4a50-a8dc-e5d877282a62", "sourceURL": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/proxy/traefik/load-balancing", "url": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/proxy/traefik/load-balancing", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful Coolify expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Traefik Proxy\"?\n\nAssistant: Traefik is a modern, open-source reverse proxy and load balancer designed to handle incoming requests and route them to the appropriate services. It’s widely used in the container ecosystem, making it a perfect fit for projects running on Coolify.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Why Use Traefik?\n- Dynamically manages routing between your apps and the internet.\n- Integrates seamlessly with container orchestrators like Docker or Kubernetes.\n- Simplifies SSL/TLS certificate management, including support for Let's Encrypt.\n- Offers advanced features like load balancing and middleware for fine-grained control.\n- Comes with a built-in dashboard for monitoring routes and configurations.\n\n## When Not to Use Traefik?\n- If you need complete control over every aspect of your reverse proxy.\n- If you prefer using another reverse proxy solution like NGINX.\n- If you have highly customized or complex routing rules that Traefik might not fully support.\n\n## Ways to Use Traefik with Coolify\nCoolify automatically configures Traefik as your proxy. However, you can customize and extend Traefik's functionality based on your needs.\n\nBelow are some of the key features and ways you can use Traefik with Coolify:\n\n1. Basic Authentication - Add username and password protection to your applications.\n2. Custom SSL Certificates - Use your own SSL certificates instead of automatically generated ones.\n3. Dashboard - Enable Traefik’s built-in dashboard for real-time monitoring and insights.\n4. Dynamic Configuration - Manage dynamic configuration changes like routing rules or middlewares.\n5. Health Checks - Configure health checks to ensure your applications are running smoothly.\n6. Load Balancing - Distribute traffic across multiple app instances for better performance.\n7. Redirects - Set up HTTP-to-HTTPS redirection or create specific URL redirects.\n8. Wildcard Certificates - Secure multiple subdomains with a single SSL certificate.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/proxy/traefik/overview", "title": "Traefik Proxy", "description": "Traefik is a modern, open-source reverse proxy and load balancer designed to handle incoming requests and route them to the appropriate services.

You can find the required variables in the official documentation.\n\nIf you need fine-grained token, like with Cloudflare, check the provider configurations.\n\n## Configuration\n1. Setup your wildcard subdomain DNS records, `*.coolify.io`.\n2. Go to your Proxy settings (Servers / Proxy menu) and add the following configuration based on your providers.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful Coolify expert.\n\nUser: What are the best practices for \"Setup Wildcard SSL Certificates with Traefik\"?\n\nAssistant: Here are the recommended best practices:\n\n• Each provider needs environment variables to be set in the Traefik configuration. You can find the required variables in the official documentation.\n• If you need fine-grained token, like with Cloudflare, check the provider configurations.\n• You can also set `env_file` instead of `environment` in the example above, but then you need to create a `.env` file with the `HETZNER_API_KEY` variable on the server.\n• Change `--certificatesresolvers.letsencrypt.acme.dnschallenge.provider=hetzner` to your provider.\n• `traefik.http.routers.<unique_router_name_https>.tls.certresolver` should be the same as your `certresolver` name in Traefik proxy configuration, by default `letsencrypt`.\n• `traefik.http.services.<unique_service_name>.loadbalancer.server.port` should be the same as your application listens on. Port 80 if you use a static deployment.\n• You cannot use both configurations (Normal & SaaS) at the same time on one server.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/proxy/traefik/wildcard-certs", "title": "Setup Wildcard SSL Certificates with Traefik", "description": "This page provides instructions on how to set up wildcard SSL certificates using Traefik.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 3, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 22:58:22", "type": "best_practices", "page_metadata": {"ogUrl": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "og:url": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "ogImage": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "ogTitle": "Coolify Docs", "og:title": "Coolify Docs", "og:type": "website", "twitter:site": "@coolifyio", "twitter:title": "Coolify Docs", "theme-color": "#000000", "og:description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "description": "A guide to configure wildcard subdomain redirects (with Traefik wildcard certificates) in Coolify.", "twitter:url": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "title": "Wildcard SSL Certificates | Coolify Docs", "twitter:image": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "language": "en-US", "favicon": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/proxy/traefik/coolify-logo-transparent.png", "og:image": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "twitter:description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "generator": "VitePress v1.6.3", "ogDescription": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "scrapeId": "240eb2d3-1606-4541-aa61-c81e11e2231c", "sourceURL": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/proxy/traefik/wildcard-certs", "url": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/proxy/traefik/wildcard-certs", "statusCode": 200}}}
{"text": "System: You are a helpful Coolify expert.\n\nUser: What is \"AWS S3\"?\n\nAssistant: This page provides a comprehensive guide on how to set up and configure AWS S3 for use with Coolify.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## TLDR\n1. Create a bucket in AWS Console\n2. Create a custom policy in AWS Console with the following permissions:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n  \"Statement\": [\n    {\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Action\": [\n        \"s3:ListBucket\",\n        \"s3:GetObject\",\n        \"s3:DeleteObject\",\n        \"s3:GetObjectAcl\",\n        \"s3:PutObjectAcl\",\n        \"s3:PutObject\"\n      ],\n      \"Resource\": [\n        // rewrite your-bucket-name with your bucket name\n        \"arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name\",\n        \"arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n``` \n3. Create an IAM user in AWS Console & attach the policy from the previous step.\n4. Go to User settings & create an `Access Key` in AWS Console.\n5. Add the `Access Key` and `Secret Key` in Coolify when you create a new S3 source.\n\nTip: You need to use the S3 HTTP endpoint without the bucket name, for example, `https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com`.\n\n## Detailed steps\n### Create a bucket\n1. Create a bucket in AWS Console Go to [AWS Console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets) and create a new bucket.\n\n![Create Bucket](https://coolify.io/docs/images/aws-s3/1-bucket.webp)\n\n2. Name your bucket.\n\n![Name Bucket](https://coolify.io/docs/images/aws-s3/2-bucket.webp)\n\n### Create a new policy\n1. Create a new policy. Go to [AWS Console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home) and create a new policy.\n\n![Create Policy](https://coolify.io/docs/images/aws-s3/1-policy.webp)\n\n2. Name & configure your policy. Add the following JSON permissions to your policy (replace `your-bucket-name` with your bucket name):\n\n```json\n{\n     \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n     \"Statement\": [\n       {\n         \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n         \"Action\": [\n           \"s3:ListBucket\",\n           \"s3:GetObject\",\n           \"s3:DeleteObject\",\n           \"s3:GetObjectAcl\",\n           \"s3:PutObjectAcl\",\n           \"s3:PutObject\"\n         ],\n         \"Resource\": [\n           \"arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name\",\n           \"arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*\"\n         ]\n       }\n     ]\n}\n```\n\n![Configure Policy](https://coolify.io/docs/images/aws-s3/2-policy.webp)\n\n### Create a new IAM user\n1. Create a new IAM User. Go to [AWS Console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home) and create a new user.\n\n![Create IAM User](https://coolify.io/docs/images/aws-s3/1-iam.webp)\n\n2. Name your user.\n\n![Name IAM User](https://coolify.io/docs/images/aws-s3/2-iam.webp)\n\n3. Attach the policy created in the previous step.\n\n![Attach Policy](https://coolify.io/docs/images/aws-s3/3-iam.webp)\n\n4. Go to your user settings.\n\n![User Settings](https://coolify.io/docs/images/aws-s3/4-iam.webp)\n\n5. Create a new `Access Key`.\n\n![Create Access Key](https://coolify.io/docs/images/aws-s3/5-iam.webp)\n\n6. Set `Other` as use-case.\n\n![Set Use Case](https://coolify.io/docs/images/aws-s3/6-iam.webp)\n\n7. Copy the `Access Key` & `Secret Access Key`. You will need it to configure this S3 storage in Coolify.\n\n![Copy Access Key](https://coolify.io/docs/images/aws-s3/7-iam.webp)\n\n### Configure S3 in Coolify\n1. Add new S3 Storage. Go to your Coolify instance and create a new S3 storage.\n\n![Add S3 Storage](https://coolify.io/docs/images/aws-s3/1-coolify.webp)\n\n2. Add the details. Make sure you use the S3 HTTP endpoint without the bucket name. For example, `https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com`.\n\n![Configure S3 in Coolify](https://coolify.io/docs/images/aws-s3/2-coolify.webp)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/s3/aws", "title": "AWS S3", "description": "This page provides a comprehensive guide on how to set up and configure AWS S3 for use with Coolify.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 2, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 22:58:49", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"favicon": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/s3/coolify-logo-transparent.png", "ogImage": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "ogDescription": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "ogUrl": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "og:description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "twitter:site": "@coolifyio", "title": "AWS S3 | Coolify Docs", "og:url": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "og:type": "website", "twitter:image": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "language": "en-US", "generator": "VitePress v1.6.3", "og:title": "Coolify Docs", "og:image": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "twitter:description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "ogTitle": "Coolify Docs", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "twitter:title": "Coolify Docs", "theme-color": "#000000", "description": "Here you can find the documentation for configuring AWS S3 bucket in Coolify.", "twitter:url": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "scrapeId": "269203bd-4c9c-4eeb-a8b6-c68ebd775c44", "sourceURL": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/s3/aws", "url": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/s3/aws", "statusCode": 200}}}

Please note that disabling `Auto Update Enabled` will not disable the update check frequency as updates should be checked periodically.\n- If you disable `Auto Update Enabled`, you can still manually update Coolify by clicking the `Update` button once a new version is available.\n\n## Configuring Update Schedules\nBoth update frequencies use cron syntax for scheduling. For detailed information about the supported cron syntax, please see our [cron syntax guide](https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/cron-syntax).\n\n## Version Availability\nFor details about the availability and versioning scheme of new versions please read the [RELEASE.md](https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/blob/main/RELEASE.md) file on GitHub.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/self-update", "title": "Coolify Instance Updates - Self-hosted", "description": "This page covers the update settings and configurations for self-hosted Coolify instances.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 4, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 22:59:10", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"twitter:image": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "og:image": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "twitter:site": "@coolifyio", "og:title": "Coolify Docs", "ogImage": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "twitter:url": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "og:type": "website", "ogUrl": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "language": "en-US", "theme-color": "#000000", "og:url": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "og:description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "twitter:title": "Coolify Docs", "twitter:description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "favicon": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/coolify-logo-transparent.png", "ogDescription": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "title": "Coolify Instance Updates - Self-hosted | Coolify Docs", "generator": "VitePress v1.6.3", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "ogTitle": "Coolify Docs", "scrapeId": "8ea5912b-3d41-47ae-96db-fa90a9b21311", "sourceURL": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/self-update", "url": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/self-update", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful Coolify expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Adding a new service template to Coolify\"?\n\nAssistant: Services in Coolify are templates made from normal docker-compose files with some added Coolify magic.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## 1. Add metadata\nAt the top of your `docker-compose` file, add the following metadata:\n\n```yaml\n# documentation: https://docs.example.com/\n# slogan: A brief description of your service.\n# tags: tag1,tag2,tag3\n# logo: svgs/your-service.svg\n# port: 1234\n```\n\n- `documentation`: Link to the service's official documentation\n- `slogan`: A short description of the service\n- `tags`: Comma-separated list for better searchability\n- `logo`: Path to the service's logo (see step 3)\n- `port`: The main entrypoint port of the service\n\nCaution\n\nAlways specify a port, as Caddy Proxy cannot automatically determine the service's port.\n\n## 2. Create the docker-compose file\nBelow the metadata, add your docker-compose configuration. Use Coolify's environment variable magic [here](https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/docker/compose#coolifys-magic-environment-variables).\n\nExample:\n\n```yaml\nversion: '3.8'\nservices:\n     app:\n       image: your-service-image:tag\n       environment:\n      - DATABASE_URL=${COOLIFY_DATABASE_URL}\n    volumes:\n      - ${COOLIFY_VOLUME_APP}:/data\n```\n\n## 3. Add a logo\n- Create or obtain an SVG logo for your service (strongly preferred format)\n- If SVG is unavailable, use a high-quality.webp or JPG as a last resort\n- Add the logo file to the `svgs` folder in the Coolify repository\n- The logo filename should match the docker-compose service name exactly\n  - For example, if your service name is `wordpress`, your logo should be `wordpress.svg` and the final path then is `svgs/wordpress.svg` use this path in the `logo` metadata.\n\n## 4. Test your template\nUse the `Docker Compose` deployment option in Coolify to test your template. This process mimics the one-click service deployment.\n\n## 5. Submit a Pull Request\nOnce your template works correctly:\n\n- Open a [PR](https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/compare)\n- Add your new `<service>.yaml` compose file under `/templates/compose`\n- Include the logo file in the `svgs` folder\n\nINFO\n\nCoolify uses a [parsed version](https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/blob/main/templates/service-templates.json) of the templates for deployment.\n\n## Request a new service\nIf there's a service template you'd like to see in Coolify:\n\n1. Search [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/discussions/categories/service-template-requests) for existing requests.\n2. If the service has been requested, upvote it. If not, create a new request.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://coolify.io/docs/resource/contribute/service", "title": "Adding a new service template to Coolify", "description": "Services in Coolify are templates made from normal docker-compose files with some added Coolify magic.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 6, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 23:02:13", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:title": "Coolify Docs", "twitter:site": "@coolifyio", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "twitter:title": "Coolify Docs", "og:description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "theme-color": "#000000", "ogUrl": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "favicon": "https://coolify.io/docs/resource/contribute/coolify-logo-transparent.png", "ogTitle": "Coolify Docs", "title": "Add a new service template to Coolify | Coolify Docs", "twitter:description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "twitter:url": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "og:image": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "generator": "VitePress v1.6.3", "og:url": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "og:type": "website", "ogImage": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "twitter:image": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "ogDescription": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "language": "en-US", "scrapeId": "fb9f1615-ab23-4194-bd2a-0492b6c1e031", "sourceURL": "https://coolify.io/docs/resource/contribute/service", "url": "https://coolify.io/docs/resource/contribute/service", "statusCode": 200}}}

It can help you keep track of your expenses and income, so you can spend less and save more. Firefly III supports the use of budgets, categories and tags. Using a bunch of external tools, you can import data. It also has many neat financial reports available.\n\nFirefly III should give you insight into and control over your finances. Money should be useful, not scary. You should be able to see where it is going, to feel your expenses and to... wow, I'm going overboard with this aren't I?\n\nBut you get the idea: this is your money. These are your expenses. Stop them from controlling you. I built this tool because I started to dislike money. Having money, not having money, paying bills with money, you get the idea. But no more. I want to feel \"safe\", whatever my balance is. And I hope this tool can help you. I know it helps me.\n\n## Screenshots\n![Firefly III screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii/develop/.github/assets/img/imac-complete.png)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://coolify.io/docs/services/firefly-iii", "title": "Firefly III Documentation", "description": "This page provides an overview of Firefly III, a self-hosted personal finance manager.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": false, "section_count": 2, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 23:08:25", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"description": "Here you can find the documentation for hosting Firefly III with Coolify.", "og:type": "website", "og:title": "Coolify Docs", "og:image": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "twitter:site": "@coolifyio", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "ogUrl": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "ogTitle": "Coolify Docs", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "favicon": "https://coolify.io/docs/services/coolify-logo-transparent.png", "twitter:description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "twitter:image": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "twitter:url": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "ogDescription": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "theme-color": "#000000", "twitter:title": "Coolify Docs", "og:url": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "generator": "VitePress v1.6.3", "title": "Firefly III | Coolify Docs", "language": "en-US", "ogImage": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "scrapeId": "e9519fd7-f4ec-4197-b837-bb2e594a8336", "sourceURL": "https://coolify.io/docs/services/firefly-iii", "url": "https://coolify.io/docs/services/firefly-iii", "statusCode": 200}}}

It's easy to install and low maintenance, it just does the job.\n\n## Forgejo Actions Runner\nForgejo has available a first party \"actions runner\" to execute task jobs on a repository, much like GitHub Actions or GitLab CI.\n\nCoolify includes Forgejo services with a single runner, using Docker-in-Docker to handle and report task jobs.\n\nDue to the alpha status of the Forgejo runner, rebooting the Forejo application container after the initial setup is required to fully register the shared secret into Forejo for runners to validate:\n\n1. In the Environment Variables section of the service configuration, you may set as `RUNNER_SHARED_SECRET` a random 40-character hexagesimal string. The command `openssl rand -hex 20` creates something you can copy and paste.\n2. After successfully setting up Forejo, reboot the `forgejo` service and wait some seconds until the runner appears in Forgejo _Actions_ Configuration section.\n\nForejo is also compatible with third-party CI apps and platforms. Forgejo is a Gitea-fork, so instructions to incorporate these CI may be the same for both.\n\n## Demo\n- [Demo ›](https://next.forgejo.org/)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://coolify.io/docs/services/forgejo", "title": "Forgejo Documentation", "description": "This page provides an overview of Forgejo, its actions runner, and links to additional resources.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 3, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 23:08:33", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"theme-color": "#000000", "og:description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "twitter:site": "@coolifyio", "language": "en-US", "ogDescription": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "favicon": "https://coolify.io/docs/services/coolify-logo-transparent.png", "description": "Here you can find the documentation for hosting Forgejo with Coolify.", "ogUrl": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "twitter:title": "Coolify Docs", "twitter:image": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "og:title": "Coolify Docs", "generator": "VitePress v1.6.3", "twitter:description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "ogImage": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "og:url": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "title": "Forgejo | Coolify Docs", "twitter:url": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "ogTitle": "Coolify Docs", "og:image": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "og:type": "website", "scrapeId": "d0da88f1-960f-4289-b9b7-2777860925b5", "sourceURL": "https://coolify.io/docs/services/forgejo", "url": "https://coolify.io/docs/services/forgejo", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful Coolify expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Uninstalling Coolify\"?\n\nAssistant: Instructions for uninstalling Coolify from a self-hosted server.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## 1. Stop and Remove Containers\nStop all Coolify-related Docker containers and remove them to free up system resources.\n\nRun the following commands in your terminal:\n\n```sh\n  sudo docker stop -t 0 coolify coolify-realtime coolify-db coolify-redis coolify-proxy\n  sudo docker rm coolify coolify-realtime coolify-db coolify-redis coolify-proxy\n```\n\nThe `-t 0` flag ensures that the containers stop immediately without waiting for a timeout.\n\n## 2. Remove Docker Volumes\nTo remove the persistent data stored in Docker volumes for Coolify, run:\n\n```sh\n  sudo docker volume rm coolify-db coolify-redis\n```\n\nCAUTION!!\n\nRemoving volumes will delete all data stored in them permanently. Ensure you have backups if needed.\n\n## 3. Remove Docker Network\nCoolify uses a custom Docker network named coolify. Remove it with the following command:\n\n```sh\n  sudo docker network rm coolify\n```\n\n📌 Info\n\nIf you encounter an error indicating the network is in use, ensure that no containers are using the network before retrying.\n\n## 4. Delete Coolify Data Directory\nRemove the directory where Coolify stores its data on your server:\n\n```sh\n  sudo rm -rf /data/coolify\n```\n\nCAUTION!\n\nThis will permanently delete all Coolify-related data.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful Coolify expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Upgrading Coolify\"?\n\nAssistant: Instructions for upgrading your self-hosted instance of Coolify, including automatic, semi-automatic, and manual upgrade methods.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## 1. Automatic Upgrade\nCoolify automatically checks for new updates and will upgrade your instance to the latest version as soon as it becomes available. This ensures that your instance remains up to date without requiring any manual intervention.\n\n### How it works:\nThe automatic update feature is enabled by default, and Coolify will automatically pull the latest version from the official repository whenever a new version is released. Once the update is detected, the Coolify will begin the upgrade process without you needing to take any action.\n\n### Customizing Automatic Updates:\nIf you'd like to disable the auto-update feature, you can do so by navigating to the Settings menu in your Coolify dashboard.\n\n📌 Info\nDisabling automatic updates may be helpful if you want to test a new version on a staging environment first, or if you require more control over when updates are applied to your instance.\n\n## 2. Semi-Automatic Upgrade\nFor users who want to stay up to date but prefer some control over when the update happens, Coolify offers a semi-automatic upgrade option. In this method, Coolify will notify you whenever a new version is available, and you can choose when to apply the update.\n\n### How it works:\nIf an update is available, you will see an Upgrade button in the Navigation bar within the Coolify interface. Clicking this button will start the upgrade process, allowing you to update Coolify to the latest version.\n\n### Configuring Update Checks:\nYou can configure how often Coolify checks for updates within the Settings menu. Coolify will notify you based on the interval you set, allowing you to choose the frequency of update checks (e.g., daily, weekly, etc.).\n\n📌 Info\nThis method is great for users who want to review the new version notes or test the upgrade process in a controlled manner before applying the update to their production environment.\n\n## 3. Manual Upgrade\nIf you prefer to have full control over when and how your instance is updated, you can manually upgrade your Coolify instance by running a simple command. This method is ideal for advanced users who prefer to execute the update themselves and want more control over the process.\n\n### How it works:\nTo manually upgrade your Coolify instance, open the terminal on your server and execute the following command:\n\n```sh\ncurl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh | sudo bash\n```\n\nThis command will download and execute the official Coolify installation script. The script will check for the latest version and perform the necessary upgrade steps.\n\n### What the Script Does:\nThe script automatically downloads the latest version of Coolify from the official repository and installs it over your current installation.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://coolify.io/docs/upgrade", "title": "Upgrading Coolify", "description": "Instructions for upgrading your self-hosted instance of Coolify, including automatic, semi-automatic, and manual upgrade methods.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 3, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 23:25:51", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"theme-color": "#000000", "language": "en-US", "generator": "VitePress v1.6.3", "og:title": "Coolify Docs", "twitter:description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "favicon": "https://coolify.io/docs/coolify-logo-transparent.png", "ogTitle": "Coolify Docs", "og:url": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "title": "Upgrading Coolify | Coolify Docs", "ogDescription": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "og:type": "website", "og:image": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "twitter:image": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "ogImage": "https://coolcdn.b-cdn.net/assets/coolify/og-image-docs.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "ogUrl": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "twitter:url": "https://coolify.io/docs/", "og:description": "Self hosting with superpowers: An open-source & self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative.", "twitter:title": "Coolify Docs", "twitter:site": "@coolifyio", "scrapeId": "c366abad-d826-4a03-9a54-01f58a055454", "sourceURL": "https://coolify.io/docs/upgrade", "url": "https://coolify.io/docs/upgrade", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful Coolify expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Cloudflare Origin Certificate\"?\n\nAssistant: The Cloudflare Origin Certificate ensures secure communication between your server and Cloudflare when using Cloudflare’s Proxy, CDN, and security features.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Why Use Cloudflare Origin Certificate with Coolify?\n1. No need for HTTP or DNS challenges to create certificates.\n2. Keep port 80 closed — everything happens securely over TLS.\n3. Longer certificate validity (15 years) — once set up, you don’t need to worry about renewing every few months.\n\n## When to Avoid Using Cloudflare Origin Certificate\n1. If you need a free certificate for subdomains with multiple levels (e.g., app.sub.domain.com).\n2. The certificate is only trusted by Cloudflare, meaning if Cloudflare is down, nobody can access your apps and websites (via your domain).\n\n## Example Data\nThe following data is used as an example in this guide. Please replace it with your actual data when following the steps:\n\n- **IPv4 Address of Origin Server:** 203.0.113.1\n- **Domain Name:** shadowarcanist.com\n- **Username:** shadowarcanist\n\n## 1. Create the Origin Certificate\nTo create your Cloudflare Origin Certificate, follow these steps:\n\n1. In your Cloudflare dashboard, go to **SSL/TLS**.\n2. Select **Origin Server**.\n3. Click the **Create Certificate** button.\n\nYou’ll be asked to choose a private key type, hostnames, and certificate validity.\n\n1. Choose **RSA (2048)** for the key type.\n2. Add the hostnames you want the certificate to cover.\n\nHEADS UP!\n\n- **`shadowarcanist.com`** will cover only the main domain.\n- **`*.shadowarcanist.com`** will cover all subdomains.\n\nOn Cloudflare’s free plan, wildcard certificates cover just one level of subdomains.\n\nFor example, it works for **`coolify.shadowarcanist.com`** but not **`www.coolify.shadowarcanist.com`**.\n\nTo cover multiple levels, you'll need to purchase the [Advanced Certificate Manager ↗](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/advanced-certificate-manager/)\n\n3. Set the certificate validity to **15 years**.\n\nYour certificate will now be generated.\n\n1. Choose **PEM** as the key format.\n2. Copy your **Certificate**.\n3. Copy your **Private Key**.\n\nNext, you'll add these to your server running Coolify and configure Coolify to use this certificate.\n\n## 2. Add Certificate to Your Server\nSSH into your server or use Coolify's terminal feature. For this guide, I’m using SSH:\n\n```\nssh shadowarcanist@203.0.113.1\n```\n\nOnce logged in, navigate to the Coolify proxy directory:\n\n```\n$ cd /data/coolify/proxy\n```\n\nCheck if you have a **certs** folder:\n\n```\n$ ls\n> acme.json  docker-compose.yml  dynamic\n```\n\nIf there’s no **certs** folder, create it:\n\n```\n$ mkdir certs\n```\n\nVerify it was created:\n\n```\n$ ls\n> acme.json  certs docker-compose.yml  dynamic\n```\n\nNow, navigate into the **certs** directory:\n\n```\n$ cd certs\n```\n\nCreate two new files for the certificate and private key:\n\n```\n$ touch shadowarcanist.cert shadowarcanist.key\n```\n\nVerify the files were created:\n\n```\n$ ls\n> shadowarcanist.cert shadowarcanist.key\n```\n\nOpen the **shadowarcanist.cert** file and paste the certificate from the Cloudflare dashboard:\n\n```\n$ nano shadowarcanist.cert\n```\n\nSave and exit after pasting the certificate.\n\nDo the same for the **shadowarcanist.key** file and paste the private key:\n\n```\n$ nano shadowarcanist.key\n```\n\nSave and exit.\n\nNow the origin certificate is installed on your server.\n\n## 3. Set Up DNS Records and TLS Encryption\nTo make the origin certificate work, configure your DNS records, enable TLS, and set up HTTP to HTTPS redirects in Cloudflare:\n\n1. In Cloudflare, go to **DNS**.\n2. Select **Records**.\n3. Add 2 A records:\n4. Enter name as **`shadowarcanist.com`** and `*`\n5. Use the **IP address** of your server as the content for both records.\n6. Set the proxy status to **Proxied** for better security.\n\nNext, set up TLS encryption:\n\n1. Go to **SSL/TLS** in Cloudflare.\n2. Select **Overview**.\n3. Click **Configure** button\n\nChoose **Full (Strict)** as the encryption mode.\n\nFinally, enable HTTP to HTTPS redirects:\n\n1. In Cloudflare, go to **SSL/TLS**\n2. Select **Edge Certificates**.\n3. Enable **Always Use HTTPS**.\n\n## 4. Configure Coolify to Use the Origin Certificate\nNow, in your Coolify dashboard:\n\n1. Go to the **Server** section in the sidebar.\n2. Select **Proxy**.\n3. Open the **Dynamic Configuration** page\n4. Click **Add** button\n\nYou will now be prompted to enter the Dynamic Configuration.\n\n1. Choose a name for your configuration.\n2. Enter the following details in the configuration field:\n\n```\ntls:\n  certificates:\n    -\n      certFile: /traefik/certs/shadowarcanist.cert\n      keyFile: /traefik/certs/shadowarcanist.key\n```\n\nAdding Multiple Certificates (click to view)\n\n```\ntls:\n  certificates:\n    -\n      certFile: /traefik/certs/shadowarcanist.cert\n      keyFile: /traefik/certs/shadowarcanist.key\n    -\n      certFile: /traefik/certs/name2.cert\n      keyFile: /traefik/certs/name2.key\n    -\n      certFile: /traefik/certs/name3.cert\n      keyFile: /traefik/certs/name3.key\n```\n\n3. Save the configuration\n\nFrom now on, Coolify will use the origin certificate for requests matching the hostname.\n\n## 5. Optional: Configure Traefik\nThis step is optional but recommended for cleaning up unnecessary settings while self-hosting.\n\nSince you’re using an Origin Certificate, you no longer need HTTP challenges or port 80 open.\n\n1. Go **Server** in the Coolify dashboard.\n2. Select **Proxy**.\n3. Open **Configuration**.\n4. Replace the configuration with this:\n\n```\n# Define external networks\nnetworks:\n  coolify:\n    external: true  # External network.\n\nservices:\n  # Traefik reverse proxy\n  traefik:\n    container_name: coolify-proxy  # Container name.\n    image: 'traefik:v3.1'  # Traefik image version.\n    restart: unless-stopped  # Auto-restart policy.\n    extra_hosts:\n      - 'host.docker.internal:host-gateway'  # Host communication.\n    networks:\n      - coolify  # Network connection.\n    ports:\n      - '443:443'  # Expose HTTPS port.\n    healthcheck:  # Health check configuration.\n      test: 'wget -qO- http://localhost:80/ping || exit 1'  # Ping endpoint for health check.\n      interval: 4s  # Health check interval.\n      timeout: 2s  # Health check timeout.\n      retries: 5  # Retry attempts.\n    volumes:\n      - '/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro'  # Docker socket access.\n      - '/data/coolify/proxy:/traefik'  # Traefik config volume.\n    command:\n      # Traefik configuration options\n      - '--ping=true'  # Enable ping for health check.\n      - '--ping.entrypoint=http'  # Use HTTP entrypoint for ping.\n      - '--entrypoints.http.address=:80'  # HTTP entry point for health checks.\n      - '--entrypoints.https.address=:443'  # HTTPS entry point.\n      - '--entrypoints.http.http.encodequerysemicolons=true'  # Enable query semicolon encoding.\n      - '--entryPoints.http.http2.maxConcurrentStreams=50'  # HTTP/2 max streams.\n      - '--entrypoints.https.http.encodequerysemicolons=true'  # Enable HTTPS query encoding.\n      - '--entryPoints.https.http2.maxConcurrentStreams=50'  # HTTPS/2 max streams.\n      - '--entrypoints.https.http3'  # Enable HTTP/3.\n      - '--providers.docker.exposedbydefault=false'  # Disable default exposure.\n      - '--providers.file.directory=/traefik/dynamic/'  # Dynamic config directory.\n      - '--certificatesresolvers.letsencrypt.acme.httpchallenge=false'  # Disable HTTP challenge for Let's Encrypt.\n      - '--providers.file.watch=true'  # Enable config file watching.\n      - '--providers.docker=true'  # Enable Docker provider.\n    labels:\n      - coolify.managed=true  # Managed by Coolify.\n      - coolify.proxy=true  # Proxy service.\n```\n\nNote\n\nThe comments in this configuration explain each line. You can remove the comments when copying it into your configuration.\n\nNext, you'll need to remove a few labels from your Dockerfile-based deployments.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful Coolify expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Server SSH Access via Cloudflare Tunnels\"?\n\nAssistant: Accessing your server using SSH over a Cloudflare Tunnel is a secure and easy way to connect to a remote server while keeping its IP address hidden. This guide explains how to set it up using Coolify's automated cloudflare tunnel installation.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Who this is for?\nThis setup is ideal for people who:\n\n- Want to keep their server's IP address private.\n- Want to close all SSH ports on their server.\n- Don’t want to rely on static public IPs for accessing their remote server.\n- Don't have a static public IP for the server (only applies if you're doing the manual setup).\n\n## Before We Start\n- We assume you already have a server running Coolify and you are looking to set up a tunnel to connect a different server to Coolify.\n- If you are trying to set up a tunnel on the server where Coolify is running and you don’t have any other servers to connect, you don’t need a SSH tunnel. Coolify already has full root access to the server it’s running on, so there’s no need for an SSH tunnel in this case.\n\n## How It Works?\nA simple high-level overview diagram to give you a visual idea of how this works:\n\n![](https://coolify.io/docs/images/knowledge-base/cf-tunnel/server-ssh/high-level-diagram.webp)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/cloudflare/tunnels/server-ssh", "title": "Server SSH Access via Cloudflare Tunnels", "description": "Accessing your server using SSH over a Cloudflare Tunnel is a secure and easy way to connect to a remote server while keeping its IP address hidden.
