      "npm stores cache data in an opaque directory within the configured `cache`, named `_cacache`. This directory is a `cacache`[](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/commands/<http:/npm.im/cacache>)-based content-addressable cache that stores all http request data as well as other package-related data. This directory is primarily accessed through `pacote`, the library responsible for all package fetching as of npm@5.",
      "All data that passes through the cache is fully verified for integrity on both insertion and extraction. Cache corruption will either trigger an error, or signal to `pacote` that the data must be refetched, which it will do automatically. For this reason, it should never be necessary to clear the cache for any reason other than reclaiming disk space, thus why `clean` now requires `--force` to run.",
      "There is currently no method exposed through npm to inspect or directly manage the contents of this cache. In order to access it, `cacache` must be used directly.",

The primary guarantee that the cache makes is that, if it does return data, that data will be exactly the data that was inserted.",
