Provide detailed, practical answers about npm usage.\n\nUser: What is the purpose of package-lock.json and how is it related to npm shrinkwrap?\n\nAssistant: The `package-lock.json` file is automatically generated for any operations where npm modifies either the `node_modules` directory or `package.json`. It describes the exact tree that was generated, such that subsequent installs are able to generate identical trees, regardless of intermediate dependency updates. The `npm shrinkwrap` command repurposes the `package-lock.json` into a publishable `npm-shrinkwrap.json` or creates a new one if it doesn't exist. This allows you to have a significant amount of control over the dependencies and their versions."}
{"text": "System: You are an AI assistant specialized in npm package management. Provide detailed, practical answers about npm usage.\n\nUser: What happens when I use the npm shrinkwrap command?\n\nAssistant: When you run the `npm shrinkwrap` command, npm creates a `npm-shrinkwrap.json` file or repurposes the existing `package-lock.json` file. This file is similar to `package-lock.json`, but it also includes details that are necessary for publication. Once this file is created, it will take precedence over the `package-lock.json` file. The purpose of this is to lock down the versions of a package's dependencies so when the package is installed, you can control exactly which versions of each dependency will be used."}
