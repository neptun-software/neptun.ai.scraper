Default theme colors are applied to all Highcharts visuals.\n\n## Creating a Highcharts visual\nUse the following procedure to create a Highcharts visual in Amazon QuickSight.\n\n01. Open the QuickSight console.\n02. Open the QuickSight analysis that you want to add a Highcharts visual to.\n03. On the application bar, choose Add, and then choose Add visual.\n04. On the Visual types pane, choose the Highcharts visual icon. An empty visual appears on the analysis sheet and the Properties pane opens on the left.\n05. In the Properties pane, expand the Display settings section and perform the following actions:\n    1. For Edit title, choose the paintbrush icon, enter the title that you want the visual to have, and then choose SAVE. Alternatively, choose the eyeball icon to hide the title.\n    2. (Optional) For Edit subtitle, choose the paintbrush icon, enter the subtitle that you want the visual to have, and then choose SAVE. Alternatively, choose the eyeball icon to hide the subtitle.\n    3. (Optional) For Alt text, add the alt text that you want the visual to have.\n06. Expand the Data point limit section. For Number of data points to show, enter the number of data points that you want the visual to show. Highcharts visuals can show up to 10,000 data points.\n07. Expand the Chart code section.\n08. Enter a JSON schema into the Chart code JSON editor. The editor provides contextual assistance and real time validation to ensure that your input JSON is configured properly. Any errors that QuickSight identifies can be viewed in the Errors dropdown. The example below shows a JSON schema that creates a lipstick chart that shows current year sales by industry.\n09. Choose APPLY CODE. QuickSight converts the JSON schema into a visual that appears in the analysis. To make changes to the rendered visual, update the appropriate properties in the JSON schema and choose APPLY CODE.\n10. (Optional) Open the Reference dropdown to access links to helpful Highcharts reference material.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/quicksight/latest/user/highchart.html", "title": "Using Highcharts - Amazon QuickSight", "description": "This page provides guidance on how to use Highcharts visuals in Amazon QuickSight, including creating custom chart types and configuring visuals using JSON schemas.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 5, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 19:56:23", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"description": "Work with Highchart visuals in Amazon QuickSight.", "this_doc_product": "Amazon QuickSight", "default_state": "highchart", "guide": "User Guide", "assets_root": "/assets", "pdf": "/pdfs/quicksight/latest/user/amazon-quicksight-user.pdf#highchart", "product": "Amazon QuickSight", "feedback-no": "feedbackno.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/quicksight/latest/user/highchart.html", "keywords": "data analysis,data insights,data visualization,dataviz,graphical data analysis,Amazon QuickSight", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "title": "Using Highcharts - Amazon QuickSight", "target_state": "highchart", "guide-locale": "en_us", "favicon": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/assets/images/favicon.ico", "tocs": "toc-contents.json", "feedback-item": "QuickSight", "feedback": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forms/aws-doc-feedback?hidden_service_name=QuickSight&topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/quicksight/latest/user/highchart.html", "feedback-yes": "feedbackyes.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/quicksight/latest/user/highchart.html", "language": "en-US", "abstract": "The Amazon QuickSight user guide contains how-to topics, and guides for creating data analyses, visualizations, and dashboards.", "this_doc_guide": "User Guide", "rss": "amazon-quicksight-doc-release-notes.rss", "forums": "https://repost.aws/tags/TAtoF6BGmuRdGfw2e14IBwEQ", "deployment_region": "IAD", "scrapeId": "a233c838-6295-4b65-ae23-73bbfb1be959", "sourceURL": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/quicksight/latest/user/highchart.html", "url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/quicksight/latest/user/highchart.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

TTL operations are metered in units of `TTL deletes`. One TTL delete is consumed per KB of data per row that is deleted or updated.\n\nFor example, to update a row that stores 2.5 KB of data and to delete one or more columns within the row at the same time requires three TTL deletes. Or, to delete an entire row that contains 3.5 KB of data requires four TTL deletes.\n```\n\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/keyspaces/latest/devguide/TTL.html", "title": "Expire data with Time to Live (TTL) for Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra)", "description": "Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra) Time to Live (TTL) helps you simplify your application logic and optimize the price of storage by expiring data from tables automatically.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 5, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 19:58:05", "type": "code_examples", "page_metadata": {"feedback-yes": "feedbackyes.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/keyspaces/latest/devguide/TTL.html", "title": "Expire data with Time to Live (TTL) for Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra) - Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra)", "assets_root": "/assets", "target_state": "TTL", "abstract": "Provides a conceptual overview of Amazon Keyspaces and includes detailed development instructions for using the various features.", "forums": "https://repost.aws/tags/TAPdItG87rQueCeGBoOHKEOg", "favicon": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/assets/images/favicon.ico", "default_state": "TTL", "deployment_region": "IAD", "guide-locale": "en_us", "feedback-no": "feedbackno.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/keyspaces/latest/devguide/TTL.html", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Use Time to Live (TTL) in Amazon Keyspaces to automatically expire data from tables, rows, and cells.", "keywords": "Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra),Amazon Keyspaces,Keyspaces,Cassandra,query,table,keyspace,row,Amazon,TTL,time to live,time-to-live", "rss": "amazon-keyspaces-release-notes.rss", "guide": "Developer Guide", "tocs": "toc-contents.json", "feedback": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forms/aws-doc-feedback?hidden_service_name=Helenus&topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/keyspaces/latest/devguide/TTL.html", "product": "Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra)", "this_doc_product": "Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra)", "feedback-item": "Helenus", "language": "en-US", "this_doc_guide": "Developer Guide", "pdf": "/pdfs/keyspaces/latest/devguide/AmazonKeyspaces.pdf#TTL", "scrapeId": "8689eead-dabf-4afe-96cc-31179d7d80db", "sourceURL": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/keyspaces/latest/devguide/TTL.html", "url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/keyspaces/latest/devguide/TTL.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

The syntax for chat applications policies follows the syntax for management policy types. For a complete discussion of that syntax, see Understanding management policy inheritance. This topic focuses on applying that general syntax to the specific requirements of the chat applications policy type.\n\nThe following example shows the basic syntax for a chat applications policy:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"chatbot\":{\n       \"platforms\":{\n          \"slack\":{\n             \"client\":{\n                \"@@assign\":\"enabled\" // enabled | disabled\n             },\n             \"workspaces\": { // limit 255\n                   \"@@assign\":[\\\n                      \"Slack-Workspace-Id\"\\\n                   ]\n             },\n             \"default\":{\n                \"supported_channel_types\":{\n                   \"@@assign\":[\\\n                      \"private\" // public | private\\\n                   ]\n                },\n                \"supported_role_settings\":{\n                   \"@@assign\":[\\\n                      \"user_role\" // user_role | channel_role\\\n                   ]\n                }\n             },\n             \"overrides\":{ // limit 255\n                \"Slack-Workspace-Id\":{\n                   \"supported_channel_types\":{\n                      \"@@assign\":[\\\n                         \"public\" // public | private\\\n                      ]\n                   },\n                   \"supported_role_settings\":{\n                      \"@@assign\":[\\\n                         \"user_role\" // user_role | channel_role\\\n                      ]\n                   }\n                }\n             }\n          },\n          \"microsoft_teams\":{\n             \"client\":{\n                \"@@assign\":\"enabled\"\n             },\n             \"tenants\":{ // limit 36\n                \"Microsoft-Teams-Tenant-Id\":{ // limit 36\n                   \"@@assign\":[\\\n                      \"Microsoft-Teams-Team-Id\"\\\n                   ]\n                }\n             },\n             \"default\":{\n                \"supported_role_settings\":{\n                   \"@@assign\":[\\\n                      \"user_role\" // user_role | channel_role\\\n                   ]\n                }\n             },\n             \"overrides\":{ // limit 36\n                \"Microsoft-Teams-Tenant-Id\":{ // limit 36\n                   \"Microsoft-Teams-Team-Id\":{\n                      \"supported_role_settings\":{\n                         \"@@assign\":[\\\n                            \"user_role\" // user_role | channel_role\\\n                         ]\n                      }\n                   }\n                }\n             }\n          },\n          \"chime\":{\n            \"client\":{\n               \"@@assign\":\"disabled\" // enabled | disabled\n            }\n         }\n       },\n       \"default\":{\n          \"client\":{\n             \"@@assign\":\"disabled\" // enabled | disabled\n          }\n       }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis chat applications policy includes the following elements:\n\n- The `chatbot` field key name. Chat applications policies always start with this fixed key name. It's the top line in this example policy.\n\n- Under `chatbot`, there is a `platforms` block, which contains the configuration for the different supported chat applications: Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Amazon Chime.\n\n## Chat applications policy examples\nThe example policies that follow are for information purposes only.\n\n### Example 1:  Allow only private Slack Channels in a specific workspace, disable Microsoft Teams, all authentication modes supported\n\n```json\n{\n   \"chatbot\": {\n      \"platforms\": {\n         \"slack\": {\n            \"client\": {\n               \"@@assign\": \"enabled\"\n            },\n            \"workspaces\": {\n               \"@@assign\": [\\\n                  \"Slack-Workspace-Id\"\\\n               ]\n            },\n            \"default\": {\n               \"supported_channel_types\": {\n                  \"@@assign\": [\\\n                     \"private\"\\\n                  ]\n               },\n               \"supported_role_settings\": {\n                  \"@@assign\": [\\\n                     \"channel_role\",\\\n                     \"user_role\"\\\n                  ]\n               }\n            }\n         },\n         \"microsoft_teams\": {\n            \"client\": {\n               \"@@assign\": \"disabled\"\n            }\n         },\n         \"chime\":{\n            \"client\":{\n               \"@@assign\":\"disabled\"\n            }\n         },\n         \"default\":{\n            \"client\":{\n               \"@@assign\":\"disabled\"\n            }\n         }\n      }\n   }\n}\n```\n\n**For Slack**\n\n- The Slack client is enabled.\n\n- Only the specific Slack workspace `Slack-Workspace-Id` is allowed.\n\n- The default settings are to allow only private Slack channels, Channel level IAM roles, and User level IAM roles.\n\n**For Microsoft Team**\n\n- The Microsoft Teams client is disabled.\n\n**For Amazon Chime**\n\n- The Amazon Chime client is disabled.\n\n## Tips and best practices\n- The `default` block at the bottom sets the client to be disabled, which disables Amazon Q Developer in chat applications across the organization unless overridden at a lower level. This default also disables any new chat application that Amazon Q Developer in chat applications supports. For example, if Amazon Q Developer in chat applications supports a new chat application, this default disables that newly supported chat application as well.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_chatbot_syntax.html", "title": "Chat applications policy syntax and examples - AWS Organizations", "description": "This topic describes chat applications policy syntax and provides examples.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 6, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 20:02:48", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"favicon": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/assets/images/favicon.ico", "description": "Learn more about chat applications policies by examining examples of policies.", "feedback-item": "Organizations", "forums": "https://repost.aws/tags/TA6BEgyePwRAKiMatMcHghcA", "target_state": "orgs_manage_policies_chatbot_syntax", "title": "Chat applications policy syntax and examples - AWS Organizations", "rss": "aws-organizations-release-notes.rss", "language": "en-US", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "assets_root": "/assets", "default_state": "orgs_manage_policies_chatbot_syntax", "deployment_region": "IAD", "this_doc_product": "AWS Organizations", "guide": "User Guide", "feedback-yes": "feedbackyes.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_chatbot_syntax.html", "this_doc_guide": "User Guide", "abstract": "Combine all of your AWS accounts into an organization to consolidate billing and to achieve new levels of control over your AWS accounts.", "tocs": "toc-contents.json", "pdf": "/pdfs/organizations/latest/userguide/organizations-userguide.pdf#orgs_manage_policies_chatbot_syntax", "feedback-no": "feedbackno.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_chatbot_syntax.html", "feedback": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forms/aws-doc-feedback?hidden_service_name=Organizations&topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_chatbot_syntax.html", "keywords": "organization,management account,member account,consolidated billing,consolidated billing family,organizational unit,OU,root,service control policy,policy,AI services opt-out policy,backup policy,SCP,chat applications policy,tag policy,panama policy,inheritance,chabot policy,policy syntax,policy examples", "product": "AWS Organizations", "guide-locale": "en_us", "scrapeId": "9563787c-daa8-477d-be4e-2f77768000fa", "sourceURL": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_chatbot_syntax.html", "url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_chatbot_syntax.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

The graph shows the CPU utilization and metrics to help you decide whether to scale up to a larger instance size. For information about the query syntax for CloudWatch Logs Insights, see CloudWatch Logs Insights query syntax.\n\nTo use CloudWatch, you need to export your Aurora PostgreSQL log files to CloudWatch. You can also modify your existing cluster to export logs to CloudWatch. For information about exporting logs to CloudWatch, see Turning on the option to publish logs to Amazon CloudWatch.\n\nYou need the Resource ID of your DB instance to query the CloudWatch Logs Insights. The Resource ID is available in the Configuration tab in your console.\n\n## Evaluating DB instance usage for Aurora PostgreSQL with CloudWatch metrics\nYou can use CloudWatch metrics to watch your instance throughput and discover if your instance class provides sufficient resources for your applications. For information about your DB instance class limits, go to Hardware specifications for DB instance classes for Aurora and locate the specifications for your DB instance class to find your network performance.\n\nIf your DB instance usage is near the instance class limit, then performance may begin to slow. The CloudWatch metrics can confirm this situation so you can plan to manually scale-up to a larger instance class.\n\nCombine the following CloudWatch metrics values to find out if you are nearing the instance class limit:\n\n- NetworkThroughput – The amount of network throughput received and transmitted by the clients for each instance in the Aurora DB cluster. This throughput value doesn't include network traffic between instances in the DB cluster and the cluster volume.\n- StorageNetworkThroughput – The amount of network throughput received and sent to the Aurora storage subsystem by each instance in the Aurora DB cluster.\n\nAdd the NetworkThroughput to the StorageNetworkThroughput to find the network throughput received from and sent to the Aurora storage subsystem by each instance in your Aurora DB cluster. The instance class limit for your instance should be greater than the sum of these two combined metrics.\n\nYou can use the following metrics to review additional details of the network traffic from your client applications when sending and receiving:\n\n- NetworkReceiveThroughput – The amount of network throughput received from clients by each instance in the Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster. This throughput doesn't include network traffic between instances in the DB cluster and the cluster volume.\n- NetworkTransmitThroughput – The amount of network throughput sent to clients by each instance in the Aurora DB cluster. This throughput doesn't include network traffic between instances in the DB cluster and the cluster volume.\n- StorageNetworkReceiveThroughput – The amount of network throughput received from the Aurora storage subsystem by each instance in the DB cluster.\n- StorageNetworkTransmitThroughput – The amount of network throughput sent to the Aurora storage subsystem by each instance in the DB cluster.\n\nAdd all of these metrics together to evaluate how your network usage compares to the instance class limit. The instance class limit should be greater than the sum of these combined metrics.\n\nThe network limits and CPU utilization for storage are mutual. When the network throughput increases, then the CPU utilization also increases. Monitoring the CPU and network usage provides information about how and why the resources are being exhausted.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraPostgreSQL_AnayzeResourceUsage.html", "title": "Using Amazon CloudWatch metrics to analyze resource usage for Aurora PostgreSQL", "description": "This page covers how to use Amazon CloudWatch metrics to analyze resource usage for Aurora PostgreSQL, including evaluating network throughput and DB instance usage.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 5, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 20:09:53", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"favicon": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/assets/images/favicon.ico", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "product": "Amazon Aurora", "guide-locale": "en_us", "tocs": "toc-contents.json", "this_doc_product": "Amazon Aurora", "default_state": "AuroraPostgreSQL_AnayzeResourceUsage", "this_doc_guide": "User Guide for Aurora", "pdf": "/pdfs/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-ug.pdf#AuroraPostgreSQL_AnayzeResourceUsage", "rss": "auroraupdates.rss", "keywords": "Amazon Relational Database Service,RDS,DB instance,Amazon Aurora,Aurora,Aurora PostgreSQL memory management,autovacuum workers,rds.memory_allocation_guard,rds.enable_memory_management", "feedback-no": "feedbackno.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraPostgreSQL_AnayzeResourceUsage.html", "target_state": "AuroraPostgreSQL_AnayzeResourceUsage", "forums": "https://repost.aws/tags/TAsibBK6ZeQYihN9as4S_psg", "feedback": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forms/aws-doc-feedback?hidden_service_name=RDS&topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraPostgreSQL_AnayzeResourceUsage.html", "title": "Using Amazon CloudWatch metrics to analyze resource usage for Aurora PostgreSQL - Amazon Aurora", "guide": "User Guide for Aurora", "feedback-yes": "feedbackyes.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraPostgreSQL_AnayzeResourceUsage.html", "description": "Steps to analyze resource usage for Aurora PostgreSQL using CloudWatch metrics.", "feedback-item": "RDS", "assets_root": "/assets", "language": "en-US", "deployment_region": "IAD", "abstract": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) documentation for Amazon Aurora (Aurora).

Personal folders are visible only to the person who owns them. You can't transfer ownership of personal folders to anyone else.\n\n- Shared folders: Shared folders organize work and simplify sharing among multiple people. To create and manage shared folders, you need to be a QuickSight administrator.\n\n- Shared restricted folders: A type of shared folder in QuickSight that ensures that assets remain in the shared folder. Assets that are created from assets that exist within a shared restricted folder must also stay in the restricted folder. Assets that are located in restricted folders can't be moved or shared outside of the restricted folder. For example, if you create a dataset that uses a data source that's located in a shared restricted folder, the new dataset can't be moved outside of that shared restricted folder.\n\nAssets that are located in a restricted folder can be moved within the restricted folder tree into one or more subfolders. Subfolders of restricted folders behave like restricted folders, but dependent assets can exist in different subfolders under the same root restricted folder. The root restricted folder acts as a boundary that all assets in all subfolders can exist in as long as they remain within the root folder tree. For example, a dataset that is located in one subfolder can use a data source that is located either another subfolder in the same folder tree or in the root folder. Any supported asset type can be created in a root folder or in any of its subfolders. Users can have different roles in different subfolders. Subfolder permissions are inherited from the parent folders of that subfolder.\n\nRestricted folders can only be created with the QuickSight CreateFolder API operation.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/quicksight/latest/user/folders.html", "title": "Organizing assets into folders for Amazon QuickSight", "description": "In Amazon QuickSight Enterprise edition, your team members can create personal and shared folders to add hierarchical structure to QuickSight asset management.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 4, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 20:48:19", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"language": "en-US", "guide-locale": "en_us", "tocs": "toc-contents.json", "feedback-yes": "feedbackyes.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/quicksight/latest/user/folders.html", "title": "Organizing assets into folders for Amazon QuickSight - Amazon QuickSight", "feedback-no": "feedbackno.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/quicksight/latest/user/folders.html", "keywords": "data analysis,data insights,data visualization,dataviz,graphical data analysis,Amazon QuickSight", "this_doc_guide": "User Guide", "abstract": "The Amazon QuickSight user guide contains how-to topics, and guides for creating data analyses, visualizations, and dashboards.", "feedback-item": "QuickSight", "favicon": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/assets/images/favicon.ico", "rss": "amazon-quicksight-doc-release-notes.rss", "target_state": "folders", "guide": "User Guide", "pdf": "/pdfs/quicksight/latest/user/amazon-quicksight-user.pdf#folders", "assets_root": "/assets", "forums": "https://repost.aws/tags/TAtoF6BGmuRdGfw2e14IBwEQ", "feedback": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forms/aws-doc-feedback?hidden_service_name=QuickSight&topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/quicksight/latest/user/folders.html", "description": "Learn how to organize your analytics assets for yourself and your team in Amazon QuickSight.", "default_state": "folders", "deployment_region": "IAD", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "product": "Amazon QuickSight", "this_doc_product": "Amazon QuickSight", "scrapeId": "a29188e2-7b56-4afe-a44a-e93675de038e", "sourceURL": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/quicksight/latest/user/folders.html", "url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/quicksight/latest/user/folders.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

Here are some examples of what you can do with EventBridge:\n\n**Get details about your job outputs**\nAWS Elemental MediaConvert provides details about your job outputs in the notification for the `COMPLETE` event. This information includes the location and file names of the job's media files and manifests. For details, see [Events with COMPLETE status](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/mediaconvert/latest/ug/ev_status_complete.html).\n\nFor information about job metrics sent to Amazon CloudWatch, see [Using CloudWatch with MediaConvert](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/mediaconvert/latest/ug/cloudwatch_metrics.html).\n\n**Set up email notifications for job status changes**\nTo set up an EventBridge event rule, see [Tutorial: Setting up email notifications for failed jobs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/mediaconvert/latest/ug/setting-up-cloudwatch-event-rules.html#mediaconvert_sns_tutorial).\n\nFor a list of all job status change notifications that you can set up event rules for, see [List of MediaConvert EventBridge events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/mediaconvert/latest/ug/mediaconvert_event_list.html).\n\n**Monitor the progress of your job**\n`STATUS_UPDATE` events provide information about what phase your job is in ( `PROBING`, `TRANSCODING`, and `UPLOADING`). For some jobs, MediaConvert provides an estimate of how far your job has progressed. This estimate is shown as a percentage of the total time from when your job leaves its queue to when your output files appear in your output Amazon S3 bucket.\n\nFor more information about `STATUS_UPDATE` events, see the table of event types in [List of MediaConvert EventBridge events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/mediaconvert/latest/ug/mediaconvert_event_list.html).\n\nFor information about adjusting the frequency of status updates, see [Adjust the status update interval](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/mediaconvert/latest/ug/adjusting-the-status-update-interval.html).\n\n**Automatically initiate post-processing with an AWS Lambda function**\nYou can set up EventBridge so that an AWS Lambda function initiates your post-processing code after your job finishes. For more information about using AWS Lambda with AWS Elemental MediaConvert, see one of these resources:\n\n- For experienced cloud architects, see the [Video on demand on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/video-on-demand-on-aws/) post on the _AWS_ _Answers_ blog.\n\n- For developers new to MediaConvert and Lambda, see the [Automating MediaConvert jobs with Lambda](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-media-services-simple-vod-workflow/blob/master/7-MediaConvertJobLambda/README.md) tutorial on GitHub.\n\n**Get details about jobs you create or other MediaConvert operations**\nBy default, MediaConvert does not emit an EventBridge event for new jobs that you create or any other MediaConvert operation that you perform. To receive EventBridge events in these cases, you first must create an AWS CloudTrail trail.\n\nFor more information, see [Working with CloudTrail trails](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-getting-started.html).\n\n###### Note\nEventBridge delivers each event from the MediaConvert event stream at least once.\nMediaConvert does not require any additional permissions to deliver events to EventBridge.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/mediaconvert/latest/ug/eventbridge_events.html", "title": "Using EventBridge with AWS Elemental MediaConvert", "description": "This page covers how to use Amazon EventBridge to monitor AWS Elemental MediaConvert jobs, including setting up notifications and tracking job progress.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 4, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 20:50:34", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"guide": "User Guide", "default_state": "eventbridge_events", "title": "Using EventBridge with AWS Elemental MediaConvert - MediaConvert", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "deployment_region": "IAD", "rss": "mediaconvert-documentatation-updates.rss", "forums": "https://repost.aws/tags/TAvef0yTvSQLGLbns8aVsMAg", "feedback": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forms/aws-doc-feedback?hidden_service_name=MediaConvert&topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/mediaconvert/latest/ug/eventbridge_events.html", "this_doc_guide": "User Guide", "language": "en-US", "abstract": "Use MediaConvert to format and compress offline video content for delivery to televisions or connected devices.

The AWS CLI provides direct access to the APIs for AWS services, such as Amazon RDS. For syntax and examples for the commands for Amazon RDS, see [rds](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/) in the _AWS CLI Command_ _Reference_.\n\n**AWS CloudFormation**\nWith this AWS Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool, you can create templates that describe all of the Amazon RDS resources that you want, and AWS CloudFormation provisions and configures those resources for you. For more information, see [Creating Amazon RDS resources with AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/creating-resources-with-cloudformation.html).\n\n**AWS software development kits (SDKs)**\nAWS provides SDKs for many popular technologies and programming languages. They make it easier for you to call AWS services from within your applications in that language or technology. For more information about these SDKs, see [Tools for developing and managing applications on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/tools/).\n\n**Amazon RDS API**\nThis API is the protocol-level interface for Amazon RDS. When using this API, you must format every HTTPS request correctly and add a valid digital signature to every request. For more information, see [Amazon RDS API reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/ProgrammingGuide.html).\n\n**Console-to-Code**\nWith this tool, you can generate code for actions that you perform in the Amazon RDS console, and use that code in other tools such as AWS CloudFormation.

You may review and change your choices at any time by selecting Cookie preferences in the footer of this site. We and selected third-parties use cookies or similar technologies as specified in the AWS Cookie Notice.\n\n## Unable to save cookie preferences\nWe will only store essential cookies at this time, because we were unable to save your cookie preferences.\n\nIf you want to change your cookie preferences, try again later using the link in the AWS console footer, or contact support if the problem persists.\n\n## To create an AWS Direct Connect hosted connection\nTo create an AWS Direct Connect hosted connection, you need the following information:\n\n**AWS Direct Connect location**\nWork with an AWS Direct Connect Partner in the AWS Direct Connect Partner Program to help you establish network circuits between an AWS Direct Connect location and your data center, office, or colocation environment. They can also help provide colocation space within the same facility as the location. For more information, see AWS Direct Connect Delivery Partners.\n\n**Port speed**\nFor hosted connections, the possible values are 50 Mbps, 100 Mbps, 200 Mbps, 300 Mbps, 400 Mbps, 500 Mbps, 1 Gbps, 2 Gbps, 5 Gbps, 10 Gbps, and 25 Gbps. Note that only those AWS Direct Connect partners who have met specific requirements may create a 1 Gbps, 2 Gbps, 5 Gbps, 10 Gbps, or 25 Gbps hosted connection. 25 Gbps connections are available only in Direct Connect locations where 100 Gbps port speeds are available.\n\nNote the following:\n- Connection port speeds can only be changed by your AWS Direct Connect Partner. Please check with your AWS Direct Connect Partner to see if they support upgrade or downgrade of an existing connection. If your Partner supports upgrade/downgrade of your connection, you are no longer required to delete and then recreate a connection in order to upgrade or downgrade an existing hosted connection's bandwidth.\n- AWS uses traffic policing on hosted connections, which means that when the traffic rate reaches the configured maximum rate, excess traffic is dropped. This might result in bursty traffic having a lower throughput than non-bursty traffic.\n- Jumbo frames can be enabled on connections only if originally enabled on the AWS Direct Connect hosted parent connection. If Jumbo frames isn't enabled on that parent connection, then it can't be enabled on any connection.\n\n## Console operations after requesting a hosted connection\nThe following console operations are available after you've requested a hosted connection and accepted it:\n- Delete a connection\n- Update a connection\n- View connection details\n\nAfter you accept a connection, create a virtual interface to connect to public and private AWS resources.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/hosted_connection.html", "title": "Hosted AWS Direct Connect connections", "description": "This page provides information on how to create and manage hosted AWS Direct Connect connections, including cookie preferences and essential details for setting up connections.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 5, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 20:52:27", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"product": "AWS Direct Connect", "assets_root": "/assets", "deployment_region": "IAD", "favicon": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/assets/images/favicon.ico", "title": "Hosted AWS Direct Connect connections - AWS Direct Connect", "feedback": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forms/aws-doc-feedback?hidden_service_name=Direct%20Connect&topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/hosted_connection.html", "keywords": "Direct Connect,Direct Connect location,internal network,virtual interface connection,Manage Direct Connect connections, including view details, accepting hosted connections, and adding or deleting connections.,learn about Direct Connect hosted connections", "target_state": "hosted_connection", "feedback-yes": "feedbackyes.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/hosted_connection.html", "default_state": "hosted_connection", "abstract": "AWS Direct Connect links your internal network to an AWS Direct Connect location over fiber-optic cable.

When you create a DB cluster snapshot, you need to identify which DB cluster you are going to back up, and then give your DB cluster snapshot a name so you can restore from it later. The amount of time it takes to create a DB cluster snapshot varies with the size of your databases. Because the snapshot includes the entire storage volume, the size of files, such as temporary files, also affects the amount of time it takes to create the snapshot.\n\n###### Note\nYour DB cluster must be in the `available` state to take a DB cluster snapshot.\n\nUnlike automated backups, manual snapshots aren't subject to the backup retention period. Snapshots don't expire.\n\nFor very long-term backups, we recommend exporting snapshot data to Amazon S3. If the major version of your DB engine is no longer supported, you can't restore to that version from a snapshot. For more information, see Exporting DB cluster snapshot data to Amazon S3.\n\nYou can create a DB cluster snapshot using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the RDS API.\n\n## To create a DB cluster snapshot\n1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/\n2. In the navigation pane, choose **Snapshots**.\nThe **Manual snapshots** list appears.\n3. Choose **Take snapshot**.\nThe **Take DB snapshot** window appears.\n4. For **Snapshot type**, select **DB cluster**.\n5. Choose the **DB cluster** for which you want to take a snapshot.\n6. Enter the **Snapshot name**.\n7. Choose **Take snapshot**.\nThe **Manual snapshots** list appears, with the new DB cluster snapshot's status shown as `Creating`. After its status is `Available`, you can see its creation time.\n\n## AWS CLI\nWhen you create a DB cluster snapshot using the AWS CLI, you need to identify which DB cluster you are going to back up, and then give your DB cluster snapshot a name so you can restore from it later. You can do this by using the AWS CLI `create-db-cluster-snapshot` command with the following parameters:\n- `--db-cluster-identifier`\n- `--db-cluster-snapshot-identifier`\n\nIn this example, you create a DB cluster snapshot named `mydbclustersnapshot` for a DB cluster called `mydbcluster`.\n\nFor Linux, macOS, or Unix:\n```bash\naws rds create-db-cluster-snapshot \\\n    --db-cluster-identifier mydbcluster \\\n    --db-cluster-snapshot-identifier mydbclustersnapshot\n```\n\nFor Windows:\n```powershell\naws rds create-db-cluster-snapshot ^\n    --db-cluster-identifier mydbcluster ^\n    --db-cluster-snapshot-identifier mydbclustersnapshot\n```\n\n## RDS API\nWhen you create a DB cluster snapshot using the Amazon RDS API, you need to identify which DB cluster you are going to back up, and then give your DB cluster snapshot a name so you can restore from it later. You can do this by using the Amazon RDS API `CreateDBClusterSnapshot` command with the following parameters:\n- DBClusterIdentifier\n- DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_CreateSnapshotCluster.html", "title": "Creating a DB cluster snapshot", "description": "This page provides instructions on how to create a DB cluster snapshot in Amazon RDS, including using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, and RDS API.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 7, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 20:52:44", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"tocs": "toc-contents.json", "feedback": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forms/aws-doc-feedback?hidden_service_name=RDS&topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_CreateSnapshotCluster.html", "favicon": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/assets/images/favicon.ico", "feedback-item": "RDS", "feedback-no": "feedbackno.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_CreateSnapshotCluster.html", "forums": "https://repost.aws/tags/TAsibBK6ZeQYihN9as4S_psg", "default_state": "USER_CreateSnapshotCluster", "assets_root": "/assets", "description": "Create a DB cluster snapshot by identifying which DB cluster you are going to back up, and give that DB cluster snapshot a name.", "abstract": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) documentation for Amazon Aurora (Aurora).

Internet-related attributes such as _tag_ or _keyword_ often contain multiple values, which are easy to support through the Amazon SimpleDB data model and query language.\n\n###### Important\nEach attribute is considered individually against the comparison conditions defined in the predicate. Item names are selected if _any_ of the values match the predicate condition. To change this behavior, use the `every()` operator to return results where _every_ attribute matches the query expression.\n\nThis section shows queries on attributes with multiple values and their results.\n\n###### Note\nTo view the source data for the queries, see [Sample Query Data Set](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonSimpleDB/latest/DeveloperGuide/UsingSelectSampleDataset.html).\n\nThe following table shows some queries on attributes with multiple values, how they are interpreted, and the results they return from the sample dataset.\n\n| Select Expression | Description | Result |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `select * from mydomain where Rating = '4 stars' or Rating = '****'` | Retrieves all items with a 4 star (****) rating. The data set has this rating stored as both \"4 stars\" and \"****.\" Amazon SimpleDB returns items that have either or both. | 1579124585, 0802131786, B000T9886K |\n| `select * from mydomain where Keyword = 'Book' and Keyword = 'Hardcover'` | Retrieve all items that have the Keyword attribute as both \"Book\" and \"Hardcover.\" Based on the data set, you might be surprised that the result did not return the \"1579124585\" item. As described earlier, each value is evaluated individually against the predicate expression. Since neither of the values satisfies _both_ comparisons defined in the predicate, the item name is not selected. To get the desired results, you can use the `select * from mydomain where Keyword = 'Book' intersection Keyword = 'Hardcover'` expression. | <none> |\n| `select * from mydomain where every(keyword) in ('Book', 'Paperback')` | Retrieves all items where the only keyword is Book or Paperback. If the item contains any other keyword entries, it is not returned. | 0385333498, 0802131786 |\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonSimpleDB/latest/DeveloperGuide/RangeValueQueriesSelect.html", "title": "Queries on Attributes with Multiple Values - Amazon SimpleDB", "description": "This page covers how to perform queries on attributes with multiple values in Amazon SimpleDB, including examples and explanations of the query results.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 4, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 20:52:57", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"feedback-yes": "feedbackyes.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonSimpleDB/latest/DeveloperGuide/RangeValueQueriesSelect.html", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "default_state": "RangeValueQueriesSelect", "product": "Amazon SimpleDB", "feedback-no": "feedbackno.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonSimpleDB/latest/DeveloperGuide/RangeValueQueriesSelect.html", "assets_root": "/assets", "title": "Queries on Attributes with Multiple Values - Amazon SimpleDB", "abstract": "Amazon SimpleDB is a highly available, scalable, and flexible non-relational data store that enables you to store and query data items using web services requests.

For Amazon RDS pricing information, see the Amazon RDS product page.\n\nBilling starts for a DB instance as soon as the DB instance is available. Pricing is listed on a per-hour basis, but bills are calculated down to the second and show times in decimal form. Amazon RDS usage is billed in one-second increments, with a minimum of 10 minutes. In the case of billable configuration change, such as scaling compute or storage capacity, you're charged a 10-minute minimum. Billing continues until the DB instance terminates, which occurs when you delete the DB instance or if the DB instance fails.\n\nIf you no longer want to be charged for your DB instance, you must stop or delete it to avoid being billed for additional DB instance hours. For more information about the DB instance states for which you are billed, see Viewing DB instance status in an Aurora cluster.\n\n## Stopped DB instances\nWhile your DB instance is stopped, you're charged for provisioned storage, including Provisioned IOPS. You are also charged for backup storage, including storage for manual snapshots and automated backups within your specified retention window. You aren't charged for DB instance hours.\n\n## Multi-AZ DB instances\nA Multi-AZ setup enhances data durability and availability by automatically provisioning and maintaining a synchronous standby replica in a different Availability Zone. Due to the additional resources and increased availability, Multi-AZ deployments are priced higher than Single-AZ deployments, and can cost approximately twice as much due to the additional standby instance and associated resources.\n\nConsider the following important details about Multi-AZ pricing:\n\n- **Compute costs**: Billed per DB instance-hour for both the primary and standby instances.\n- **Storage costs**: Charged per GB-month for the storage provisioned for both the primary and standby instances.\n- **Data transfer costs**: Replication between the primary and standby instances is included in the cost, but other data transfer charges might apply based on your usage.\n\nTo accurately estimate your monthly costs based on your specific use case and AWS Region, you can use the AWS Pricing Calculator. This tool lets you to input your configuration details and provides a comprehensive cost breakdown.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_OnDemandDBInstances.html", "title": "On-Demand DB instances for Aurora", "description": "Amazon RDS on-demand DB instances are billed based on the class of the DB instance and provide information on pricing, billing, and instance management.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 6, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 20:53:12", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"language": "en-US", "guide-locale": "en_us", "this_doc_product": "Amazon Aurora", "forums": "https://repost.aws/tags/TAsibBK6ZeQYihN9as4S_psg", "favicon": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/assets/images/favicon.ico", "tocs": "toc-contents.json", "assets_root": "/assets", "default_state": "USER_OnDemandDBInstances", "title": "On-Demand DB instances for Aurora - Amazon Aurora", "abstract": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) documentation for Amazon Aurora (Aurora).

Sign in to the [AWS Organizations console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/organizations/v2). You must sign in as an IAM user, assume an IAM role, or sign in as the root user ( [not recommended](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#lock-away-credentials)) in the organization’s management account.\n\n2. Navigate to the **[Settings](https://console.aws.amazon.com/organizations/v2/home/settings)** page. This page displays details about the organization, including the organization ID and the account name and email address assigned to the organization's management account.\n\n## AWS CLI & AWS SDKs\nYou can use one of the following commands to view details of an organization:\n\n- AWS CLI: [describe-organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/organizations/describe-organization.html)\n\nThe following example shows the information included in the output of this command.\n\n```bash\n$ aws organizations describe-organization\n{\n      \"Organization\": {\n          \"Id\": \"o-aa111bb222\",\n          \"Arn\": \"arn:aws:organizations::123456789012:organization/o-aa111bb222\",\n          \"FeatureSet\": \"ALL\",\n          \"MasterAccountArn\": \"arn:aws:organizations::128716708097:account/o-aa111bb222/123456789012\",\n          \"MasterAccountId\": \"123456789012\",\n          \"MasterAccountEmail\": \"admin@example.com\",\n          \"AvailablePolicyTypes\": [ ...DEPRECATED - DO NOT USE... ]\n      }\n}\n```\n\nThe `AvailablePolicyTypes` field is deprecated and doesn't contain accurate information about the policies enabled in your organization. To see the accurate and complete list of policy types that are actually enabled for the organization, use the `ListRoots` command, as described in the AWS CLI portion of the following section.\n\n- AWS SDKs: [DescribeOrganization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeOrganization.html)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_view_org.html", "title": "Viewing details of an organization from the management account", "description": "This page provides information on how to view details of an organization from the management account in AWS Organizations.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 6, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 20:53:24", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"feedback": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forms/aws-doc-feedback?hidden_service_name=Organizations&topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_view_org.html", "guide": "User Guide", "language": "en-US", "feedback-item": "Organizations", "deployment_region": "IAD", "this_doc_product": "AWS Organizations", "feedback-yes": "feedbackyes.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_view_org.html", "feedback-no": "feedbackno.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_view_org.html", "favicon": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/assets/images/favicon.ico", "tocs": "toc-contents.json", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "default_state": "orgs_view_org", "product": "AWS Organizations", "guide-locale": "en_us", "forums": "https://repost.aws/tags/TA6BEgyePwRAKiMatMcHghcA", "keywords": "organization,management account,member account,consolidated billing,consolidated billing family,organizational unit,OU,root,service control policy,invite account,create organization", "this_doc_guide": "User Guide", "description": "When you sign in to the organization's management account in the AWS Organizations console , you can view details of the organization.", "title": "Viewing details of an organization from the management account - AWS Organizations", "target_state": "orgs_view_org", "assets_root": "/assets", "pdf": "/pdfs/organizations/latest/userguide/organizations-userguide.pdf#orgs_view_org", "abstract": "Combine all of your AWS accounts into an organization to consolidate billing and to achieve new levels of control over your AWS accounts.", "rss": "aws-organizations-release-notes.rss", "scrapeId": "bff346db-776b-4fce-8858-11895964cd7e", "sourceURL": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_view_org.html", "url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_view_org.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

As an AWS customer, you benefit from a data center and network architecture that is built to meet the requirements of the most security-sensitive organizations.\n\nThis section provides standard AWS security guidance for your use of the AWS WAF service and its AWS resources, such as AWS WAF web ACLs and rule groups.\n\nSecurity is a shared responsibility between AWS and you. The shared responsibility model describes this as security of the cloud and security in the cloud:\n\n- **Security of the cloud** – AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs AWS services in the AWS Cloud. AWS also provides you with services that you can use securely. The effectiveness of our security is regularly tested and verified by third-party auditors as part of the AWS compliance programs. To learn about the compliance programs that apply to AWS WAF, see AWS Services in Scope by Compliance Program.\n\n- **Security in the cloud** – Your responsibility is determined by the AWS service that you use. You are also responsible for other factors including the sensitivity of your data, your organization’s requirements, and applicable laws and regulations.\n\nThis documentation helps you understand how to apply the shared responsibility model when using AWS WAF. The following topics show you how to configure AWS WAF to meet your security and compliance objectives. You also learn how to use other AWS services that help you to monitor and secure your AWS WAF resources.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/waf/latest/developerguide/security.html", "title": "Security in your use of the AWS WAF service", "description": "This section explains how the shared responsibility model applies to AWS WAF and provides guidance on securing AWS resources using AWS WAF.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 4, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 20:53:38", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"feedback": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forms/aws-doc-feedback?hidden_service_name=AWS%20WAF&topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/waf/latest/developerguide/security.html", "tocs": "toc-contents.json", "deployment_region": "IAD", "language": "en-US", "product": "AWS WAF, AWS Firewall Manager, and AWS Shield Advanced", "guide-locale": "en_us", "abstract": "Describes how to get started with AWS WAF and AWS Firewall Manager, the AWS web application firewall services, and Shield Advanced, which provides expanded DDoS attack protection.", "title": "Security in your use of the AWS WAF service - AWS WAF, AWS Firewall Manager, and AWS Shield Advanced", "feedback-item": "AWS WAF", "this_doc_product": "AWS WAF, AWS Firewall Manager, and AWS Shield Advanced", "guide": "Developer Guide", "feedback-yes": "feedbackyes.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/waf/latest/developerguide/security.html", "keywords": "AWS Firewall Manager,Firewall Manager,AWS WAF,web application firewall,firewall,ACL,access control list", "feedback-no": "feedbackno.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/waf/latest/developerguide/security.html", "favicon": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/assets/images/favicon.ico", "this_doc_guide": "Developer Guide", "assets_root": "/assets", "default_state": "security", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "target_state": "security", "pdf": "/pdfs/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-dg.pdf#security", "description": "Configure AWS WAF to meet your security and compliance objectives, and learn how to use other AWS services that help you to secure your AWS WAF resources.", "rss": "aws-waf-doc-history.rss", "forums": "https://repost.aws/tags/TAKdJ093DSSdGOQ1VVKX4EvQ", "scrapeId": "144750df-9548-4d3d-8028-2dac24605568", "sourceURL": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/waf/latest/developerguide/security.html", "url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/waf/latest/developerguide/security.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

As a result, organization administrators can easily view accounts and filter by status: `ACTIVE`, `SUSPENDED`, or `PENDING`. If your organization has many accounts, the .csv file download option provides an easy way to view and sort account details in a spreadsheet.\n\n###### Note\nOnly principals in the management account can download the account list.\n\n## Export a list of all AWS accounts in your organization\nWhen you sign in to the organization's management account, you can get a list of all accounts that are part of your organization as a .csv file. The list contains individual account details; however, it doesn't specify to which organizational unit (OU) the account belongs.\n\nThe .csv file contains the following information for each account:\n\n- **Account ID** - Numeric account identifier. For example: 123456789012\n- **ARN** - Amazon Resource Name for the account. For example: `arn:aws:organizations::123456789012:account/o-o1gb0d1234/123456789012`\n- **Email** - Email address associated with the account. For example: marymajor@example.com\n- **Name** - Account name provided by account creator. For example: stage testing account\n- **Status** - Account status within the organization. Value can be `PENDING`, `ACTIVE` or `SUSPENDED`.\n- **Joined method** - Specifies how the account was created. Value can be `INVITED` or `CREATED`.\n- **Joined timestamp** - Date and time the account joined the organization.\n\n###### Minimum permissions\nTo export a .csv file with all member accounts in your organization, you must have the following permissions:\n- `organizations:DescribeOrganization`\n- `organizations:ListAccounts`\n\n## AWS Management Console\n###### To export a .csv file for all AWS accounts in your organization\n\n1. Sign in to the [AWS Organizations console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/organizations/v2). You must sign in as an IAM user, assume an IAM role, or sign in as the root user ( [not recommended](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#lock-away-credentials)) in the organization’s management account.\n2. Choose **Actions**, then for **AWS account** choose **Export account list**. The blue banner at the top of the page indicates \"Export is in progress!\"\n3. When the file is ready, the banner turns green and indicates: \"Download is ready!\" Choose **Download CSV**.

For more information, see AWS Site-to-Site VPN tunnel authentication options.\n\nTo change the IKE pre-shared key, you can modify the tunnel options for the VPN connection and specify a new IKE pre-shared key for each tunnel. Alternatively, you can delete the VPN connection and create a new one using the same virtual private gateway, configuring the new keys on your customer gateway device.\n\nTo change the certificate for the AWS side of the tunnel endpoint, rotate the certificate.

If an item wasn't present during the latest training, it receives a score of 0.\n\nMathematically, the scoring function for GetPersonalizedRanking is identical to GetRecommendations, except that it only considers the input items. This means that scores closer to 1 become more likely, as there are fewer other choices to divide up the score.\n\n## Personalized-Ranking sample notebook\nFor a sample Jupyter notebook that shows how to use the Personalized-Ranking recipe see Personalize Ranking Example.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/personalize/latest/dg/rankings.html", "title": "Getting a personalized ranking (custom resources)", "description": "A personalized ranking is a list of recommended items that are re-ranked for a specific user.

The endpoint automatically detects and abstracts the routers. You don't have to specify individual routers for connection.\n\nYou can use `psql` or any other connection utility that works with PostgreSQL:\n\n```nohighlight hljs\n\n$ psql -h DB_cluster_endpoint -p port_number -U database_username -d postgres_limitless\n```\n\nThe following example uses the endpoint for the DB cluster that you created in [CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/limitless-create-cluster.html#limitless-create-CLI).\n\n```nohighlight hljs\n\n$ psql -h my-limitless-cluster.cluster-ckifpdyyyxxx.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -p 5432 -U postgres -d postgres_limitless\n```\n\n###### Note\n\nThe default database for the DB shard group in Aurora PostgreSQL Limitless Database is `postgres_limitless`.\n\n## Using the Limitless Connection Plugin\nWhen connecting to Aurora PostgreSQL Limitless Database, clients connect using the cluster endpoint, and are routed to a transaction router by Amazon Route 53. However, Route 53 is limited in its ability to load balance, and can allow uneven workloads on transaction routers. The [Limitless Connection Plugin](https://github.com/aws/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper/blob/main/docs/using-the-jdbc-driver/using-plugins/UsingTheLimitlessConnectionPlugin.md) for the [AWS JDBC Driver](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper) addresses this by performing client-side load balancing with load awareness. For more information on the [AWS JDBC Driver](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper), see [Connecting to Aurora PostgreSQL with the Amazon Web Services (AWS) JDBC Driver](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Connecting.html#Aurora.Connecting.JDBCDriverPostgreSQL).\n\n## Finding the number of routers and shards in a DB shard group\nYou can use the following query to find the number of routers and shards:\n\n```nohighlight hljs\n\nSELECT * FROM rds_aurora.limitless_subclusters;\n\n subcluster_id | subcluster_type\n---------------+-----------------\n 1             | router\n 2             | router\n 3             | shard\n 4             | shard\n 5             | shard\n 6             | shard\n```\n\n\n## Describing DB shard groups\nUse the `describe-db-shard-groups` AWS CLI command to describe your DB shard groups. The following parameter is optional:\n\n- `--db-shard-group-identifier` – The name of a DB shard group.\n\nThe following example describes a specific DB shard group.\n\n```nohighlight hljs\n\naws rds describe-db-shard-groups --db-shard-group-identifier my-db-shard-group\n```\n\nThe output resembles the following example.\n\n```nohighlight hljs\n\n{\n    \"DBShardGroups\": [\\\n        {\\\n            \"DBShardGroupResourceId\": \"shardgroup-8986d309a93c4da1b1455add17abcdef\",\\\n            \"DBShardGroupIdentifier\": \"my-shard-group\",\\\n            \"DBClusterIdentifier\": \"my-limitless-cluster\",\\\n            \"MaxACU\": 1000.0,\\\n            \"ComputeRedundancy\": 0,\\\n            \"Status\": \"available\",\\\n            \"PubliclyAccessible\": false,\\\n            \"Endpoint\": \"my-limitless-cluster.limitless-ccetp2abcdef.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com\"\\\n        }\\\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n## Rebooting a DB shard group\nSometimes you have to reboot your DB shard group, for example when the `max_connections` parameter changes because of a maximum capacity change.\n\nYou can use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to change the capacity of a DB shard group.\n\nUse the following procedure.\n\nSign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon RDS console at\n[https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/).\n\n1. Navigate to the **Databases** page.\n\n2. Select the DB shard group that you want to reboot.\n\n3. For **Actions**, choose **Reboot**.\n\n4. Choose **Confirm**.\n\n## CLI\nTo reboot a DB shard group, use the `reboot-db-shard-group` AWS CLI command with the following parameter:\n\n- `--db-shard-group-identifier` – The name of a DB shard group.\n\nThe following example reboots a DB shard group.\n\n```nohighlight hljs\n\naws rds reboot-db-shard-group --db-shard-group-identifier my-db-shard-group\n```\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/limitless-shard.html", "title": "Working with DB shard groups - Amazon Aurora", "description": "You perform the following tasks to add and manage a DB shard group for Aurora PostgreSQL Limitless Database.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 9, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 21:03:54", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"rss": "auroraupdates.rss", "feedback": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forms/aws-doc-feedback?hidden_service_name=RDS&topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/limitless-shard.html", "feedback-yes": "feedbackyes.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/limitless-shard.html", "pdf": "/pdfs/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-ug.pdf#limitless-shard", "feedback-no": "feedbackno.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/limitless-shard.html", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "feedback-item": "RDS", "language": "en-US", "keywords": "Amazon Relational Database Service,RDS,DB instance,Amazon Aurora,Aurora", "product": "Amazon Aurora", "guide-locale": "en_us", "assets_root": "/assets", "description": "Learn how to work with DB shard groups.", "deployment_region": "IAD", "abstract": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) documentation for Amazon Aurora (Aurora).

Such resources include DB clusters, security groups, and parameter groups. Also use IAM to control actions that perform common administrative actions such as backing up and restoring DB clusters.\n\n- Create an individual user for each person who manages Amazon Aurora resources, including yourself. Don't use AWS root credentials to manage Amazon Aurora resources.\n\n- Grant each user the minimum set of permissions required to perform his or her duties.\n\n- Use IAM groups to effectively manage permissions for multiple users.\n\n- Rotate your IAM credentials regularly.\n\n- Configure AWS Secrets Manager to automatically rotate the secrets for Amazon Aurora. For more information, see Rotating your AWS Secrets Manager secrets in the AWS Secrets Manager User Guide. You can also retrieve the credential from AWS Secrets Manager programmatically. For more information, see Retrieving the secret value in the AWS Secrets Manager User Guide.\n\nFor more information about Amazon Aurora security, see Security in Amazon Aurora. For more information about IAM, see AWS Identity and Access Management. For information on IAM best practices, see IAM best practices.\n\nAWS Security Hub uses security controls to evaluate resource configurations and security standards to help you comply with various compliance frameworks. For more information about using Security Hub to evaluate RDS resources, see Amazon Relational Database Service controls in the AWS Security Hub User Guide.\n\nYou can monitor your usage of RDS as it relates to security best practices by using Security Hub. For more information, see What is AWS Security Hub?.\n\nUse the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the RDS API to change the password for your master user. If you use another tool, such as a SQL client, to change the master user password, it might result in privileges being revoked for the user unintentionally.\n\nAmazon GuardDuty is a continuous security monitoring service that analyzes and processes various data sources, including Amazon RDS login activity. It uses threat intelligence feeds and machine learning to identify unexpected, potentially unauthorized, suspicious login behavior, and malicious activity within your AWS environment.\n\nWhen Amazon GuardDuty RDS Protection detects a potentially suspicious or anomalous login attempt that indicates a threat to your database, GuardDuty generates a new finding with details about the potentially compromised database.

It is a no-code way to create a GraphQL resolver for GraphQL queries that have a variable number of input parameters and return a variable number of nested fields.\n\n- **[Nodestream](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/neptune/latest/userguide/tools-Nodestream.html)**   – Nodestream is a framework for dealing with semantically modeling data as a graph. It is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing you to define how data is collected and modeled as a graph. It uses a pipeline-based approach to define how data is collected and processed, and it provides a way to define how the graph should be updated when the schema changes.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/neptune/latest/userguide/tools.html", "title": "Neptune tools and utilities", "description": "Amazon Neptune provides a number of tools and utilities that can simplify and automate your work with a graph.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 4, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 21:05:05", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"tocs": "toc-contents.json", "language": "en-US", "feedback-item": "Neptune", "this_doc_guide": "User Guide", "favicon": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/assets/images/favicon.ico", "title": "Neptune tools and utilities - Amazon Neptune", "default_state": "tools", "this_doc_product": "Amazon Neptune", "pdf": "/pdfs/neptune/latest/userguide/neptune-ug.pdf#tools", "feedback-yes": "feedbackyes.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/neptune/latest/userguide/tools.html", "description": "Tools and utilities that can simplify and automate working with Neptune.", "feedback": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forms/aws-doc-feedback?hidden_service_name=Neptune&topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/neptune/latest/userguide/tools.html", "feedback-no": "feedbackno.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/neptune/latest/userguide/tools.html", "guide-locale": "en_us", "assets_root": "/assets", "abstract": "Amazon Neptune is a fast, reliable, fully managed graph database service that makes it easy to build and run applications that work with highly connected datasets.", "guide": "User Guide", "product": "Amazon Neptune", "deployment_region": "IAD", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "rss": "rssupdates.rss", "keywords": "Neptune Graph database,Amazon Neptune Graph database,Graph,Graph database,Database,SPARQL,Gremlin,Cypher,openCypher,Neptune tools,Neptune utilities", "forums": "https://repost.aws/tags/TAxVAEdWg1SrS0lClUSX-m_Q", "target_state": "tools", "scrapeId": "c0dad76d-595b-4bf6-91be-baefdf1e46f1", "sourceURL": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/neptune/latest/userguide/tools.html", "url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/neptune/latest/userguide/tools.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

From Kinesis, you can monitor your database activity in real time. To further analyze database activity, you can connect your Kinesis stream to consumer applications. You can also connect the stream to compliance management applications such as IBM's Security Guardium or Imperva's SecureSphere Database Audit and Protection.\n\nYou can access your Kinesis stream either from the RDS console or the Kinesis console.\n\n###### To access an activity stream from Kinesis using the RDS console\n1. Open the Amazon RDS console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/.\n2. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**.\n3. Choose the DB cluster on which you started an activity stream.\n4. Choose **Configuration**.\n5. Under **Database activity stream**, choose the link under **Kinesis stream**.\n6. In the Kinesis console, choose **Monitoring** to begin observing the database activity.\n\n###### To access an activity stream from Kinesis using the Kinesis console\n1. Open the Kinesis console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/kinesis.\n2. Choose your activity stream from the list of Kinesis streams.\n\nAn activity stream's name includes the prefix `aws-rds-das-cluster-` followed by the resource ID of the DB cluster. The following is an example.\n\n```nohighlight hljs\naws-rds-das-cluster-NHVOV4PCLWHGF52NP\n```\n\nTo use the Amazon RDS console to find the resource ID for the DB cluster, choose your DB cluster from the list of databases, and then choose the **Configuration** tab.\n\nTo use the AWS CLI to find the full Kinesis stream name for an activity stream, use a [describe-db-clusters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/describe-db-clusters.html) CLI request and note the value of `ActivityStreamKinesisStreamName` in the response.\n\n3. Choose **Monitoring** to begin observing the database activity.\n\nFor more information about using Amazon Kinesis, see [What Is Amazon Kinesis Data Streams?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/introduction.html).\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/DBActivityStreams.KinesisAccess.html", "title": "Accessing an activity stream from Amazon Kinesis", "description": "This page provides information on how to enable and access an activity stream for a DB cluster using Amazon Kinesis.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 4, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 21:05:22", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"favicon": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/assets/images/favicon.ico", "this_doc_guide": "User Guide for Aurora", "pdf": "/pdfs/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-ug.pdf#DBActivityStreams.KinesisAccess", "product": "Amazon Aurora", "tocs": "toc-contents.json", "rss": "auroraupdates.rss", "forums": "https://repost.aws/tags/TAsibBK6ZeQYihN9as4S_psg", "description": "Access an activity stream to monitor your database activity in real time with Amazon Kinesis.", "guide": "User Guide for Aurora", "title": "Accessing an activity stream from Amazon Kinesis - Amazon Aurora", "abstract": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) documentation for Amazon Aurora (Aurora).

This database is where you actually create tables, load data, and run queries. A data warehouse can host multiple databases. For example, you can have a database for sales data named SALESDB and a database for orders data named ORDERSDB in the same data warehouse.\n\nTo create a database named SALESDB, run the following command in your SQL client tool.\n\n```sql\nCREATE DATABASE salesdb;\n```\n\n###### Note\nAfter running the command, make sure to refresh your SQL client tool list of objects in your data warehouse to see the new salesdb.\n\nFor this exercise, accept the defaults.

Each topic has one or more subscribers who receive the messages that have been published to that topic. Using the steps below you can add AWS Directory Service as publisher to an Amazon SNS topic. When AWS Directory Service detects a change in your directory’s status, it publishes a message to that topic, which is then sent to the topic's subscribers.\n\nYou can associate multiple directories as publishers to a single topic. You can also add directory status messages to topics that you’ve previously created in Amazon SNS. You have detailed control over who can publish to and subscribe to a topic. For complete information about Amazon SNS, see What is Amazon SNS?\n\n## To enable SNS messaging for your directory\n1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Directory Service console.\n2. On the Directories page, choose your directory ID.\n3. Select the Maintenance tab.\n4. In the Directory monitoring section, choose Actions, and then select Create notification.\n5. On the Create notification page, select Choose a notification type, and then choose Create a new notification. Alternatively, if you already have an existing SNS topic, you can choose Associate existing SNS topic to send status messages from this directory to that topic.\n6. Choose the Recipient type and enter the Recipient contact information. If you enter a phone number for SMS, use numbers only. Do not include dashes, spaces, or parentheses.\n7. (Optional) Provide a name for your topic and an SNS display name. The display name is a short name up to 10 characters that is included in all SMS messages from this topic. When using the SMS option, the display name is required.\n8. Choose Create.\n\n## To remove directory status messages from a topic\n1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Directory Service console.\n2. On the Directories page, choose your directory ID.\n3. Select the Maintenance tab.\n4. In the Directory monitoring section, select an SNS topic name in the list, choose Actions, and then select Remove.\n5. Choose Remove.\n\nThis removes your directory as a publisher to the selected SNS topic. If you want to delete the entire topic, you can do this from the Amazon SNS console.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/ad_connector_enable_notifications.html", "title": "Enabling AD Connector directory status notifications with Amazon SNS", "description": "This page provides instructions on how to enable notifications for directory status changes using Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS).", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 6, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 21:08:31", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"feedback": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forms/aws-doc-feedback?hidden_service_name=DirectoryService&topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/ad_connector_enable_notifications.html", "default_state": "ad_connector_enable_notifications", "tocs": "toc-contents.json", "language": "en-US", "rss": "aws-directory-service-admin-guide-doc-history.rss", "abstract": "AWS Directory Service is a directory as a service that provides the capabilities of an enterprise directory with the accessibility and security of the AWS cloud.", "feedback-no": "feedbackno.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/ad_connector_enable_notifications.html", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "guide-locale": "en_us", "assets_root": "/assets", "this_doc_guide": "Administration Guide", "this_doc_product": "AWS Directory Service", "description": "Learn how to configure Amazon SNS for AD Connector.", "deployment_region": "IAD", "feedback-item": "DirectoryService", "forums": "https://repost.aws/tags/TAkGIL-2I9RYOFF_luDq9dMQ", "feedback-yes": "feedbackyes.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/ad_connector_enable_notifications.html", "keywords": "Directory Services,AWS Directory Service,Active Directory,AD Connector,Simple AD,Trust Relationship,Learn more about AD Connector,Learn about AD Connector features and capabilities,Benefits of AD Connector,Monitor AD Connector status,Amazon Simple Notification Service for AD Connector", "favicon": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/assets/images/favicon.ico", "product": "AWS Directory Service", "guide": "Administration Guide", "title": "Enabling AD Connector directory status notifications with Amazon SNS - AWS Directory Service", "pdf": "/pdfs/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/directoryservice-admin-guide.pdf#ad_connector_enable_notifications", "target_state": "ad_connector_enable_notifications", "scrapeId": "d6a22afb-fefc-4548-a003-171c02b045e3", "sourceURL": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/ad_connector_enable_notifications.html", "url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/ad_connector_enable_notifications.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

You can use the Docker CLI, or your preferred client, to push and pull images to and from your repositories. For each upstream registry containing images you want to cache in your Amazon ECR private registry, you must create a pull through cache rule. For upstream registries that require authentication, you must store the credentials in an Secrets Manager secret. You can create the Secrets Manager secret in either the Amazon ECR or Secrets Manager consoles.

Instance metadata is categories of information about instances. It includes categories such as _host name_, _events_, and _security groups_. Using IMDS for Snow, you can use instance metadata to access user data that you specified when launching your Amazon EC2-compatible instance. For example, you can use IMDS for Snow to specify parameters for configuring your instance, or include these parameters in a simple script. You can build generic AMIs and use user data to modify the configuration files supplied at launch time.\n\nTo learn about instance metadata and user data and Snow EC2-compatible instances, see [Supported Instance Metadata and User Data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/snowball/latest/developer-guide/edge-compute-instance-metadata.html) in this guide.\n\n## Important\nAlthough you can only access instance metadata and user data from within the instance itself, the data is not protected by authentication or cryptographic methods. Anyone who has direct access to the instance, and potentially any software running on the instance, can view its metadata. Therefore, you should not store sensitive data, such as passwords or long-lived encryption keys, as user data.\n\n## Note\nThe examples in this section use the IPv4 address of the instance metadata service: 169.254.169.254.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful AWS expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Logging and monitoring in Amazon Aurora\"?\n\nAssistant: Monitoring is an important part of maintaining the reliability, availability, and performance of Amazon Aurora and your AWS solutions. You should collect monitoring data from all of the parts of your AWS solution so that you can more easily debug a multi-point failure if one occurs.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Select your cookie preferences\nWe use essential cookies and similar tools that are necessary to provide our site and services. We use performance cookies to collect anonymous statistics, so we can understand how customers use our site and make improvements. Essential cookies cannot be deactivated, but you can choose “Customize” or “Decline” to decline performance cookies.\n\nIf you agree, AWS and approved third parties will also use cookies to provide useful site features, remember your preferences, and display relevant content, including relevant advertising. To accept or decline all non-essential cookies, choose “Accept” or “Decline.” To make more detailed choices, choose “Customize.”\n\nAcceptDeclineCustomize\n\n## Customize cookie preferences\nWe use cookies and similar tools (collectively, \"cookies\") for the following purposes.\n\n### Essential\nEssential cookies are necessary to provide our site and services and cannot be deactivated. They are usually set in response to your actions on the site, such as setting your privacy preferences, signing in, or filling in forms.\n\n### Performance\nPerformance cookies provide anonymous statistics about how customers navigate our site so we can improve site experience and performance. Approved third parties may perform analytics on our behalf, but they cannot use the data for their own purposes.\n\nAllow performance category\n\nAllowed\n\n### Functional\nFunctional cookies help us provide useful site features, remember your preferences, and display relevant content.

If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less relevant advertising.\n\nAllow advertising category\n\nAllowed\n\nBlocking some types of cookies may impact your experience of our sites. You may review and change your choices at any time by selecting Cookie preferences in the footer of this site. We and selected third-parties use cookies or similar technologies as specified in the AWS Cookie Notice.\n\n## Unable to save cookie preferences\nWe will only store essential cookies at this time, because we were unable to save your cookie preferences.\n\nIf you want to change your cookie preferences, try again later using the link in the AWS console footer, or contact support if the problem persists.\n\n## Monitoring Tools\nAWS provides several tools for monitoring your Amazon Aurora resources and responding to potential incidents:\n\n**Amazon CloudWatch Alarms**\nUsing Amazon CloudWatch alarms, you watch a single metric over a time period that you specify. If the metric exceeds a given threshold, a notification is sent to an Amazon SNS topic or AWS Auto Scaling policy. CloudWatch alarms do not invoke actions because they are in a particular state. Rather the state must have changed and been maintained for a specified number of periods.\n\n**AWS CloudTrail Logs**\nCloudTrail provides a record of actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service in Amazon Aurora. CloudTrail captures all API calls for Amazon Aurora as events, including calls from the console and from code calls to Amazon RDS API operations. Using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine the request that was made to Amazon Aurora, the IP address from which the request was made, who made the request, when it was made, and additional details.\n\n**Enhanced Monitoring**\nAmazon Aurora provides metrics in real time for the operating system (OS) that your DB cluster runs on. You can view the metrics for your DB cluster using the console, or consume the Enhanced Monitoring JSON output from Amazon CloudWatch Logs in a monitoring system of your choice.\n\n**Amazon RDS Performance Insights**\nPerformance Insights expands on existing Amazon Aurora monitoring features to illustrate your database's performance and help you analyze any issues that affect it. With the Performance Insights dashboard, you can visualize the database load and filter the load by waits, SQL statements, hosts, or users.\n\n**Database Logs**\nYou can view, download, and watch database logs using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or RDS API.\n\n**Amazon Aurora Recommendations**\nAmazon Aurora provides automated recommendations for database resources. These recommendations provide best practice guidance by analyzing DB cluster configuration, usage, and performance data.\n\n**Amazon Aurora Event Notification**\nAmazon Aurora uses the Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to provide notification when an Amazon Aurora event occurs. These notifications can be in any notification form supported by Amazon SNS for an AWS Region, such as an email, a text message, or a call to an HTTP endpoint.\n\n**AWS Trusted Advisor**\nTrusted Advisor draws upon best practices learned from serving hundreds of thousands of AWS customers. Trusted Advisor inspects your AWS environment and then makes recommendations when opportunities exist to save money, improve system availability and performance, or help close security gaps. All AWS customers have access to five Trusted Advisor checks. Customers with a Business or Enterprise support plan can view all Trusted Advisor checks.\n\n**Database activity streams**\nDatabase activity streams can protect your databases from internal threats by controlling DBA access to the database activity streams. Thus, the collection, transmission, storage, and subsequent processing of the database activity stream is beyond the access of the DBAs that manage the database.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Overview.LoggingAndMonitoring.html", "title": "Logging and monitoring in Amazon Aurora", "description": "Monitoring is an important part of maintaining the reliability, availability, and performance of Amazon Aurora and your AWS solutions.

The actions you create become part of the functionality of each visual or insight.\n\nThe following table defines when to use each type of action.\n\n| Action to perform | Type of action |\n| --- | --- |\n| Add or customize an interactive filter action, including one-click filters | Filter action |\n| Open another sheet in the same dashboard | Navigation action |\n| Open a sheet in a different dashboard in the same AWS account | URL action |\n| Open a URL ( `https`, `http`) | URL action |\n| Send an email ( `mailto`) | URL action |\n\nYou can set the following attributes and options for a custom action:\n\n- **Action name** – This is a descriptive name that you choose for the action. By default, actions are named `Action 1`, `Action 2`, and so on. If your custom action is activated from a context menu, this name displays in the menu when you right-click on a data point.\n\nTo make the action name dynamic, you can parameterize it. Use the plus sign icon near the action name header to display a list of available variables. Variables are enclosed in angle brackets `<< >>`. Parameters are prefixed with a `$`, for example `<<$parameterName>>`. Field names have no prefix, for example `<<fieldName>>`.\n\n- **Activation** – Available options are **Select** or **Menu** option. To use an action, you can select the data point (left-click) or navigate to the menu option in the context menu (right-click). Navigation actions and URL actions listed in the middle of the context menu, just above **Color** options. Actions that are activated by menu are also available from the legend on a visual.\n\n- **Action type** – The type of action that you want. Settings that are specific to an action type only display after you choose the action type.\n\n- **Filter action** settings include the following:\n\n- **Filter scope** – The fields to filter on. To filter on all fields, choose **All fields**. Otherwise, choose **Select fields** and then turn off the items you don't want to target.\n\nThe default is **All fields**.\n\n- **Target visuals** – The dashboard widgets to target. To apply the filter to all of them, choose **All visuals**. Otherwise, choose **Select visuals** and then turn off the items you don't want to target. When you apply a filter action to other visuals, the effect is called cascading filters.\n\nThe default is **All visuals**.\n\nA cascading filter applies all the visuals that are set up in the **Target visuals** section of a specific filter action. Amazon QuickSight initially evaluates your visuals and preconfigures the settings for you. But you can change the defaults if you wish to do so. You can set up multiple cascading filters on multiple visuals in the same sheet or analysis. When you are using the analysis or dashboard, you can use multiple cascading filters at the same time, although you activate each of these one at a time.\n\nA filter action requires at least one target visual, because a filter action requires a source and a target. To filter only the current visual, create a regular filter instead by choosing **Filter** at left.\n\n- **Navigation action** settings include the following:\n\n- **Target sheet** – The sheet to target.\n\n- **Parameters** – The parameters to send to the target sheet. Choose the plus sign icon to add an existing parameter.\n\n- **URL action** settings include the following:\n\n- **URL** – The URL to open. URL actions can be deep links into another application. Valid URL schemes include `https`, `http`, and `mailto`.\n\n- **(Values)** – (Optional) The parameters to send to the target URL. Parameter names start with a `$`. The parameters on both the sending and the receiving end must match in name and data type.\n\n- **Open in** – Where to open the URL. You can choose **New browser tab**, **Same browser tab**, or **New browser window**.\n\nSome types of actions enable you to include values from parameters or fields that are available in the visual or insight. You can type these in manually or choose the plus sign icon to select from a list. For the custom action to work, every field and parameter it references must be actively in use in the parent widget.\n\nUse the following procedure to create, view, or edit a custom action in an analysis.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/quicksight/latest/user/custom-actions.html", "title": "Creating and editing custom actions in Amazon QuickSight", "description": "This page provides guidance on how to create, view, and edit custom actions in Amazon QuickSight, including the types of actions available and their settings.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 4, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 21:13:13", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"keywords": "data analysis,data insights,data visualization,dataviz,graphical data analysis,Amazon QuickSight,actions in quicksight,quicksight actions,customized actions,custom actions,filter action,menu action,url actions,context menu,right click menu,add to menu,go to sheet", "tocs": "toc-contents.json", "guide-locale": "en_us", "target_state": "custom-actions", "feedback-yes": "feedbackyes.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/quicksight/latest/user/custom-actions.html", "deployment_region": "IAD", "description": "Learn to create and edit custom actions in Amazon QuickSight.", "rss": "amazon-quicksight-doc-release-notes.rss", "feedback-no": "feedbackno.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/quicksight/latest/user/custom-actions.html", "abstract": "The Amazon QuickSight user guide contains how-to topics, and guides for creating data analyses, visualizations, and dashboards.", "language": "en-US", "favicon": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/assets/images/favicon.ico", "title": "Creating and editing custom actions in Amazon QuickSight - Amazon QuickSight", "guide": "User Guide", "this_doc_product": "Amazon QuickSight", "assets_root": "/assets", "this_doc_guide": "User Guide", "pdf": "/pdfs/quicksight/latest/user/amazon-quicksight-user.pdf#custom-actions", "default_state": "custom-actions", "product": "Amazon QuickSight", "feedback": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forms/aws-doc-feedback?hidden_service_name=QuickSight&topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/quicksight/latest/user/custom-actions.html", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "forums": "https://repost.aws/tags/TAtoF6BGmuRdGfw2e14IBwEQ", "feedback-item": "QuickSight", "scrapeId": "7f6d25fd-d965-421b-b197-0f67a90afe7d", "sourceURL": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/quicksight/latest/user/custom-actions.html", "url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/quicksight/latest/user/custom-actions.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful AWS expert.\n\nUser: What is \"AWS Secrets and Configuration Provider code examples\"?\n\nAssistant: This page provides code examples and configurations for using the AWS Secrets and Configuration Provider with Amazon EKS.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Select your cookie preferences\nWe use essential cookies and similar tools that are necessary to provide our site and services.

You may review and change your choices at any time by selecting Cookie preferences in the footer of this site. We and selected third-parties use cookies or similar technologies as specified in the AWS Cookie Notice.\n\n## Unable to save cookie preferences\nWe will only store essential cookies at this time, because we were unable to save your cookie preferences.\n\nIf you want to change your cookie preferences, try again later using the link in the AWS console footer, or contact support if the problem persists.\n\n## ASCP authentication and access control examples\n### Example: IAM policy allowing Amazon EKS Pod Identity service (pods.eks.amazonaws.com) to assume the role and tag the session:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n  \"Statement\": [\n    {\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Principal\": {\n        \"Service\": \"pods.eks.amazonaws.com\"\n      },\n      \"Action\": [\n        \"sts:AssumeRole\",\n        \"sts:TagSession\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## SecretProviderClass\nYou use YAML to describe which secrets to mount in Amazon EKS using the ASCP. For examples, see SecretProviderClass usage.\n\n### SecretProviderClass YAML structure\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: secrets-store.csi.x-k8s.io/v1\nkind: SecretProviderClass\nmetadata:\n   name: name\nspec:\n  provider: aws\n  parameters:\n    region:\n    failoverRegion:\n    pathTranslation:\n    usePodIdentity:\n    preferredAddressType:\n    objects:\n```\n\nThe parameters field contains the details of the mount request:\n\n**region**\n(Optional) The AWS Region of the secret. If you don't use this field, the ASCP looks up the Region from the annotation on the node. This lookup adds overhead to mount requests, so we recommend that you provide the Region for clusters that use large numbers of Pods.\n\n**failoverRegion**\n(Optional) If you include this field, the ASCP tries to retrieve the secret from the Regions defined in `region` and this field. If either Region returns a 4xx error, for example for an authentication issue, the ASCP does not mount either secret. If the secret is retrieved successfully from `region`, then the ASCP mounts that secret value. If the secret is not retrieved successfully from `region`, but it is retrieved successfully from `failoverRegion`, then the ASCP mounts that secret value.\n\n**pathTranslation**\n(Optional) A single substitution character to use if the file name in Amazon EKS will contain the path separator character, such as slash (/) on Linux. The ASCP can't create a mounted file that contains a path separator character. Instead, the ASCP replaces the path separator character with a different character. If you don't use this field, the replacement character is underscore (_), so for example, `My/Path/Secret` mounts as `My_Path_Secret`.\n\nTo prevent character substitution, enter the string `False`.\n\n**usePodIdentity**\n(Optional) Determines the authentication approach. When not specified, it defaults to IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) (IRSA).\n\n- To use EKS Pod Identity, use any of these values: \"true\", \"True\", \"TRUE\", \"t\", or \"T\".\n\n- To explicitly use IRSA, set to any of these values: \"false\", \"False\", \"FALSE\", \"f\", or \"F\".\n\n**preferredAddressType**\n(Optional) Specifies the preferred IP address type for Pod Identity Agent endpoint communication. The field is only applicable when using EKS Pod Identity feature and will be ignored when using IAM Roles for Service Accounts. Values are case-insensitive. Valid values are:\n\n- \"ipv4\", \"IPv4\", or \"IPV4\" – Force the use of Pod Identity Agent IPv4 endpoint\n\n- \"ipv6\", \"IPv6\", or \"IPV6\" – Force the use of Pod Identity Agent IPv6 endpoint\n\n- not specified – Use auto endpoint selection, trying IPv4 endpoint first and falling back to IPv6 endpoint if IPv4 fails\n\n**objects**\nA string containing a YAML declaration of the secrets to be mounted. We recommend using a YAML multi-line string or pipe (|) character.\n\n## Create a basic SecretProviderClass configuration to mount secrets in your Amazon EKS Pods\nPod Identity\n\nSecretProviderClass to use a secret in the same Amazon EKS cluster:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: secrets-store.csi.x-k8s.io/v1\nkind: SecretProviderClass\nmetadata:\n  name: aws-secrets-manager\nspec:\n  provider: aws\n  parameters:\n    objects: |\n      -

objectName: \"MySecret\"\n          objectType: \"secretsmanager\"\n```\n\n## SecretProviderClass usage\nUse these examples to create SecretProviderClass configurations for different scenarios.\n\n#### Example: Mount secrets by name or ARN\nThis example shows how to mount three different types of secrets:\n\n- A secret specified by full ARN\n- A secret specified by name\n- A specific version of a secret\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: secrets-store.csi.x-k8s.io/v1\nkind: SecretProviderClass\nmetadata:\n  name: aws-secrets\nspec:\n  provider: aws\n  parameters:\n    objects: |\n      -

objectName: \"MySecret\"\n```\n\n## Failover to a different secret\nThis example shows how to configure failover to a different secret (not a replica):\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: secrets-store.csi.x-k8s.io/v1\nkind: SecretProviderClass\nmetadata:\n  name: aws-secrets\nspec:\n  provider: aws\n  parameters:\n    region: us-east-1\n    failoverRegion: us-east-2\n    objects: |\n      -

For example, if you aren't sure of the bitrate and you are trying to choose between 10 Mbps and 20 Mbps, then choose 20 Mbps, to be on the safe side.

You may review and change your choices at any time by selecting Cookie preferences in the footer of this site. We and selected third-parties use cookies or similar technologies as specified in the AWS Cookie Notice.\n\n## Unable to save cookie preferences\nWe will only store essential cookies at this time, because we were unable to save your cookie preferences.\n\nIf you want to change your cookie preferences, try again later using the link in the AWS console footer, or contact support if the problem persists.\n\n## To start a database activity stream\n1. Open the Amazon RDS console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/).\n\n2. In the navigation pane, choose **Databases**.\n\n3. Choose the DB cluster on which you want to start an activity stream.\n\n4. For **Actions**, choose **Start activity stream**.\n\nThe **Start database activity stream:** `name` window appears, where `name` is your DB cluster.\n\n5. Enter the following settings:\n\n- For **AWS KMS key**, choose a key from the list of AWS KMS keys.\n\n###### Note\nIf your Aurora MySQL cluster can't access KMS keys, follow the instructions in [Network prerequisites for Aurora MySQL database activity streams](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/DBActivityStreams.Prereqs.html) to enable such access first.\n\nAurora uses the KMS key to encrypt the key that in turn encrypts database activity. Choose a KMS key other than the default key. For more information about encryption keys and AWS KMS, see [What is AWS Key Management Service?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/overview.html) in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide._\n\n- For **Database activity stream mode**, choose **Asynchronous** or **Synchronous**.\n\n###### Note\nThis choice applies only to Aurora PostgreSQL. For Aurora MySQL, you can use only asynchronous mode.\n\n- Choose **Immediately**.\n\nWhen you choose **Immediately**, the DB cluster restarts right away. If you choose **During the next maintenance window**, the DB cluster doesn't restart right away. In this case, the database activity stream doesn't start until the next maintenance window.\n\n6. Choose **Start database activity stream**.\n\nThe status for the DB cluster shows that the activity stream is starting.\n\n###### Note\nIf you get the error `You can't start a database activity stream in this configuration`, check [Supported DB instance classes for database activity streams](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/DBActivityStreams.html#DBActivityStreams.Overview.requirements.classes) to see whether your DB cluster is using a supported instance class.\n\n## AWS CLI\nTo start database activity streams for a DB cluster, configure the DB cluster using the [start-activity-stream](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/start-activity-stream.html) AWS CLI command.\n\n- `--resource-arn arn` – Specifies the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the DB cluster.\n\n- `--mode sync-or-async` – Specifies either synchronous ( `sync`) or asynchronous ( `async`) mode. For Aurora PostgreSQL, you can choose either value. For Aurora MySQL, specify `async`.\n\n- `--kms-key-id key` – Specifies the KMS key identifier for encrypting messages in the database activity stream. The AWS KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the AWS KMS key.\n\nThe following example starts a database activity stream for a DB cluster in asynchronous mode.\n\nFor Linux, macOS, or Unix:\n\n```nohighlight hljs\naws rds start-activity-stream \\\n    --mode async \\\n    --kms-key-id my-kms-key-arn \\\n    --resource-arn my-cluster-arn \\\n    --apply-immediately\n```\n\nFor Windows:\n\n```nohighlight hljs\naws rds start-activity-stream ^\n    --mode async ^\n    --kms-key-id my-kms-key-arn ^\n    --resource-arn my-cluster-arn ^\n    --apply-immediately\n```\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/DBActivityStreams.Enabling.html", "title": "Starting a database activity stream", "description": "To monitor database activity for all instances in your Aurora DB cluster, start an activity stream at the cluster level.

You can find version 3 documentation here.\n\n## IAmazonGlacier.UploadArchive (UploadArchiveRequest)\nThis operation adds an archive to a vault. This is a synchronous operation, and for a successful upload, your data is durably persisted. Amazon Glacier returns the archive ID in the `x-amz-archive-id` header of the response.\n\nYou must use the archive ID to access your data in Amazon Glacier. After you upload an archive, you should save the archive ID returned so that you can retrieve or delete the archive later. Besides saving the archive ID, you can also index it and give it a friendly name to allow for better searching. You can also use the optional archive description field to specify how the archive is referred to in an external index of archives, such as you might create in Amazon DynamoDB. You can also get the vault inventory to obtain a list of archive IDs in a vault. For more information, see InitiateJob.\n\nYou must provide a SHA256 tree hash of the data you are uploading. For information about computing a SHA256 tree hash, see Computing Checksums.\n\nYou can optionally specify an archive description of up to 1,024 printable ASCII characters. You can get the archive description when you either retrieve the archive or get the vault inventory. For more information, see InitiateJob. Amazon Glacier does not interpret the description in any way. An archive description does not need to be unique. You cannot use the description to retrieve or sort the archive list.\n\nArchives are immutable. After you upload an archive, you cannot edit the archive or its description.\n\nAn AWS account has full permission to perform all operations (actions). However, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users don't have any permissions by default. You must grant them explicit permission to perform specific actions.

For details, refer to [Setting up for Service Catalog](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/latest/adminguide/setup.html) and [Using AppRegistry.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/latest/arguide/intro-app-registry.html)\n\n- **AWS Config details** — Configure the service settings to record data for the resource types of interest. We recommend you include provisioned products and AWS CloudFormation stacks, in addition to the major resource types that your team uses. For more information, see [Setting up AWS Config with the console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/gs-console.html). This version of the Connector enables the import of aggregated Config data in a single AWS account from more than one AWS Region or account. To use this feature, you must configure an aggregator in AWS. For more information, see [Setting up an Aggregator using the console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/WhatIsConfig.html).\n\n- **AWS Systems Manager Automation with the Connector** — This feature requires no AWS-side set up. As standard, AWS provides a number of automation documents (runbooks). If you want additional automation documents (runbook), retrieve them in the Connector. For more information, see [Working with Automation Runbooks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/automation-documents.html).\n\n- **AWS Systems Manager OpsCenter with the Connector** — You must enable the service in all Regions and accounts where you want to sync OpsItems. For more information, see [Getting started with OpsCenter](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/what-is-systems-manager.html)\n\n- **AWS Security Hub with the Connector** — You must enable the service in all Regions and accounts where you want to sync Findings. For details, see [Setting up Security Hub](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-settingup.html). We recommend you connect ServiceNow with the primary (main) AWS account for AWS Security Hub. For more information, see [Managing administrator and member accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-accounts.html).\n\n- **Support with the Connector** — Your account must have a [Business](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/plans/business/) or [Enterprise](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/plans/enterprise/) Support plan to use support integration with the Connector.\n\n- **AWS Systems Manager Change Manager with the Connector** — You must enable the service in all Regions and accounts where you want to sync change templates. The AWS Systems Manager Change Manager integration of AWS Service Management Connector introduces a curated version of the integration. It allows customers to execute pre-approved change templates that contain at least one Automation Runbook and does not require approvals during execution from ServiceNow. For more information, see [Setting up Change Manager.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/change-manager-setting-up.html)\n\n- **AWS Systems Manager Incident Manager with the Connector** — You must enable Incident Manager in all AWS Regions and accounts from where you want to sync the incidents.

This data includes the VPN ID, the virtual private gateway (VGW) ID, the customer gateway ID, and the AWS Region where the connection exists. The connection state is recorded as `0` (both tunnels are down), `1` (one of the tunnels is down), or `2` (both tunnels are up).\n\nThis metric allows users to review the status of each VPN connection and the state of the tunnels in each connection.

Hosting destinations tell Amazon GameLift where to look for available resources to host a new game session for players. Aliases are useful in the following scenarios:\n\n- If your game doesn't use multi-fleet queues for game session placement, it requests new game sessions by specifying a Amazon GameLift fleet ID. During the life of a game, you'll replace the fleet multiple times, to update a server build, update hosting hardware and operating system, or resolve performance issues. Use an alias to abstract the fleet ID so that you can seamlessly switch player traffic from an existing fleet to the new one.\n\n- If you want to do something other than create a new game session when a game client requests one. For example, you might want to direct players who are using an out-of-date client to an upgrade website.\n\nAn alias must specify a routing strategy. There are two types. A simple routing strategy routes player traffic to a specified fleet ID, which you can update to redirect traffic. A terminal routing strategy passes a message back to the client instead of creating a new game session. You can change an alias's routing strategy at any time.\n\nIf you use a queue for game session placement, you don't need an alias to redirect traffic when replacing a fleet. With a queue, you can simply add the new fleet and remove the old fleet. This action is not visible to players, because new game session requests are automatically fulfilled using the new fleet. It doesn't impact existing game sessions. You can identify queues destinations by using either a fleet ID or alias.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/gamelift/latest/developerguide/aliases-intro.html", "title": "Select your cookie preferences", "description": "This page allows users to manage their cookie preferences for the AWS site, including essential, performance, functional, and advertising cookies.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 4, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 21:18:47", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"language": "en-US", "deployment_region": "IAD", "product": "Amazon GameLift", "title": "Abstract an Amazon GameLift fleet designation with an alias - Amazon GameLift", "target_state": "aliases-intro", "feedback-no": "feedbackno.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/gamelift/latest/developerguide/aliases-intro.html", "assets_root": "/assets", "rss": "amazon-ec2-release-notes.rss", "keywords": "create,EC2,instances,hosting,server fleet management,game session routing,traffic abstraction", "guide": "Developer Guide", "abstract": "Describes key concepts of Amazon GameLift and its features, including FlexMatch matchmaking, Realtime Servers for standing up lightweight servers, and FleetIQ optimizations to lower hosting costs.

These other DB instances are read-only and are known as Aurora Replicas. We also refer to them as reader instances when discussing the ways that you can combine writer and reader DB instances within a cluster.\n\nAurora Replicas have two main purposes. You can issue queries to them to scale the read operations for your application. You typically do so by connecting to the reader endpoint of the cluster. That way, Aurora can spread the load for read-only connections across as many Aurora Replicas as you have in the cluster. Aurora Replicas also help to increase availability. If the writer instance in a cluster becomes unavailable, Aurora automatically promotes one of the reader instances to take its place as the new writer.\n\nAn Aurora DB cluster can contain up to 15 Aurora Replicas. The Aurora Replicas can be distributed across the Availability Zones that a DB cluster spans within an AWS Region.\n\nThe data in your DB cluster has its own high availability and reliability features, independent of the DB instances in the cluster. If you aren't familiar with Aurora storage features, see Overview of Amazon Aurora storage. The DB cluster volume is physically made up of multiple copies of the data for the DB cluster. The primary instance and the Aurora Replicas in the DB cluster all see the data in the cluster volume as a single logical volume.\n\nAs a result, all Aurora Replicas return the same data for query results with minimal replica lag. This lag is usually much less than 100 milliseconds after the primary instance has written an update. Replica lag varies depending on the rate of database change. That is, during periods where a large amount of write operations occur for the database, you might see an increase in replica lag.\n\nAurora Replica restarts automatically, when it loses communication with the writer DB instance for more than 60 seconds in the following Aurora PostgreSQL versions:\n\n- 14.6 and older versions\n- 13.9 and older versions\n- 12.13 and older versions\n- All Aurora PostgreSQL 11 versions\n\nWith the read availability feature, the Aurora Replicas don't restart automatically. For more information on the read availability feature and the versions where it is applicable, see Improving the read availability of Aurora Replicas.\n\nAurora Replicas work well for read scaling because they are fully dedicated to read operations on your cluster volume. Write operations are managed by the primary instance. Because the cluster volume is shared among all DB instances in your DB cluster, minimal additional work is required to replicate a copy of the data for each Aurora Replica.\n\nTo increase availability, you can use Aurora Replicas as failover targets. That is, if the primary instance fails, an Aurora Replica is promoted to the primary instance. There is a brief interruption during which read and write requests made to the primary instance fail with an exception.\n\nPromoting an Aurora Replica by failover is much faster than recreating the primary instance. If your Aurora DB cluster doesn't include any Aurora Replicas, then your DB cluster isn't available while your DB instance is recovering from the failure.\n\nWhen failover happens, some of the Aurora Replicas might be rebooted, depending on the DB engine version. For example, in Aurora MySQL, Aurora restarts only the writer DB instance and the failover target during a failover. For more information about the rebooting behavior of different Aurora DB engine versions, see Rebooting an Amazon Aurora DB cluster or Amazon Aurora DB instance. For information about what happens to page caches when rebooting or failover, see Survivable page cache.\n\nFor high-availability scenarios, we recommend that you create one or more Aurora Replicas. These should be of the same DB instance class as the primary instance and in different Availability Zones for your Aurora DB cluster. For more information about Aurora Replicas as failover targets, see Fault tolerance for an Aurora DB cluster.\n\nYou can't create an encrypted Aurora Replica for an unencrypted Aurora DB cluster. You can't create an unencrypted Aurora Replica for an encrypted Aurora DB cluster.\n\nYou can use Aurora Replicas within an Aurora cluster as your only form of replication to keep your data highly available. You can also combine the built-in Aurora replication with the other types of replication. Doing so can help to provide an extra level of high availability and geographic distribution of your data.\n\n## Replication with Aurora MySQL\nIn addition to Aurora Replicas, you have the following options for replication with Aurora MySQL:\n\n- Aurora MySQL DB clusters in different AWS Regions.\n- You can replicate data across multiple Regions by using an Aurora global database. For details, see High availability across AWS Regions with Aurora global databases.\n- You can create an Aurora read replica of an Aurora MySQL DB cluster in a different AWS Region, by using MySQL binary log (binlog) replication. Each cluster can have up to five read replicas created this way, each in a different Region.\n- Two Aurora MySQL DB clusters in the same Region, by using MySQL binary log (binlog) replication.\n- An RDS for MySQL DB instance as the source of data and an Aurora MySQL DB cluster, by creating an Aurora read replica of an RDS for MySQL DB instance. Typically, you use this approach for migration to Aurora MySQL, rather than for ongoing replication.\n\n## Replication with Aurora PostgreSQL\nIn addition to Aurora Replicas, you have the following options for replication with Aurora PostgreSQL:\n\n- An Aurora primary DB cluster in one Region and up to five read-only secondary DB clusters in different Regions by using an Aurora global database. Aurora PostgreSQL doesn't support cross-Region Aurora Replicas. However, you can use Aurora global database to scale your Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster's read capabilities to more than one AWS Region and to meet availability goals.\n- Two Aurora PostgreSQL DB clusters in the same Region, by using PostgreSQL's logical replication feature.\n- An RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance as the source of data and an Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster, by creating an Aurora read replica of an RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance. Typically, you use this approach for migration to Aurora PostgreSQL, rather than for ongoing replication.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Replication.html", "title": "Replication with Amazon Aurora", "description": "This page covers the various replication options available with Amazon Aurora, including built-in replication features and traditional replication mechanisms for MySQL and PostgreSQL DB engines.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 6, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 21:20:38", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"guide-locale": "en_us", "forums": "https://repost.aws/tags/TAsibBK6ZeQYihN9as4S_psg", "product": "Amazon Aurora", "pdf": "/pdfs/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-ug.pdf#Aurora.Replication", "description": "Leverage built-in replication options with Amazon Aurora for high availability, read scaling, and data distribution across AWS Regions.", "target_state": "Aurora.Replication", "deployment_region": "IAD", "this_doc_product": "Amazon Aurora", "feedback-item": "RDS", "feedback": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forms/aws-doc-feedback?hidden_service_name=RDS&topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Replication.html", "abstract": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) documentation for Amazon Aurora (Aurora).

{"text": "System: You are a helpful AWS expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Using AWS WAF with Amazon CloudFront\"?\n\nAssistant: This section explains how to use AWS WAF with Amazon CloudFront features.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Select your cookie preferences\nWe use essential cookies and similar tools that are necessary to provide our site and services. We use performance cookies to collect anonymous statistics, so we can understand how customers use our site and make improvements. Essential cookies cannot be deactivated, but you can choose “Customize” or “Decline” to decline performance cookies.\n\nIf you agree, AWS and approved third parties will also use cookies to provide useful site features, remember your preferences, and display relevant content, including relevant advertising. To accept or decline all non-essential cookies, choose “Accept” or “Decline.” To make more detailed choices, choose “Customize.”\n\nAcceptDeclineCustomize\n\n## Customize cookie preferences\nWe use cookies and similar tools (collectively, \"cookies\") for the following purposes.\n\n### Essential\nEssential cookies are necessary to provide our site and services and cannot be deactivated. They are usually set in response to your actions on the site, such as setting your privacy preferences, signing in, or filling in forms.\n\n### Performance\nPerformance cookies provide anonymous statistics about how customers navigate our site so we can improve site experience and performance. Approved third parties may perform analytics on our behalf, but they cannot use the data for their own purposes.\n\nAllow performance category\n\nAllowed\n\n### Functional\nFunctional cookies help us provide useful site features, remember your preferences, and display relevant content. Approved third parties may set these cookies to provide certain site features. If you do not allow these cookies, then some or all of these services may not function properly.\n\nAllow functional category\n\nAllowed\n\n### Advertising\nAdvertising cookies may be set through our site by us or our advertising partners and help us deliver relevant marketing content. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less relevant advertising.\n\nAllow advertising category\n\nAllowed\n\nBlocking some types of cookies may impact your experience of our sites. You may review and change your choices at any time by selecting Cookie preferences in the footer of this site. We and selected third-parties use cookies or similar technologies as specified in the AWS Cookie Notice.\n\n## Unable to save cookie preferences\nWe will only store essential cookies at this time, because we were unable to save your cookie preferences.\n\nIf you want to change your cookie preferences, try again later using the link in the AWS console footer, or contact support if the problem persists.\n\n## Using AWS WAF with CloudFront custom error pages\nBy default, when AWS WAF blocks a web request based on the criteria that you specify, it returns HTTP status code `403 (Forbidden)` to CloudFront, and CloudFront returns that status code to the viewer. The viewer then displays a brief and sparsely formatted default message similar to the following:\n\n```hljs scala\n\nForbidden: You don't have permission to access /myfilename.html on this server.\n```\n\nYou can override this behavior in your AWS WAF web ACL rules by defining custom responses. For more information about customizing response behavior using AWS WAF rules, see Sending custom responses for Block actions.\n\nResponses that you customize using AWS WAF rules take precedence over any response specifications that you define in CloudFront custom error pages.\n\nIf you'd rather display a custom error message through CloudFront, possibly using the same formatting as the rest of your website, you can configure CloudFront to return to the viewer an object (for example, an HTML file) that contains your custom error message.\n\nCloudFront can't distinguish between an HTTP status code 403 that is returned by your origin and one that is returned by AWS WAF when a request is blocked. This means that you can't return different custom error pages based on the different causes of an HTTP status code 403.\n\n## Using AWS WAF with CloudFront for applications running on your own HTTP server\nWhen you use AWS WAF with CloudFront, you can protect your applications running on any HTTP webserver, whether it's a webserver that's running in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) or a webserver that you manage privately. You can also configure CloudFront to require HTTPS between CloudFront and your own webserver, as well as between viewers and CloudFront.\n\nTo require HTTPS between CloudFront and your own webserver, you can use the CloudFront custom origin feature and configure the Origin Protocol Policy and the Origin Domain Name settings for specific origins. In your CloudFront configuration, you can specify the DNS name of the server along with the port and the protocol that you want CloudFront to use when fetching objects from your origin. You should also ensure that the SSL/TLS certificate on your custom origin server matches the origin domain name you’ve configured. When you use your own HTTP webserver outside of AWS, you must use a certificate that is signed by a trusted third-party certificate authority (CA), for example, Comodo, DigiCert, or Symantec. For more information about requiring HTTPS for communication between CloudFront and your own webserver, see the topic Requiring HTTPS for Communication Between CloudFront and Your Custom Origin in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.\n\nTo require HTTPS between viewers and CloudFront, you can change the Viewer Protocol Policy for one or more cache behaviors in your CloudFront distribution.\n\n## Choosing the HTTP methods that CloudFront responds to\nWhen you create an Amazon CloudFront web distribution, you choose the HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to process and forward to your origin. You can choose from the following options:\n\n- **`GET`, `HEAD`** – You can use CloudFront only to get objects from your origin or to get object headers.\n- **`GET`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`** – You can use CloudFront only to get objects from your origin, get object headers, or retrieve a list of the options that your origin server supports.\n- **`GET`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, `PUT`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`** – You can use CloudFront to get, add, update, and delete objects, and to get object headers. In addition, you can perform other `POST` operations such as submitting data from a web form.\n\nYou also can use AWS WAF byte match rule statements to allow or block requests based on the HTTP method.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/waf/latest/developerguide/cloudfront-features.html", "title": "Using AWS WAF with Amazon CloudFront", "description": "This section explains how to use AWS WAF with Amazon CloudFront features.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 6, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 21:20:57", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"this_doc_guide": "Developer Guide", "keywords": "AWS Firewall Manager,Firewall Manager,AWS WAF,web application firewall,firewall,ACL,access control list", "target_state": "cloudfront-features", "title": "Using AWS WAF with Amazon CloudFront - AWS WAF, AWS Firewall Manager, and AWS Shield Advanced", "product": "AWS WAF, AWS Firewall Manager, and AWS Shield Advanced", "pdf": "/pdfs/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-dg.pdf#cloudfront-features", "feedback-no": "feedbackno.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/waf/latest/developerguide/cloudfront-features.html", "language": "en-US", "rss": "aws-waf-doc-history.rss", "tocs": "toc-contents.json", "deployment_region": "IAD", "default_state": "cloudfront-features", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "assets_root": "/assets", "description": "This section explains how to use AWS WAF with Amazon CloudFront features.", "feedback-item": "AWS WAF", "feedback-yes": "feedbackyes.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/waf/latest/developerguide/cloudfront-features.html", "this_doc_product": "AWS WAF, AWS Firewall Manager, and AWS Shield Advanced", "forums": "https://repost.aws/tags/TAKdJ093DSSdGOQ1VVKX4EvQ", "abstract": "Describes how to get started with AWS WAF and AWS Firewall Manager, the AWS web application firewall services, and Shield Advanced, which provides expanded DDoS attack protection.", "feedback": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forms/aws-doc-feedback?hidden_service_name=AWS%20WAF&topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/waf/latest/developerguide/cloudfront-features.html", "favicon": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/assets/images/favicon.ico", "guide-locale": "en_us", "guide": "Developer Guide", "scrapeId": "1166097c-6744-4fc8-9760-b032191a511f", "sourceURL": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/waf/latest/developerguide/cloudfront-features.html", "url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/waf/latest/developerguide/cloudfront-features.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

For example, when you create a predictor using a dataset group, the dataset group is the parent resource and the predictor is the child resource. When deleting a Forecast resource, you must also delete its child resources.\n\nDeleting a resource or resource tree is an irreversible action. It can't be stopped after it begins.\n\n## Understanding Resource Trees\nThe Forecast resource tree is a parent-child hierarchical structure. _Child resources_ are resources that were created from another resource. For example, when a forecast is generated from a predictor, the forecast is the child resource and the predictor is the parent resource.\n\nTo delete a Forecast resource, you must also delete its entire resource tree. This includes all child resources of the parent resource, and also the child resources of those child resources.\n\n###### Note\nDeleting a resource tree deletes only Amazon Forecast resources. It doesn't delete datasets or exported files stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).\n\nForecast resources have the following parent-child resource hierarchies.\n\nFor example, the resource tree of a _predictor_ includes _predictor backtest jobs_, _forecasts_, and _forecast export_ jobs as child resources. The resource tree of a _forecast_ includes only _forecast export_ jobs as child resources.\n\n| Parent Resource | Child Resources |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Dataset** | Dataset import jobs |\n| **Dataset group** | Predictors, predictor backtest export jobs, predictor explainabilities, predictor explainability exports, forecasts, forecast export jobs, forecast explainabilities, forecast explainability exports |\n| **Predictor** | Predictor backtest export jobs, predictor explainabilities, predictor explainability exports, forecasts, forecast export jobs, forecast explainabilities, forecast explainability exports |\n| **Forecast** | Forecast export jobs, forecast explainabilities, forecast explainability exports, what-if analyses, what-if forecasts, what-if forecast exports |\n| **Explainability** | Explainability exports |\n| **What-if analysis** | what-if forecasts, what-if forecast exports |\n| **What-if forecast** | what-if forecast exports |\n\nIf a resource doesn't have any child resources, you can delete it individually. If a resource has child resources, you must delete the entire resource tree.\n\nWhen using the Forecast console, you are automatically prompted to delete the entire resource tree when you delete a resource with child resources. When using the AWS Software Development Kit (SDK), use the [DeleteResourceTree](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/forecast/latest/dg/API_DeleteResourceTree.html) operation to delete a resource tree.\n\n## Deleting Individual Resources\nYou can delete an individual resource if it's not associated with any child resources. For example, you can delete an individual predictor that has not been used to create any forecasts or export jobs.\n\nYou can delete resources using the Amazon Forecast console or the AWS Software Development Kit (SDK).\n\nConsole\n\n**To delete a resource**\n1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Forecast console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/forecast/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/forecast/).\n2. In the navigation pane, choose the resource type of the resource that you want to delete.\n3. Choose the resource and choose **Delete**.\n4. In the confirmation field, type `delete`.\n5. Choose **Delete**.\n\n![Confirmation dialog for deleting DatasetGroup1, with text field to type \"delete\" for confirmation.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/forecast/latest/dg/images/resource-delete.PNG)\n\nSDK\n\n**To delete a resource**\nThe operation that you use to delete a resource depends on its resource type. Specify the resource Amazon Resource Name (ARN) in the operation for the resource type the you want to delete:\n\n- [DeleteDataset](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/forecast/latest/dg/API_DeleteDataset.html)\n- [DeleteDatasetGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/forecast/latest/dg/API_DeleteDatasetGroup.html)\n- [DeleteDatasetImportJob](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/forecast/latest/dg/API_DeleteDatasetImportJob.html)\n- [DeletePredictor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/forecast/latest/dg/API_DeletePredictor.html)\n- [DeletePredictorBacktestExportJob](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/forecast/latest/dg/API_DeletePredictorBacktestExportJob.html)\n- [DeleteForecast](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/forecast/latest/dg/API_DeleteForecast.html)\n- [DeleteForecastExportJob](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/forecast/latest/dg/API_DeleteForecastExportJob.html)\n- [DeleteExplainability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/forecast/latest/dg/API_DeleteExplainability.html)\n\nFor example, to delete a predictor with the [DeletePredictor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/forecast/latest/dg/API_DeletePredictor.html) operation, specify the value of `PredictorArn` to the ARN of the predictor that you want to delete.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"PredictorArn\": \"arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource-id\"\n}\n```\n\n## Deleting Resource Trees\nDeleting a resource tree deletes the parent resource and all associated child resources. For example, you can delete a predictor and all child resources — predictor backtest export jobs, forecasts, and forecast export jobs — associated with the predictor. You delete a resource tree by specifying the parent resource.\n\nYou can delete resource trees using the Amazon Forecast console or the AWS Software Development Kit (SDK).\n\nConsole\n\n**To delete a resource tree**\n1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Forecast console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/forecast/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/forecast/).\n2. In the navigation pane, choose the resource type of the parent resource.\n3. Choose the parent resource that you want to delete. and choose **Delete**.\n4. In the confirmation field, type `delete`.\n5. Choose **Delete**.\n\n![Confirmation dialog for deleting DatasetGroup1, showing affected resources and input field.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/forecast/latest/dg/images/resource-tree-delete.PNG)\n\nSDK\n\n**To delete a resource tree**\nTo delete a resource tree, use the [DeleteResourceTree](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/forecast/latest/dg/API_DeleteResourceTree.html) operation.

SageMaker AI saves the checkpoints to the default local path '/opt/ml/checkpoints' and copies them to Amazon S3.\n\n- Deep Learning Containers: [TensorFlow](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/frameworks/tensorflow/sagemaker.tensorflow.html), [PyTorch](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/frameworks/pytorch/sagemaker.pytorch.html), [MXNet](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/frameworks/mxnet/sagemaker.mxnet.html), and [HuggingFace](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/frameworks/huggingface/sagemaker.huggingface.html)\n\nIf you are using the HuggingFace framework estimator, you need to specify a checkpoint output path through hyperparameters. For more information, see [Run training on Amazon SageMaker AI](https://huggingface.co/transformers/sagemaker.html#spot-instances) in the HuggingFace documentation.\n\n- Built-in algorithms: [Image Classification](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/image-classification.html), [Object Detection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/object-detection.html), [Semantic Segmentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/semantic-segmentation.html), and [XGBoost](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/xgboost.html) (0.90-1 or later)\n\nIf you are using the XGBoost algorithm in framework mode (script mode), you need to bring an XGBoost training script with checkpointing that's manually configured. For more information about the XGBoost training methods to save model snapshots, see [Training XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/python_intro.html#training) in the XGBoost Python SDK documentation.\n\nIf a pre-built algorithm that does not support checkpointing is used in a managed spot training job, SageMaker AI does not allow a maximum wait time greater than an hour for the job in order to limit wasted training time from interrupts.\n\n## Considerations for checkpointing\nConsider the following when using checkpoints in SageMaker AI.\n\n- To avoid overwrites in distributed training with multiple instances, you must manually configure the checkpoint file names and paths in your training script. The high-level SageMaker AI checkpoint configuration specifies a single Amazon S3 location without additional suffixes or prefixes to tag checkpoints from multiple instances.\n\n- The SageMaker Python SDK does not support high-level configuration for checkpointing frequency.

To do this, you must have permissions to pass the role to the service.\n\nThe following example error occurs when an IAM user named `marymajor` tries to use the console to perform an action in Systems Manager. However, the action requires the service to have permissions that are granted by a service role. Mary does not have permissions to pass the role to the service.\n\n```nohighlight hljs\nUser: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/marymajor is not authorized to perform: iam:PassRole\n```\n\nIn this case, Mary's policies must be updated to allow her to perform the `iam:PassRole` action.\n\nIf you need help, contact your AWS administrator. Your administrator is the person who provided you with your sign-in credentials.\n\n## I want to allow people outside of my AWS account to access my Systems Manager resources\nYou can create a role that users in other accounts or people outside of your organization can use to access your resources. You can specify who is trusted to assume the role. For services that support resource-based policies or access control lists (ACLs), you can use those policies to grant people access to your resources.\n\nTo learn more, consult the following:\n\n- To learn whether Systems Manager supports these features, see [How AWS Systems Manager works with IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/systems-manager/latest/userguide/security_iam_service-with-iam.html).\n- To learn how to provide access to your resources across AWS accounts that you own, see [Providing access to an IAM user in another AWS account that you own](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_common-scenarios_aws-accounts.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.\n- To learn how to provide access to your resources to third-party AWS accounts, see [Providing access to AWS accounts owned by third parties](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_common-scenarios_third-party.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.\n- To learn how to provide access through identity federation, see [Providing access to externally authenticated users (identity federation)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_common-scenarios_federated-users.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.\n- To learn the difference between using roles and resource-based policies for cross-account access, see [Cross account resource access in IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies-cross-account-resource-access.html) in the _IAM User Guide_.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/systems-manager/latest/userguide/security_iam_troubleshoot.html", "title": "Troubleshooting AWS Systems Manager identity and access", "description": "Use the following information to help you diagnose and fix common issues that you might encounter when working with AWS Systems Manager and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 6, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 21:26:49", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"title": "Troubleshooting AWS Systems Manager identity and access - AWS Systems Manager", "feedback-no": "feedbackno.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/systems-manager/latest/userguide/security_iam_troubleshoot.html", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "default_state": "security_iam_troubleshoot", "this_doc_guide": "User Guide", "favicon": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/assets/images/favicon.ico", "pdf": "/pdfs/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-ug.pdf#security_iam_troubleshoot", "rss": "aws-systems-manager-user-guide-updates.rss", "forums": "https://repost.aws/tags/TA-UbbRGVYRWCDaCvae6itYg", "keywords": "EC2 Systems Manager,Simple Systems Manager,SSM,Patch Manager,Parameter Store,Maintenance Window,Run Command,State Manager,Session Manager,SSM Agent,SSM Documents,Systems Manager,AWS Resource Groups,AppConfig,OpsCenter,Explorer,Change Calendar,Quick Setup,Change Manager,Fleet Manager", "feedback-item": "Systems Manager", "guide": "User Guide", "language": "en-US", "assets_root": "/assets", "target_state": "security_iam_troubleshoot", "guide-locale": "en_us", "feedback-yes": "feedbackyes.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/systems-manager/latest/userguide/security_iam_troubleshoot.html", "tocs": "toc-contents.json", "feedback": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forms/aws-doc-feedback?hidden_service_name=Systems%20Manager&topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/systems-manager/latest/userguide/security_iam_troubleshoot.html", "deployment_region": "IAD", "product": "AWS Systems Manager", "description": "Learn how to fix common issues that you might encounter when working with Systems Manager and IAM.", "abstract": "AWS Systems Manager (formerly Amazon EC2 Systems Manager) is a unified interface that allows you to centralize operational data and automate tasks across your AWS resources.

You pass through metadata that is already present in the source input. You set up to include this metadata when you create or modify the channel.\n\n- Insert a timestamp at a regular interval. You set up to include this metadata when you create or modify the channel. See [Inserting ID3 metadata when creating the MediaLive channel](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/medialive/latest/ug/insert-timed-metadata.html).\n\n- Insert metadata once, at a specified time. You insert this metadata by creating an action in the channel schedule. See [Inserting ID3 metadata using the schedule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/medialive/latest/ug/insert-id3-metadata-via-schedule.html).\n\n- Insert metadata in every segment. You insert this metadata by creating an action in the channel schedule. You insert the action as plain text, using the tag option, or as base64, using the ID3 option. See [Inserting ID3 metadata using the schedule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/medialive/latest/ug/insert-id3-metadata-via-schedule.html).\n\n## Scope of the insertion\nYou configure each mechanism separately, and you configure each mechanism at the output level. You can configure one group of outputs with one mechanism, and another group or an overlapping group with another mechanism. Each mechanism as its own scope. In the following table, read across each row to determine the scope of the mechanism.\n\n## Frames, ID3 tags, PIDs\nThe metadata is inserted into a specific ID3 frame (for example, TXXX). The frame is inserted in an ID3 tag. The ID3 tag goes in a PID (for a TS output) or the emsg event (for an MP4 output).\n\n## Frame types\nThe container types are set as follows for each mechanism.\n\n## PID for the ID3 tag\nWith TS output groups, all the mechanisms for ID3 metadata insert the ID3 tag in the same PID. The default is 502, but you have the option to override the default in any output group.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/medialive/latest/ug/id3-metadata.html", "title": "Working with ID3 metadata", "description": "This page covers how to include ID3 metadata in various output groups in MediaLive, detailing different mechanisms for insertion and their configurations.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 8, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 21:27:24", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"abstract": "Use MediaLive to create live outputs for broadcast and streaming delivery.

For information about the tools you can use for the export and import processes and for more detail, see Import/export tools for migrating from SQL Server to Babelfish. To load the data, we recommend using AWS DMS with an Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster as the target endpoint.\n\n1. Create a new Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster with Babelfish turned on. To learn how, see Creating a Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster.\n\n2. On the SQL Server database that you want to migrate, export the data definition language (DDL). The DDL is SQL code that describes database objects that contain user data (such as tables, indexes, and views) and user-written database code (such as stored procedures, user-defined functions, and triggers).\n\n3. Run an assessment tool to evaluate the scope of any changes that you might need to make so that Babelfish can effectively support the application running on SQL Server.\n\n4. Review the AWS DMS target endpoint limitations and update the DDL script as necessary.\n\n5. On your new Babelfish DB cluster, run the DDL within your specified T-SQL database to create only the schemas, user-defined data types, and tables with their primary key constraints.\n\n6. Use AWS DMS to migrate your data from SQL Server to Babelfish tables.\n\n7. When the data load completes, create all the remaining T-SQL objects that support the application on your Babelfish cluster.\n\n8. Reconfigure your client application to connect to the Babelfish endpoint instead of your SQL Server database.\n\n9. Modify your application as needed and retest.\n\n## Evaluating and handling differences between SQL Server and Babelfish\nFor best results, we recommend that you evaluate the generated DDL/DML and the client query code before actually migrating your SQL Server database application to Babelfish. Depending on the version of Babelfish and the specific features of SQL Server that your application implements, you might need to refactor your application or use alternatives for functionality that aren't fully supported yet in Babelfish.\n\n## Import/export tools for migrating from SQL Server to Babelfish\nWe recommend that you use AWS DMS as the primary tool for migrating from SQL Server to Babelfish. However, Babelfish supports several other ways to migrate data using SQL Server tools that includes the following.\n\n- SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) for all versions of Babelfish.\n- Use the SSMS Import/Export Wizard for Babelfish versions 2.1.0 and later.\n- The Microsoft bulk data copy program (bcp) utility lets you copy data from a Microsoft SQL Server instance to a data file in the format you specify.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/babelfish-migration.html", "title": "Migrating a SQL Server database to Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL", "description": "You can use Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL to migrate an SQL Server database to an Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 6, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 21:27:50", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"description": "Use Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL to ease migration from a SQL Server database to an Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster.", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "title": "Migrating a SQL Server database to Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL - Amazon Aurora", "language": "en-US", "guide-locale": "en_us", "this_doc_guide": "User Guide for Aurora", "guide": "User Guide for Aurora", "rss": "auroraupdates.rss", "feedback": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forms/aws-doc-feedback?hidden_service_name=RDS&topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/babelfish-migration.html", "product": "Amazon Aurora", "assets_root": "/assets", "keywords": "Amazon Relational Database Service,RDS,DB instance,Amazon Aurora,Aurora", "feedback-no": "feedbackno.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/babelfish-migration.html", "deployment_region": "IAD", "this_doc_product": "Amazon Aurora", "pdf": "/pdfs/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-ug.pdf#babelfish-migration", "target_state": "babelfish-migration", "favicon": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/assets/images/favicon.ico", "feedback-item": "RDS", "forums": "https://repost.aws/tags/TAsibBK6ZeQYihN9as4S_psg", "tocs": "toc-contents.json", "default_state": "babelfish-migration", "feedback-yes": "feedbackyes.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/babelfish-migration.html", "abstract": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) documentation for Amazon Aurora (Aurora).

In [step 5](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create-console.html#access_policies_create-json-editor), use the following **permission policy** for the IAM role.\n\n- Replace `partition` with the partition that the resource is in. For standard AWS Regions, the partition is `aws`. If you have resources in other partitions, the partition is `aws-partitionname`. For example, the partition for resources in the AWS GovCloud (US-West) is `aws-us-gov`.\n- Replace `region` with the name of the AWS Region that hosts the Amazon Pinpoint project.\n- Replace `accountId` with the unique ID for your AWS account.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n    \"Statement\": [\n        {\n            \"Sid\": \"PinpointUsesSESForEmailSends\",\n            \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n            \"Action\": [\n                \"ses:SendEmail\",\n                \"ses:SendRawEmail\"\n            ],\n            \"Resource\": [\n                \"arn:partition:ses:region:accountId:identity/*\",\n                \"arn:partition:ses:region:accountId:configuration-set/*\"\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n2. Create a new **trust policy** by following the directions in [Creating a role using custom trust policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-custom.html) in the [IAM User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/).\n1. In [step 4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-custom.html), use the following **trust policy**.\n\n- Replace `accountId` with the unique ID for your AWS account.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n    \"Statement\": [\n        {\n            \"Sid\": \"AllowPinpoint\",\n            \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n            \"Principal\": {\n                \"Service\": \"pinpoint.amazonaws.com\"\n            },\n            \"Action\": \"sts:AssumeRole\",\n            \"Condition\": {\n                \"StringEquals\": {\n                    \"aws:SourceAccount\": \"accountId\"\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n2. In [step 11](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-custom.html), add the **permission policy** that you created in the previous step.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/permissions-ses.html", "title": "IAM role for sending email with Amazon SES", "description": "This page provides guidance on creating an IAM role for Amazon Pinpoint to send emails using Amazon SES, including necessary permissions and policies.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 4, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 21:28:06", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"title": "IAM role for sending email with Amazon SES - Amazon Pinpoint", "rss": "amazon-pinpoint-dev-guide-rss-updates.rss", "description": "Create an IAM role that sets up Amazon Pinpoint to automatically send email through Amazon SES.", "this_doc_product": "Amazon Pinpoint", "this_doc_guide": "Developer Guide", "default_state": "permissions-ses", "language": "en-US", "feedback-yes": "feedbackyes.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/permissions-ses.html", "feedback": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forms/aws-doc-feedback?hidden_service_name=Pinpoint&topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/permissions-ses.html", "feedback-item": "Pinpoint", "forums": "https://repost.aws/tags/TAc2_3dD_zSuaTNb_sYZ46ew", "guide-locale": "en_us", "target_state": "permissions-ses", "deployment_region": "IAD", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "tocs": "toc-contents.json", "assets_root": "/assets", "favicon": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/assets/images/favicon.ico", "guide": "Developer Guide", "product": "Amazon Pinpoint", "abstract": "This is the official Amazon Web Services (AWS) developer documentation for Amazon Pinpoint.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful AWS expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Deploy models with Amazon SageMaker Serverless Inference\"?\n\nAssistant: Amazon SageMaker Serverless Inference is a purpose-built inference option that enables you to deploy and scale ML models without configuring or managing any of the underlying infrastructure.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Select your cookie preferences\nWe use essential cookies and similar tools that are necessary to provide our site and services.

You may review and change your choices at any time by selecting Cookie preferences in the footer of this site. We and selected third-parties use cookies or similar technologies as specified in the [AWS Cookie Notice](https://aws.amazon.com/legal/cookies/).\n\n## Unable to save cookie preferences\nWe will only store essential cookies at this time, because we were unable to save your cookie preferences.\n\nIf you want to change your cookie preferences, try again later using the link in the AWS console footer, or contact support if the problem persists.\n\n## How it works\nThe following diagram shows the workflow of on-demand Serverless Inference and the benefits of using a serverless endpoint.\n\nWhen you create an on-demand serverless endpoint, SageMaker AI provisions and manages the compute resources for you. Then, you can make inference requests to the endpoint and receive model predictions in response. SageMaker AI scales the compute resources up and down as needed to handle your request traffic, and you only pay for what you use.\n\nFor Provisioned Concurrency, Serverless Inference also integrates with Application Auto Scaling, so that you can manage Provisioned Concurrency based on a target metric or on a schedule.\n\n## Container support\nFor your endpoint container, you can choose either a SageMaker AI-provided container or bring your own. SageMaker AI provides containers for its built-in algorithms and prebuilt Docker images for some of the most common machine learning frameworks, such as Apache MXNet, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Chainer. For a list of available SageMaker AI images, see [Available\\ Deep Learning Containers Images](https://github.com/aws/deep-learning-containers/blob/master/available_images.md). If you are bringing your own container, you must modify it to work with SageMaker AI. For more information about bringing your own container, see [Adapt your own inference container for\\ Amazon SageMaker AI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/sagemaker/latest/dg/adapt-inference-container.html).\n\n## Memory size\nYour serverless endpoint has a minimum RAM size of 1024 MB (1 GB), and the maximum RAM size you can choose is 6144 MB (6 GB). The memory sizes you can choose are 1024 MB, 2048 MB, 3072 MB, 4096 MB, 5120 MB, or 6144 MB. Serverless Inference auto-assigns compute resources proportional to the memory you select. If you choose a larger memory size, your container has access to more vCPUs. Choose your endpoint’s memory size according to your model size. Generally, the memory size should be at least as large as your model size. You may need to benchmark in order to choose the right memory selection for your model based on your latency SLAs.\n\n## Concurrent invocations\nOn-demand Serverless Inference manages predefined scaling policies and quotas for the capacity of your endpoint. Serverless endpoints have a quota for how many concurrent invocations can be processed at the same time. If the endpoint is invoked before it finishes processing the first request, then it handles the second request concurrently.\n\n## Minimizing cold starts\nIf your on-demand Serverless Inference endpoint does not receive traffic for a while and then your endpoint suddenly receives new requests, it can take some time for your endpoint to spin up the compute resources to process the requests. This is called a _cold_ start. Since serverless endpoints provision compute resources on demand, your endpoint may experience cold starts.\n\n## Feature exclusions\nSome of the features currently available for SageMaker AI Real-time Inference are not supported for Serverless Inference, including GPUs, AWS marketplace model packages, private Docker registries, Multi-Model Endpoints, VPC configuration, network isolation, data capture, multiple production variants, Model Monitor, and inference pipelines.\n\n## Getting started\nYou can create, update, describe, and delete a serverless endpoint using the SageMaker AI console, the AWS SDKs, the [Amazon SageMaker Python SDK](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html#sagemaker-serverless-inference), and the AWS CLI.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful AWS expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Patching - Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka\"?\n\nAssistant: This page covers the patching process for Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK), including details on how patching works for both Standard and Express brokers, and best practices for maintaining high availability during updates.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Patching on MSK Provisioned clusters\nPeriodically, Amazon MSK updates software on the brokers in your cluster. Maintenance includes planned updates or unplanned repairs. Planned maintenance includes operating system updates, security updates, certificate renewals, and other software updates required to maintain the health, security, and performance of your cluster. We perform unplanned maintenance to resolve sudden infrastructure degradation. We perform maintenance on Standard and Express brokers, but the experiences are different.\n\n## Patching for Standard brokers\nUpdates to your Standard brokers have no impact on your applications' writes and reads if you follow best practices. Amazon MSK uses rolling updates for software to maintain high availability of your clusters. During this process, brokers are rebooted one at a time, and Kafka automatically moves leadership to another online broker. Kafka clients have built-in mechanisms to automatically detect the change in leadership for the partitions and continue to write and read data into a MSK cluster. Follow Best practices for Apache Kafka clients for smooth operation of your cluster at all times, including during patching. Following a broker going offline, it is normal to see transient disconnect errors on your clients. You will also observe for a brief window (up to 2 mins, typically less) some spikes in p99 read and write latency (typically high milliseconds, up to ~2 seconds). These spikes are expected and are caused by the client re-reconnecting to a new leader broker; it does not impact your produce or consume and will resolve following the re-connect. For more information, see Broker offline and client failover. You will also observe an increase in the metric UnderReplicatedPartitions, which is expected as the partitions on the broker that was shut down are no longer replicating data. This has no impact on applications' writes and reads as replicas for these partitions that are hosted on other brokers are now serving the requests. After the software update, when the broker comes back online, it needs to \"catch up\" on the messages produced while it was offline. During catch up, you may also observe an increase in usage of the volume throughput and CPU. These should have no impact on writes and reads into the cluster if you have enough CPU, memory, network, and volume resources on your brokers.\n\n## Patching for Express brokers\nThere are no maintenance windows for Express brokers. Amazon MSK automatically updates your cluster on an ongoing basis in a time distributed manner, meaning you can expect occasional and singular broker reboots across the month. This ensures you do not need to make any plans or accommodations around one-time cluster-wide maintenance windows. As always, traffic will remain uninterrupted during a broker reboot as leadership will change to other brokers that will continue serving requests. Express brokers come configured with best practice settings and guardrails that make your cluster resilient to load changes that may occur during maintenance. Amazon MSK sets throughput quotas on your Express brokers to mitigate the impact of overloading your cluster which can lead to issues during broker restarts. These improvements eliminate the need for advance notifications, planning, and maintenance windows when you use Express brokers. Express brokers always replicate your data three ways so your clients automatically failover during reboots. You don't need to worry about topics becoming unavailable because of replication factor set to 1 or 2. Also, catch up for a restarted Express broker is faster than on Standard brokers. The faster patching speed on Express brokers means that there will be minimal planning disruption to any control plane activities you may have scheduled for your cluster. As with all Apache Kafka applications, there is still a shared client-server contract for clients connecting to Express brokers. It's still critical to configure your clients to handle leadership failover between brokers. Follow the Best practices for Apache Kafka clients for a smooth operation of your cluster at all times, including during patching. Following a broker restart, it is normal to see transient disconnect errors on your clients. This will not affect your produce and consume as follower brokers will take over partition leadership. Your Apache Kafka clients will automatically fail-over and start sending requests to the new leader brokers.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/msk/latest/developerguide/patching-impact.html", "title": "Patching - Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka", "description": "This page covers the patching process for Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK), including details on how patching works for both Standard and Express brokers, and best practices for maintaining high availability during updates.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 3, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 21:29:08", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"feedback": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forms/aws-doc-feedback?hidden_service_name=msk&topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/msk/latest/developerguide/patching-impact.html", "default_state": "patching-impact", "assets_root": "/assets", "tocs": "toc-contents.json", "rss": "amazon-msk-release-notes.rss", "guide-locale": "en_us", "language": "en-US", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "target_state": "patching-impact", "description": "The impact of software updates on Kafka clients and applications.", "product": "Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka", "guide": "Developer Guide", "abstract": "Developer guide for Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka.", "this_doc_guide": "Developer Guide", "deployment_region": "IAD", "pdf": "/pdfs/msk/latest/developerguide/MSKDevGuide.pdf#patching-impact", "forums": "https://repost.aws/tags/TAhybM_7u2QN2GsWOc4aJVDg", "title": "Patching - Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka", "keywords": "Apache Kafka,Apache ZooKeeper,MSK,Amazon MSK,Broker,cluster,MSK cluster", "favicon": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/assets/images/favicon.ico", "feedback-yes": "feedbackyes.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/msk/latest/developerguide/patching-impact.html", "feedback-no": "feedbackno.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/msk/latest/developerguide/patching-impact.html", "feedback-item": "msk", "this_doc_product": "Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka", "scrapeId": "98f1c8cb-7859-406b-8554-3fa646d37198", "sourceURL": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/msk/latest/developerguide/patching-impact.html", "url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/msk/latest/developerguide/patching-impact.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

The AWS account is free. You pay only for the services and resources that you use.\n\nIf you do not have an AWS account, complete the following steps to create one.\n\n###### To sign up for an AWS account\n\n1. Open [https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup).\n2. Follow the online instructions.\nPart of the sign-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a verification code on the phone keypad.\n\nWhen you sign up for an AWS account, an _AWS account root user_ is created. The root user has access to all AWS services and resources in the account. As a security best practice, assign administrative access to a user, and use only the root user to perform [tasks that require root user access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.html#root-user-tasks).\n\n**Optionally, set up the needed AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions.**\nAccess to manage Amazon DocumentDB resources such as clusters, instances, and cluster parameter groups requires credentials that AWS can use to authenticate your requests. For more information, see [Identity and Access Management for Amazon DocumentDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/documentdb/latest/developerguide/security-iam.html).\n\n1. In the search bar of the AWS Management Console, type in IAM and select **IAM** in the drop down menu that appears.\n2. Once you're in the IAM console, select **Users** from the navigation pane.\n3. Select your username.\n4. Click the button **Add permissions**.\n5. Select **Attach existing policies directly**.\n6. Type `AmazonDocDBFullAccess` in the search bar and select it once it appears in the search results.\n7. Click the blue button at the bottom that says **Next: Review**.\n8.

The maximum number of concurrently running builds can vary. For more information, see Quotas for AWS CodeBuild.\n\n- If the build project has a concurrent build limit set, builds return an error if the number of running builds reaches the concurrent build limit for the project. For more information, see Enable concurrent build limit.\n\n- If the build project does not have a concurrent build limit set, builds are queued if the number of running builds reaches the concurrent build limit for the platform and compute type. The maximum number of builds in a queue is five times the concurrent build limit. For more information, see Quotas for AWS CodeBuild.\n\nA build in a queue that does not start after the number of minutes specified in its time out value is removed from the queue. The default timeout value is eight hours. You can override the build queue timeout with a value between five minutes and eight hours when you run your build. For more information, see Run AWS CodeBuild builds manually.\n\nIt is not possible to predict the order in which queued builds start.\n\n## Note\nYou can access the history of a build for one year.\n\n## Topics\n- Run AWS CodeBuild builds manually\n- Run builds on AWS Lambda compute\n- Run builds on reserved capacity fleets\n- Run builds in batches\n- Execute parallel tests in batch builds\n- Cache builds to improve performance\n- Delete builds in AWS CodeBuild\n- Retry builds manually in AWS CodeBuild\n- Retry builds automatically in AWS CodeBuild\n- Stop builds in AWS CodeBuild\n- Stop batch builds in AWS CodeBuild\n- Trigger AWS CodeBuild builds automatically\n- View build details in AWS CodeBuild\n- View a list of build IDs in AWS CodeBuild\n- View a list of build IDs for a build project in AWS CodeBuild\n- View a running build in Session Manager\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/codebuild/latest/userguide/builds-working.html", "title": "Builds in AWS CodeBuild", "description": "A build represents a set of actions performed by AWS CodeBuild to create output artifacts based on a set of input artifacts.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 6, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 21:31:45", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"feedback": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forms/aws-doc-feedback?hidden_service_name=CodeBuild&topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/codebuild/latest/userguide/builds-working.html", "keywords": "AWS CodeBuild,CodeBuild,AWS,Developer Tools,Developer Tools Console,Developer Tools Services,Developer Tools AWS,CI/CD,continuous integration,continuous delivery,DevOps", "title": "Builds in AWS CodeBuild - AWS CodeBuild", "tocs": "toc-contents.json", "feedback-item": "CodeBuild", "default_state": "builds-working", "feedback-yes": "feedbackyes.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/codebuild/latest/userguide/builds-working.html", "language": "en-US", "feedback-no": "feedbackno.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/codebuild/latest/userguide/builds-working.html", "forums": "https://repost.aws/tags/TA3PlC5MYDQLSIC8057qi90w", "assets_root": "/assets", "product": "AWS CodeBuild", "guide": "User Guide", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "abstract": "Describes how you can use AWS CodeBuild, an AWS service that builds your software applications in the AWS cloud.", "guide-locale": "en_us", "description": "Provides links to common tasks for working with builds in AWS CodeBuild.", "this_doc_product": "AWS CodeBuild", "this_doc_guide": "User Guide", "favicon": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/assets/images/favicon.ico", "target_state": "builds-working", "pdf": "/pdfs/codebuild/latest/userguide/codebuild-user.pdf#builds-working", "deployment_region": "IAD", "rss": "aws-codebuild-user-guide-updates.rss", "scrapeId": "5a7edf82-28ba-476b-bc32-703c72e5e780", "sourceURL": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/codebuild/latest/userguide/builds-working.html", "url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/codebuild/latest/userguide/builds-working.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

This helps maintain and improve the relevance of Amazon Personalize recommendations.\nYou can import more data with bulk or individual data import operations.\n\n- With individual imports, Amazon Personalize appends the new records to the dataset. To update an individual item, user, or action, you can import a record with the same ID but with the modified attributes. You can import up to 10 records per individual import operation.\n\nFor more information on importing records individually, see Importing individual records into an Amazon Personalize dataset. For information about recording real-time events, see Recording real-time events to influence recommendations.\n\n- With bulk imports, you add to or replace bulk data by creating another import job. By default, a dataset import job replaces any existing data in the dataset that you imported in bulk. You can instead append the new records to existing data by changing the job's import mode.\n\nTo append data to an Item interactions dataset or Action interactions dataset with a dataset import job, you must have at minimum 1000 new item interaction or action interaction records. Within 20 minutes of completing a bulk import, Amazon Personalize updates any filters you created in the dataset group with your new bulk data. This update allows Amazon Personalize to use the most recent data when filtering recommendations for your users.\n\nAfter you create an Items or Users dataset, you can replace its schema with a new or existing one. You might replace a dataset's schema if your data structure changed after you created the dataset. For example, you might have a new column of item metadata that you want Amazon Personalize to consider during training. Or you might want to add a column of data to use only when filtering recommendations. For more information, see Replacing a dataset's schema to add new columns.\n\nAfter you create a recommender or custom solution version, how new data influences recommendations depends on its type, the method of import, and the domain use case or custom recipe you use. The following sections explain how new data influences real-time and batch recommendations before the next training.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/personalize/latest/dg/updating-datasets.html", "title": "Updating data in datasets after training - Amazon Personalize", "description": "As your catalog grows, import additional training data into your datasets.

You can configure Amazon Redshift streaming ingestion on an Amazon Redshift cluster using SQL statements to authenticate and connect to an Amazon MSK topic.\n\nFor more information, see Streaming ingestion in the Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/msk/latest/developerguide/integrations-redshift.html", "title": "Amazon Redshift streaming data ingestion for Amazon MSK", "description": "Amazon Redshift supports streaming ingestion from Amazon MSK, providing low-latency, high-speed ingestion of streaming data into an Amazon Redshift materialized view.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 4, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 21:33:14", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"pdf": "/pdfs/msk/latest/developerguide/MSKDevGuide.pdf#integrations-redshift", "deployment_region": "IAD", "guide": "Developer Guide", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "guide-locale": "en_us", "tocs": "toc-contents.json", "abstract": "Developer guide for Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka.", "this_doc_guide": "Developer Guide", "favicon": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/assets/images/favicon.ico", "feedback-item": "msk", "rss": "amazon-msk-release-notes.rss", "feedback": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forms/aws-doc-feedback?hidden_service_name=msk&topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/msk/latest/developerguide/integrations-redshift.html", "feedback-no": "feedbackno.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/msk/latest/developerguide/integrations-redshift.html", "assets_root": "/assets", "language": "en-US", "feedback-yes": "feedbackyes.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/msk/latest/developerguide/integrations-redshift.html", "keywords": "Apache Kafka,Apache ZooKeeper,MSK,Amazon MSK,Broker,cluster,MSK cluster", "title": "Amazon Redshift streaming data ingestion for Amazon MSK - Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka", "this_doc_product": "Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka", "forums": "https://repost.aws/tags/TAhybM_7u2QN2GsWOc4aJVDg", "target_state": "integrations-redshift", "description": "Reference for Amazon MSK support for Amazon Redshift streaming data ingestion feature.", "product": "Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka", "default_state": "integrations-redshift", "scrapeId": "ad8634d6-2423-403d-bf2e-a6a473e64040", "sourceURL": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/msk/latest/developerguide/integrations-redshift.html", "url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/msk/latest/developerguide/integrations-redshift.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful AWS expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Share and Use an Amazon SageMaker Studio Classic Notebook\"?\n\nAssistant: This page covers how to share and use Amazon SageMaker Studio Classic notebooks, including permissions, sharing options, and real-time collaboration features.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Important\nCustom IAM policies that allow Amazon SageMaker Studio or Amazon SageMaker Studio Classic to create Amazon SageMaker resources must also grant permissions to add tags to those resources. The permission to add tags to resources is required because Studio and Studio Classic automatically tag any resources they create. If an IAM policy allows Studio and Studio Classic to create resources but does not allow tagging, \"AccessDenied\" errors can occur when trying to create resources. For more information, see Provide permissions for tagging SageMaker AI resources.\n\nAWS managed policies for Amazon SageMaker AI that give permissions to create SageMaker resources already include permissions to add tags while creating those resources.\n\nAs of November 30, 2023, the previous Amazon SageMaker Studio experience is now named Amazon SageMaker Studio Classic. The following section is specific to using the Studio Classic application. For information about using the updated Studio experience, see Amazon SageMaker Studio.\n\n## Share a Notebook\nYou can share your Amazon SageMaker Studio Classic notebooks with your colleagues. The shared notebook is a copy. After you share your notebook, any changes you make to your original notebook aren't reflected in the shared notebook and any changes your colleague's make in their shared copies of the notebook aren't reflected in your original notebook. If you want to share your latest version, you must create a new snapshot and then share it.\n\nTo share a notebook:\n1. In the upper-right corner of the notebook, choose **Share**.\n2. (Optional) In **Create shareable snapshot**, choose any of the following items:\n   - **Include Git repo information** – Includes a link to the Git repository that contains the notebook. This enables you and your colleague to collaborate and contribute to the same Git repository.\n   - **Include output** – Includes all notebook output that has been saved.\n3. Choose **Create**.\n4. After the snapshot is created, choose **Copy link** and then choose **Close**.\n5. Share the link with your colleague.\n\n## Use a Shared Notebook\nYou use a shared notebook in the same way you would with a notebook that you created yourself. You must first login to your account, then open the shared link. If you don't have an active session, you receive an error.\n\nWhen you choose a link to a shared notebook for the first time, a read-only version of the notebook opens. To edit the shared notebook, choose **Create a Copy**. This copies the shared notebook to your personal storage.\n\nThe copied notebook launches on an instance of the instance type and SageMaker AI image that the notebook was using when the sender shared it. If you aren't currently running an instance of the instance type, a new instance is started. Customization to the SageMaker AI image isn't shared. You can also inspect the notebook snapshot by choosing **Snapshot Details**.\n\n## Shared spaces and realtime collaboration\nA shared space consists of a shared JupyterServer application and a shared directory. A key benefit of a shared space is that it facilitates collaboration between members of the shared space in real time. Users collaborating in a workspace get access to a shared Studio Classic application where they can access, read, and edit their notebooks in real time. Real time collaboration is only supported for JupyterServer applications within a shared space. Users with access to a shared space can simultaneously open, view, edit, and execute Jupyter notebooks in the shared Studio Classic application in that space.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/sagemaker/latest/dg/notebooks-sharing.html", "title": "Share and Use an Amazon SageMaker Studio Classic Notebook", "description": "This page covers how to share and use Amazon SageMaker Studio Classic notebooks, including permissions, sharing options, and real-time collaboration features.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 4, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 21:34:03", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"feedback": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forms/aws-doc-feedback?hidden_service_name=SageMaker&topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/sagemaker/latest/dg/notebooks-sharing.html", "tocs": "toc-contents.json", "language": "en-US", "target_state": "notebooks-sharing", "favicon": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/assets/images/favicon.ico", "keywords": "SageMaker,Amazon SageMaker,machine learning,notebook instance,ml environments,supports,Interactive development environment,IDEs", "assets_root": "/assets", "deployment_region": "IAD", "guide-locale": "en_us", "this_doc_guide": "Developer Guide", "feedback-yes": "feedbackyes.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/sagemaker/latest/dg/notebooks-sharing.html", "forums": "https://repost.aws/tags/TAT80swPyVRPKPcA0rsJYPuA", "product": "Amazon SageMaker AI", "default_state": "notebooks-sharing", "title": "Share and Use an Amazon SageMaker Studio Classic Notebook - Amazon SageMaker AI", "description": "You can share your Amazon SageMaker Studio Classic notebooks with your colleagues.

This is often referred to as cross-account access. This section provides examples and step-by-step instructions for configuring cross-account access for a repository named MySharedDemoRepo in the US East (Ohio) Region in an AWS account (referred to as AccountA) to IAM users who belong to an IAM group named DevelopersWithCrossAccountRepositoryAccess in another AWS account (referred to as AccountB).\n\nThis section is divided into three parts:\n\n- Actions for the Administrator in AccountA.\n- Actions for the Administrator in AccountB.\n- Actions for the repository user in AccountB.\n\nTo configure cross-account access:\n\n- The administrator in AccountA signs in as an IAM user with the permissions required to create and manage repositories in CodeCommit and create roles in IAM. If you are using managed policies, apply IAMFullAccess and AWSCodeCommitFullAccess to this IAM user.\n\nThe example account ID for AccountA is 111122223333.\n\n- The administrator in AccountB signs in as an IAM user with the permissions required to create and manage IAM users and groups, and to configure policies for users and groups. If you are using managed policies, apply IAMFullAccess to this IAM user.\n\nThe example account ID for AccountB is 888888888888.\n\n- The repository user in AccountB, to emulate the activities of a developer, signs in as an IAM user who is a member of the IAM group created to allow access to the CodeCommit repository in AccountA. This account must be configured with:\n\n- AWS Management Console access.\n- An access key and secret key to use when connecting to AWS resources and the ARN of the role to assume when accessing repositories in AccountA.\n- The git-remote-codecommit utility on the local computer where the repository is cloned. This utility requires Python and its installer, pip.

Then you set up the `cqhsh-expansion` and AWS CloudShell. Alternatively you can use the AWS CLI to create resources in Amazon Keyspaces.\n\n- **Step 1: Create a keyspace and table** – In this section, you'll create a keyspace named \"catalog\" and a table named \"book_awards\" within it. You'll specify the table's columns, data types, partition key, and clustering column using the AWS Management Console, CQL, or the AWS CLI.\n\n- **Step 2: Perform CRUD operations** – Here, you'll use the `cqlsh-expansion` in CloudShell to insert, read, update, and delete data in the \"book_awards\" table. You'll learn how to use various CQL statements like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, and practice filtering and modifying data.\n\n- **Step 3: Clean up resources** – To avoid incurring charges for unused resources, this section guides you through deleting the \"book_awards\" table and \"catalog\" keyspace using the console, CQL, or the AWS CLI.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/keyspaces/latest/devguide/getting-started.html", "title": "Getting started with Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra)", "description": "This tutorial guides you through installing the necessary programs and tools to use Amazon Keyspaces successfully.

To see which arguments are optional, see the following descriptions.\n\n```nohighlight hljs\n\nwindowSum\n\t(\n\t     measure\n\t    , [sort_order_field ASC/DESC, ...]\n\t    , start_index\n\t    , end_index\n\t\t,[ partition_field, ... ]\n\t)\n```\n\n## Arguments\n_measure_\nThe aggregated metric that you want to get the sum for, for example `sum({Revenue})`.\n\nFor the engines MySQL, MariaDB, and Amazon Aurora with MySQL compatibility, the lookup index is limited to just 1. Window functions aren't supported for MySQL versions below 8 and MariaDB versions earlier than 10.2.\n\n_sort attribute_\nOne or more aggregated fields, either measures or dimensions or both, that you want to sort the data by, separated by commas. You can either specify ascending ( `ASC`) or descending ( `DESC`) sort order.\n\nEach field in the list is enclosed in {} (curly braces), if it's more than one word. The entire list is enclosed in \\[ \\] (square brackets).\n\n_start index_\nThe start index is a positive integer, indicating _n_ rows above the current row. The start index counts the available data points above the current row, rather than counting actual time periods. If your data is sparse (missing months or years, for example), adjust the indexes accordingly.\n\n_end index_\nThe end index is a positive integer, indicating _n_ rows below the current row. The end index counts the available data points below the current row, rather than counting actual time periods. If your data is sparse (missing months or years, for example), adjust the indexes accordingly.\n\n_partition field_\n(Optional) One or more dimensions that you want to partition by, separated by commas.\n\nEach field in the list is enclosed in {} (curly braces), if it's more than one word. The entire list is enclosed in \\[ \\] (square brackets).\n\n## Example\nThe following example calculates the moving sum of `sum(Revenue)`, sorted by `SaleDate`. The calculation includes two rows above and one row ahead of the current row.\n\n```hljs sql\n\nwindowSum\n\t(\n\t     sum(Revenue),\n\t     [SaleDate ASC],\n\t     2,\n\t    1\n\t)\n```\n\nThe following example show a trailing 12-month sum.\n\n```hljs sql\n\nwindowSum(sum(Revenue),[SaleDate ASC],12,0)\n```\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/quicksight/latest/user/windowSum-function.html", "title": "windowSum - Amazon QuickSight", "description": "The windowSum function calculates the sum of the aggregated measure in a custom window that is partitioned and sorted by specified attributes.

The following section is specific to using the Studio Classic application. For information about using the updated Studio experience, see Amazon SageMaker Studio.\n\n## Benefits of Using Studio Classic Notebooks\nWhen you're starting a new notebook, we recommend that you create the notebook in Amazon SageMaker Studio Classic instead of launching a notebook instance from the Amazon SageMaker AI console. There are many benefits to using a Studio Classic notebook, including the following:\n\n- **Faster:** Starting a Studio Classic notebook is faster than launching an instance-based notebook. Typically, it is 5-10 times faster than instance-based notebooks.\n- **Easy notebook sharing:** Notebook sharing is an integrated feature in Studio Classic. Users can generate a shareable link that reproduces the notebook code and also the SageMaker AI image required to execute it, in just a few clicks.\n- **Latest Python SDK:** Studio Classic notebooks come pre-installed with the latest Amazon SageMaker Python SDK.\n- **Access all Studio Classic features:** Studio Classic notebooks are accessed from within Studio Classic. This enables you to build, train, debug, track, and monitor your models without leaving Studio Classic.\n- **Persistent user directories:** Each member of a Studio team gets their own home directory to store their notebooks and other files. The directory is automatically mounted onto all instances and kernels as they're started, so their notebooks and other files are always available. The home directories are stored in Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) so that you can access them from other services.\n- **Direct access:** When using IAM Identity Center, you use your IAM Identity Center credentials through a unique URL to directly access Studio Classic. You don't have to interact with the AWS Management Console to run your notebooks.\n- **Optimized images:** Studio Classic notebooks are equipped with a set of predefined SageMaker AI image settings to get you started faster.\n\n## Note\nStudio Classic notebooks don't support local mode. However, you can use a notebook instance to train a sample of your dataset locally, and then use the same code in a Studio Classic notebook to train on the full dataset.\n\n## User Interface\nWhen you open a notebook in SageMaker Studio Classic, the view is an extension of the JupyterLab interface. The primary features are the same, so you'll find the typical features of a Jupyter notebook and JupyterLab.\n\n## Related resources\n- [Amazon SageMaker AI API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html)\n- [AWS CLI commands for Amazon SageMaker AI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sagemaker/)\n- [SDKs & Tools](https://aws.amazon.com/tools/)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/sagemaker/latest/dg/notebooks-comparison.html", "title": "How Are Amazon SageMaker Studio Classic Notebooks Different from Notebook Instances?", "description": "This page explains the differences between Amazon SageMaker Studio Classic notebooks and traditional notebook instances, highlighting the benefits of using Studio Classic.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 8, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 21:37:42", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"feedback-yes": "feedbackyes.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/sagemaker/latest/dg/notebooks-comparison.html", "target_state": "notebooks-comparison", "abstract": "Use SageMaker AI to build, train, and host machine learning models in AWS.", "tocs": "toc-contents.json", "feedback-item": "SageMaker", "guide-locale": "en_us", "keywords": "SageMaker,Amazon SageMaker,machine learning,notebook instance,ml environments,supports,Interactive development environment,IDEs", "deployment_region": "IAD", "feedback-no": "feedbackno.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/sagemaker/latest/dg/notebooks-comparison.html", "language": "en-US", "default_state": "notebooks-comparison", "this_doc_guide": "Developer Guide", "forums": "https://repost.aws/tags/TAT80swPyVRPKPcA0rsJYPuA", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "When you're starting a new notebook, we recommend that you create the notebook in Amazon SageMaker Studio Classic instead of launching a notebook instance from the Amazon SageMaker AI console.

A Boolean value must be either `true` or `false`.\n\n```bash\n'123'        # Integer\n'123.12'     # Decimal\n'hello'      # String\n'true'       # Boolean\n```\n\n**Reference**\nFor references, you must specify either variables or input values.\n\n- The following input references a decimal number, `10.01`.\n\n```bash\n$input.GreenhouseInput.temperature\n```\n\n- The following variable references a string, `Greenhouse Temperature Table`.\n\n```bash\n$variable.TableName\n```\n\n**Substitution template**\nFor a substitution template, you must use `${}`, and the template must be in single quotes. A substitution template can also contain a combination of literals, operators, functions, references, and substitution templates.\n\n- The evaluated result of the following expression is a string, `50.018 in Fahrenheit`.\n\n```bash\n'${$input.GreenhouseInput.temperature * 9 / 5 + 32} in Fahrenheit'\n```\n\n- The evaluated result of the following expression is a string, `{\"sensor_id\":\"Sensor_1\",\"temperature\":\"50.018\"}`.\n\n```bash\n'{\"sensor_id\":\"${$input.GreenhouseInput.sensors[0].sensor1}\",\"temperature\":\"${$input.GreenhouseInput.temperature*9/5+32}\"}'\n```\n\n**String concatenation**\nFor a string concatenation, you must use `+`. A string concatenation can also contain a combination of literals, operators, functions, references, and substitution templates.\n\n- The evaluated result of the following expression is a string, `Greenhouse Temperature Table 2000-01-01`.\n\n```bash\n'Greenhouse Temperature Table ' + $input.GreenhouseInput.date\n```\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/iotevents/latest/developerguide/expression-usage.html", "title": "Expression examples and usage for AWS IoT Events", "description": "This page provides examples and usage guidelines for writing expressions in AWS IoT Events.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 5, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 21:38:03", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"guide": "Developer Guide", "this_doc_product": "AWS IoT Events", "keywords": "AWS IoT Events expressions,filter AWS IoT Events data,process AWS IoT Events data,AWS IoT Events expression usage,AWS IoT Events expression examples,AWS IoT Events filter data,transform AWS IoT Events data", "favicon": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/assets/images/favicon.ico", "language": "en-US", "tocs": "toc-contents.json", "feedback-no": "feedbackno.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/iotevents/latest/developerguide/expression-usage.html", "title": "Expression examples and usage for AWS IoT Events - AWS IoT Events", "feedback-item": "IoT Events", "abstract": "Describes how to use the service to monitor your equipment or device fleets for failures or changes in operation, and to trigger actions when such events occur.", "forums": "https://repost.aws/tags/TANsxSwnClQ_Wfh-uklXi7hQ", "guide-locale": "en_us", "target_state": "expression-usage", "this_doc_guide": "Developer Guide", "rss": "aws-iot-events-doc-history.rss", "description": "Guidelines and examples for using expressions in AWS IoT Events to filter, transform, and process event data.", "product": "AWS IoT Events", "default_state": "expression-usage", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "deployment_region": "IAD", "assets_root": "/assets", "pdf": "/pdfs/iotevents/latest/developerguide/iotevents-dg.pdf#expression-usage", "feedback": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forms/aws-doc-feedback?hidden_service_name=IoT%20Events&topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/iotevents/latest/developerguide/expression-usage.html", "feedback-yes": "feedbackyes.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/iotevents/latest/developerguide/expression-usage.html", "scrapeId": "63055a85-6786-486f-be53-9a8b0bfd94cf", "sourceURL": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/iotevents/latest/developerguide/expression-usage.html", "url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/iotevents/latest/developerguide/expression-usage.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

You can use this command instead of executing a large number of `INSERT` statements, `addV` and `addE` steps, or other API calls.\n\nThe Neptune **Loader** command is faster, has less overhead, is optimized for large datasets, and supports both Gremlin data and the RDF (Resource Description Framework) data used by SPARQL.\n\nThe following diagram shows an overview of the load process:\n\nHere are the steps of the loading process:\n\n1. Copy the data files to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket.\n2. Create an IAM role with Read and List access to the bucket.\n3. Create an Amazon S3 VPC endpoint.\n4. Start the Neptune loader by sending a request via HTTP to the Neptune DB instance.\n5. The Neptune DB instance assumes the IAM role to load the data from the bucket.\n\n**Note**: You can load encrypted data from Amazon S3 if it was encrypted using either the Amazon S3 `SSE-S3` or the `SSE-KMS` mode, provided that the role you use for bulk load has access to the Amazon S3 object, and also in the case of SSE-KMS, to `kms:decrypt`. Neptune can then impersonate your credentials and issue `s3:getObject` calls on your behalf. However, Neptune does not currently support loading data encrypted using the `SSE-C` mode.\n\n## Topics\n- [Prerequisites: IAM Role and Amazon S3 Access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/neptune/latest/userguide/bulk-load-tutorial-IAM.html)\n- [Load Data Formats](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/neptune/latest/userguide/bulk-load-tutorial-format.html)\n- [Example: Loading Data into a Neptune DB Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/neptune/latest/userguide/bulk-load-data.html)\n- [Optimizing an Amazon Neptune bulk load](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/neptune/latest/userguide/bulk-load-optimize.html)\n- [Neptune Loader Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/neptune/latest/userguide/load-api-reference.html)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/neptune/latest/userguide/bulk-load.html", "title": "Using the Amazon Neptune bulk loader to ingest data", "description": "This page provides instructions on how to use the Amazon Neptune bulk loader to ingest data from external files directly into a Neptune DB cluster.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 5, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 21:38:20", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"rss": "rssupdates.rss", "language": "en-US", "guide": "User Guide", "forums": "https://repost.aws/tags/TAxVAEdWg1SrS0lClUSX-m_Q", "assets_root": "/assets", "default_state": "bulk-load", "favicon": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/assets/images/favicon.ico", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Overview of how to load data from external files into a Neptune DB instance using the Neptune bulk loader.", "keywords": "Neptune Graph database,Amazon Neptune Graph database,Graph,Graph database,Database,SPARQL,Gremlin,Cypher,openCypher,bulk load Amazon Neptune,Neptune bulk load GraphMappingConfig,replicating to Neptune,AWS DMS replication tasks with Neptune", "feedback-item": "Neptune", "feedback": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forms/aws-doc-feedback?hidden_service_name=Neptune&topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/neptune/latest/userguide/bulk-load.html", "title": "Using the Amazon Neptune bulk loader to ingest data - Amazon Neptune", "guide-locale": "en_us", "tocs": "toc-contents.json", "pdf": "/pdfs/neptune/latest/userguide/neptune-ug.pdf#bulk-load", "deployment_region": "IAD", "product": "Amazon Neptune", "this_doc_product": "Amazon Neptune", "this_doc_guide": "User Guide", "abstract": "Amazon Neptune is a fast, reliable, fully managed graph database service that makes it easy to build and run applications that work with highly connected datasets.", "target_state": "bulk-load", "feedback-no": "feedbackno.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/neptune/latest/userguide/bulk-load.html", "feedback-yes": "feedbackyes.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/neptune/latest/userguide/bulk-load.html", "scrapeId": "845a22b3-8c3b-47b2-b995-0afbd4bdb72c", "sourceURL": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/neptune/latest/userguide/bulk-load.html", "url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/neptune/latest/userguide/bulk-load.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

The tutorials use historical data that consists of 100,000 movie ratings on 9,700 movies from 600 users.\n\nTo simplify tutorials:\n\n- We use a small dataset. This might negatively impact any metrics generated by resources. The tutorials serve as an introduction to the Amazon Personalize workflow and won't necessarily generate the highest performing models.\n\n- We create only an Item interactions dataset, and rely on the fact that a user saw a movie and not on what they rated the movie. This simplifies the preparation of the training data.\n\n- We don't record live user interaction events. For information on capturing user events, see Recording real-time events to influence recommendations.\n\nYou can choose to get started with a Domain dataset group or a Custom dataset group:\n\n- Domain dataset groups provide resources that are optimized for different use cases based on your domain. To get started creating a Domain dataset group, complete the Getting started prerequisites and then complete the tutorial in Getting started with a Domain dataset group.\n\n- Custom dataset groups allow you to create and configure only custom resources. To get started providing personalized movie recommendations for your users with a custom resources and the User-Personalization-v2 recipe, complete the Getting started prerequisites and then start the tutorials in Getting started with a Custom dataset group.\n\nWhen you finish the getting started exercise, to avoid incurring unnecessary charges, delete the resources that you created.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful AWS expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Categories for inputs\"?\n\nAssistant: In MediaLive, inputs can be categorized in several ways.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Type\nAn input has a type of source and delivery protocol. For example, an HLS input or an RTMP input. For more information, see Input types supported in MediaLive.\n\n## Live versus VOD\nAn input is either a live (streaming) input or a video on demand (VOD) input. For more information, see Input types supported in MediaLive.\n\n## Push versus pull\nAn input is either a push input or a pull input.\n\nWith a push input, the upstream system pushes the input to endpoints on MediaLive. The input holds these endpoints.\n\nWith a pull input, MediaLive pulls the input from the upstream system. The input holds these source addresses on the upstream system.\n\n## Input class\nAn input can be set up as either a standard-class input or single-class input:\n\nYou can use a standard-class input with a standard channel or a single-pipeline channel.\n\nYou can use a single-class input only with a single-pipeline channel.\n\n## Static versus dynamic\nWhen you create the input, you decide if it is static or dynamic.\n\nA static input has a URL (that points to the content source) that never changes. Any input type can be set up as a static input.\n\nA dynamic input has a URL that includes a variable portion. It is intended for use with input switching. Only MP4 and Transport Stream (TS) inputs can be set up as dynamic inputs.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/medialive/latest/ug/input-categories.html", "title": "Categories for inputs", "description": "In MediaLive, inputs can be categorized in several ways.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 5, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 21:40:32", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"forums": "https://repost.aws/tags/TAQT5TNwtgSqeM9NCSKfOJPQ", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "default_state": "input-categories", "deployment_region": "IAD", "this_doc_product": "MediaLive", "this_doc_guide": "User Guide", "pdf": "/pdfs/medialive/latest/ug/medialive-ug.pdf#input-categories", "product": "MediaLive", "feedback": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forms/aws-doc-feedback?hidden_service_name=MediaLive&topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/medialive/latest/ug/input-categories.html", "description": "In MediaLive, inputs can be categorized in several ways:", "tocs": "toc-contents.json", "guide": "User Guide", "target_state": "input-categories", "feedback-item": "MediaLive", "feedback-yes": "feedbackyes.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/medialive/latest/ug/input-categories.html", "keywords": "MediaLive,AWS Elemental MediaLive,streaming,live streaming video,video compression,video,live,broadcast,media service", "language": "en-US", "rss": "medialive-documentation-updates.rss", "title": "Categories for inputs - MediaLive", "abstract": "Use MediaLive to create live outputs for broadcast and streaming delivery.

The device will install software updates some time in the next two hours.\n\nYou don't have to stop either the device or the channels before starting a maintenance window. MediaLive handles the update smoothly.\n\n###### To start a maintenance window for a device\n1. Open the MediaLive console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/medialive/.\n2. In the navigation pane, choose **Input devices**. Find the card for the Link that you want to update, and choose the hyperlink.\n3. On the **Device details** page for the device, choose **Other** device actions then **Start** maintenance, then confirm the request.\n\nThe maintenance window starts. The update will start some time during the next two hours. When the update starts, any channels that are using the device will lose input briefly, but the channels won't stop or fail.\n\nWhen the reboot is complete, the device connection status changes to **Connected**. If the device was streaming prior to the reboot, it automatically resumes streaming output.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/medialive/latest/ug/device-update.html", "title": "Select your cookie preferences", "description": "This page allows users to select their cookie preferences for the AWS site, detailing the types of cookies used and options for customization.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 4, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 21:40:49", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"tocs": "toc-contents.json", "target_state": "device-update", "pdf": "/pdfs/medialive/latest/ug/medialive-ug.pdf#device-update", "feedback": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forms/aws-doc-feedback?hidden_service_name=MediaLive&topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/medialive/latest/ug/device-update.html", "product": "MediaLive", "abstract": "Use MediaLive to create live outputs for broadcast and streaming delivery.

If you do not allow these cookies, then some or all of these services may not function properly.\n\n## Advertising\nAdvertising cookies may be set through our site by us or our advertising partners and help us deliver relevant marketing content. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less relevant advertising.\n\n## Blocking cookies\nBlocking some types of cookies may impact your experience of our sites. You may review and change your choices at any time by selecting Cookie preferences in the footer of this site. We and selected third-parties use cookies or similar technologies as specified in the AWS Cookie Notice.\n\n## Unable to save cookie preferences\nWe will only store essential cookies at this time, because we were unable to save your cookie preferences. If you want to change your cookie preferences, try again later using the link in the AWS console footer, or contact support if the problem persists.\n\n## Supported inputs\nTo use the workflow wizard, you must ingest a single source from one of the following: - A flow in AWS Elemental MediaConnect. - Content from an AWS Elemental Link hardware device. - Content from a mobile phone or webcam. The source is delivered using the RTMP protocol. - An MP4 file stored on Amazon S3 or an HTTP server.\n\n## Supported outputs\nWith the workflow wizard, you can extract one video asset and one audio asset from the source and convert it to one or more of the following types of output: - Output to send to an AWS Elemental MediaPackage channel, for delivery to Amazon CloudFront. CloudFront distributes the content to your end users. - Output to send to an AWS Elemental MediaStore container, for delivery to CloudFront. CloudFront distributes the content to your end users. - Output to Facebook, Twitch, or YouTube.\n\n## Low-touch setup\nThe workflow wizard automatically performs as much setup as possible in the upstream system. For example, your source might be in MediaConnect but you might not have created the flow. In this case, the workflow wizard automatically creates the flow for you. The workflow wizard also automatically performs as much setup as possible in the downstream system or systems. For example, you might be sending to MediaPackage, but you might not have created the MediaPackage channel and might not have set up CloudFront. In this case, the workflow wizard performs the setup in those services. The workflow wizard works best when you use it to create these resources, rather than using existing resources.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/medialive/latest/ug/wizard-about.html", "title": "Select your cookie preferences", "description": "This page allows users to customize their cookie preferences for the AWS site, detailing the types of cookies used and their purposes.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 10, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 21:42:52", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"assets_root": "/assets", "feedback-item": "MediaLive", "guide-locale": "en_us", "favicon": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/assets/images/favicon.ico", "default_state": "wizard-about", "this_doc_guide": "User Guide", "feedback": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forms/aws-doc-feedback?hidden_service_name=MediaLive&topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/medialive/latest/ug/wizard-about.html", "feedback-yes": "feedbackyes.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/medialive/latest/ug/wizard-about.html", "keywords": "MediaLive,AWS Elemental MediaLive,streaming,live streaming video,video compression,video,live,broadcast,media service", "pdf": "/pdfs/medialive/latest/ug/medialive-ug.pdf#wizard-about", "language": "en-US", "this_doc_product": "MediaLive", "abstract": "Use MediaLive to create live outputs for broadcast and streaming delivery.

You can also access a dashboard if it's embedded into an application or website that you already have access to. When you open the dashboard, the screen should look something like the following example.\n\nTo fit the dashboard to your screen, open the **View** menu at upper right and select **Fit to window**.\n\nDepending on how the dashboard is configured, you can find all or some of the following elements:\n\n- The menu bar – This displays the name of the dashboard. Also, the menu bar shows what you can do with the dashboard, including **Undo**, **Redo**, and **Reset**, on the left. As you interact with the dashboard, you can use these as tools to help you explore, knowing that you can change your view without losing anything. On the right, you can find options to **Print** the dashboard, work with **Data**, choose a different AWS **Region**, and open your **User** **Profile**. The user profile menu has options so you can choose the language that Amazon QuickSight displays. It also has links to the Amazon QuickSight **Community** and the online documentation ( **Help**).\n\n- The dashboard sheets – If your dashboard has multiple sheets, these display as tabs across the top of the dashboard.\n\n- The **Filter** menu – This option displays to the left of the dashboard, if the dashboard publisher allows filtering.\n\n- The **Controls** palette – If your dashboard includes controls, you can use them to choose the options (parameters) that you want to apply to your dashboard. Sometimes a control value is selected for you, and sometimes it's set to **ALL**.\n\n- The dashboard title – If your dashboard has a title, it is usually a larger heading. It might have some status information or instructions below it.\n\n- The dashboard widgets – The items on the screen can include charts, graphs, insights, narratives, or images. To see them all, you might need to scroll vertically or horizontally.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/quicksight/latest/user/exploring-dashboards.html", "title": "Interacting with Amazon QuickSight dashboards", "description": "This page provides guidance on how to interact with Amazon QuickSight dashboards, including cookie preferences and dashboard features.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 4, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 21:43:47", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"abstract": "The Amazon QuickSight user guide contains how-to topics, and guides for creating data analyses, visualizations, and dashboards.", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "target_state": "exploring-dashboards", "deployment_region": "IAD", "default_state": "exploring-dashboards", "assets_root": "/assets", "rss": "amazon-quicksight-doc-release-notes.rss", "forums": "https://repost.aws/tags/TAtoF6BGmuRdGfw2e14IBwEQ", "keywords": "data analysis,data insights,data visualization,dataviz,graphical data analysis,Amazon QuickSight,access quicksight report,author mode,author view,author,canned reports,dashboard on website,dashboards,data dashboards,embedded dashboard,embedding dashboard,export data,filter data,open shared dashboard,quicksight embedded dashboard,quicksight reader,quicksight viewer,reader mode,reader view,reader,reports,see data,shared dashboard,sort data,subscribe dashboard,use dashboard on website,use dashboard,use quicksight,view data", "this_doc_guide": "User Guide", "this_doc_product": "Amazon QuickSight", "language": "en-US", "pdf": "/pdfs/quicksight/latest/user/amazon-quicksight-user.pdf#exploring-dashboards", "guide": "User Guide", "tocs": "toc-contents.json", "feedback-item": "QuickSight", "feedback-yes": "feedbackyes.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/quicksight/latest/user/exploring-dashboards.html", "favicon": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/assets/images/favicon.ico", "description": "Learn how to explore a data dashboard as a subscriber in Amazon QuickSight.", "feedback": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forms/aws-doc-feedback?hidden_service_name=QuickSight&topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/quicksight/latest/user/exploring-dashboards.html", "product": "Amazon QuickSight", "feedback-no": "feedbackno.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/quicksight/latest/user/exploring-dashboards.html", "title": "Interacting with Amazon QuickSight dashboards - Amazon QuickSight", "guide-locale": "en_us", "scrapeId": "07321973-a5b2-4b72-a675-2728e473d1a0", "sourceURL": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/quicksight/latest/user/exploring-dashboards.html", "url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/quicksight/latest/user/exploring-dashboards.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

We and selected third-parties use cookies or similar technologies as specified in the AWS Cookie Notice.\n\n## Unable to save cookie preferences\nWe will only store essential cookies at this time, because we were unable to save your cookie preferences.\n\nIf you want to change your cookie preferences, try again later using the link in the AWS console footer, or contact support if the problem persists.\n\n## Syntax\nThe brackets are required. To see which arguments are optional, see the following descriptions.\n\n```nohighlight hljs\n\nminOver\n(\n     measure\n     ,[ partition_field, ... ]\n     ,calculation level\n)\n```\n\n## Arguments\n_measure_\nThe measure that you want to do the calculation for, for example `sum({Sales Amt})`. Use an aggregation if the calculation level is set to `NULL` or `POST_AGG_FILTER`. Don't use an aggregation if the calculation level is set to `PRE_FILTER` or `PRE_AGG`.\n\n_partition field_\n(Optional) One or more dimensions that you want to partition by, separated by commas.\n\nEach field in the list is enclosed in {} (curly braces), if it is more than one word. The entire list is enclosed in \\[ \\] (square brackets).\n\n_calculation level_\n(Optional) Specifies the calculation level to use:\n\n- `PRE_FILTER` – Prefilter calculations are computed before the dataset filters.\n- `PRE_AGG` – Preaggregate calculations are computed before applying aggregations and top and bottom _N_ filters to the visuals.\n- `POST_AGG_FILTER` – (Default) Table calculations are computed when the visuals display.\n\nThis value defaults to `POST_AGG_FILTER` when blank. For more information, see [Using level-aware calculations in Amazon QuickSight](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/quicksight/latest/user/level-aware-calculations.html).\n\n## Example\nThe following example calculates the min `sum(Sales)`, partitioned by `City` and `State`.\n\n```hljs sql\n\nminOver\n(\n     sum(Sales),\n     [City, State]\n)\n```\n\nThe following example shows the minimum `Billed Amount` over `Customer Region`. The fields in the table calculation are in the field wells of the visual.\n\n```hljs nginx\n\nminOver\n(\n     sum({Billed Amount}),\n     [{Customer Region}]\n)\n```\n\nThe following screenshot shows the results of the example. With the addition of `Service Line`, the total amount billed for each is displayed, and the minimum of these three values displays in the calculated field.\n\n## Related resources\n[Amazon QuickSight](https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight/)\n\n[Technical support](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home?#/case/create?issueType=technical&serviceCode=amazon-quicksight)\n\n[Amazon QuickSight user forum](https://answers.quicksight.aws.amazon.com/sn/index.html)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/quicksight/latest/user/minOver-function.html", "title": "minOver - Amazon QuickSight", "description": "The minOver function calculates the minimum of a measure or date partitioned by a list of dimensions.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 7, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 21:44:19", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"rss": "amazon-quicksight-doc-release-notes.rss", "tocs": "toc-contents.json", "title": "minOver - Amazon QuickSight", "target_state": "minOver-function", "this_doc_guide": "User Guide", "product": "Amazon QuickSight", "assets_root": "/assets", "abstract": "The Amazon QuickSight user guide contains how-to topics, and guides for creating data analyses, visualizations, and dashboards.", "forums": "https://repost.aws/tags/TAtoF6BGmuRdGfw2e14IBwEQ", "feedback": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forms/aws-doc-feedback?hidden_service_name=QuickSight&topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/quicksight/latest/user/minOver-function.html", "feedback-yes": "feedbackyes.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/quicksight/latest/user/minOver-function.html", "feedback-no": "feedbackno.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/quicksight/latest/user/minOver-function.html", "default_state": "minOver-function", "guide": "User Guide", "keywords": "data analysis,data insights,data visualization,dataviz,graphical data analysis,Amazon QuickSight", "guide-locale": "en_us", "description": "The minOver function calculates the minimum of a measure or date partitioned by a list of dimensions.", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "this_doc_product": "Amazon QuickSight", "deployment_region": "IAD", "language": "en-US", "feedback-item": "QuickSight", "favicon": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/assets/images/favicon.ico", "pdf": "/pdfs/quicksight/latest/user/amazon-quicksight-user.pdf#minOver-function", "scrapeId": "85214222-2cce-4c7a-9a42-23f08d8ccdc6", "sourceURL": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/quicksight/latest/user/minOver-function.html", "url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/quicksight/latest/user/minOver-function.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

For example, if your Report path prefix is example-report-prefix/example-report-name, then choose the folder named example-report-name. 8. Open the folder named with the latest billing period (in the YYYYMMDD-YYYYMMDD format). 9. Open the example-report-name-Manifest.json file. 10. At the top of the manifest file, note the assemblyId. The assemblyId value corresponds to the name of the folder with the latest report files. 11. Return to the Amazon S3 console page where you’re viewing the folder named with the latest billing period. 12. Open the folder named with the assemblyId value that you noted in step 10. For example, if the assemblyId value is 20210129T123456Z, then open the folder named 20210129T123456Z/. This folder contains your latest report files.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/cur/latest/userguide/view-latest-cur.html", "title": "Select your cookie preferences", "description": "This page allows users to customize their cookie preferences for the AWS site, detailing the types of cookies used and their purposes.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 8, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 21:47:14", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"target_state": "view-latest-cur", "this_doc_guide": "User Guide", "abstract": "Describes how to use the AWS Data Exports feature, integrated with the AWS Billing and Cost Management console.", "tocs": "toc-contents.json", "description": "Learn how to view your latest report version.", "guide-locale": "en_us", "feedback-item": "CostandUsageReport", "favicon": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/assets/images/favicon.ico", "language": "en-US", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "this_doc_product": "AWS Data Exports", "forums": "https://repost.aws/", "feedback": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forms/aws-doc-feedback?hidden_service_name=CostandUsageReport&topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/cur/latest/userguide/view-latest-cur.html", "assets_root": "/assets", "feedback-yes": "feedbackyes.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/cur/latest/userguide/view-latest-cur.html", "feedback-no": "feedbackno.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/cur/latest/userguide/view-latest-cur.html", "keywords": "AWS Cost and Usage Reports,Cost and Usage Reports,AWS CUR,CUR,Detailed Billing Report,Billing and Cost Management,AWS Billing Reports,Legacy Cost and Usage Reports,Legacy CUR,Data Exports,Manage Cost and Usage Reports,View Cost and Usage Reports,Cost and Usage Reports version,Cost and Usage Reports overwrite", "pdf": "/pdfs/cur/latest/userguide/cur-user-guide.pdf#view-latest-cur", "title": "Viewing the latest report version - AWS Data Exports", "deployment_region": "IAD", "guide": "User Guide", "default_state": "view-latest-cur", "rss": "cur-user-guide.rss", "product": "AWS Data Exports", "scrapeId": "5d6ff87c-c9b6-469f-975a-5a25ae81ee97", "sourceURL": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/cur/latest/userguide/view-latest-cur.html", "url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/cur/latest/userguide/view-latest-cur.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

As a provider, AWS Data Exchange eliminates the need to build and maintain any data delivery, entitlement, or billing technology. Providers in AWS Data Exchange have a secure, transparent, and reliable channel to reach AWS customers and grant existing customers their subscriptions more efficiently. The process for becoming an AWS Data Exchange provider requires a few steps to determine eligibility.\n\nA data product has the following parts:\n\n- **Product details** – This information helps potential subscribers understand what the product is. This includes a name, descriptions (both short and long), a logo image, and support contact information. Product details are filled out by providers.\n\n- **Product offers** – In order to make a product available on AWS Data Exchange, providers must define a public offer. This includes the prices and durations, data subscription agreement, refund policy, and the option to create custom offers.\n\n- **Data sets** – A product can contain one or more data sets. A data set is a dynamic set of file-based data content. Data sets are dynamic and are versioned using revisions. Each revision can contain multiple assets.\n\nFor more information, including eligibility requirements, see Providing data products on AWS Data Exchange in the AWS Data Exchange User Guide.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/marketplace/latest/userguide/data-products.html", "title": "Data products - AWS Marketplace", "description": "AWS Data Exchange is a service that makes it easy for AWS customers to securely exchange file-based data sets in the AWS Cloud.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 4, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 21:49:10", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"default_state": "data-products", "forums": "https://repost.aws/tags/TAFKxFgxoLQk2cQrIl7gtGOQ", "feedback": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forms/aws-doc-feedback?hidden_service_name=Marketplace&topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/marketplace/latest/userguide/data-products.html", "keywords": "AWS Marketplace,seller guide,SaaS,server,AMI,CloudFormation", "description": "Information about your data products in AWS Marketplace and on AWS Data Exchange", "assets_root": "/assets", "deployment_region": "IAD", "feedback-item": "Marketplace", "pdf": "/pdfs/marketplace/latest/userguide/aws-marketplace-ug.pdf#data-products", "tocs": "toc-contents.json", "guide": "Seller Guide", "language": "en-US", "target_state": "data-products", "title": "Data products - AWS Marketplace", "feedback-no": "feedbackno.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/marketplace/latest/userguide/data-products.html", "favicon": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/assets/images/favicon.ico", "feedback-yes": "feedbackyes.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/marketplace/latest/userguide/data-products.html", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "product": "AWS Marketplace", "this_doc_product": "AWS Marketplace", "this_doc_guide": "Seller Guide", "abstract": "Describes how to use AWS Marketplace to list your products that run on Amazon Web Services products and services.", "guide-locale": "en_us", "rss": "document-history.rss", "scrapeId": "041ada9b-b905-48bd-a779-ad9cc4d1d94b", "sourceURL": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/marketplace/latest/userguide/data-products.html", "url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/marketplace/latest/userguide/data-products.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

You may review and change your choices at any time by selecting Cookie preferences in the footer of this site. We and selected third-parties use cookies or similar technologies as specified in the AWS Cookie Notice.\n\n## Unable to save cookie preferences\nWe will only store essential cookies at this time, because we were unable to save your cookie preferences.\n\nIf you want to change your cookie preferences, try again later using the link in the AWS console footer, or contact support if the problem persists.\n\n## Perform a node task with Systems Manager\nUse this tutorial to get started with AWS Systems Manager. You'll learn how to launch an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance that is managed by Systems Manager, and how to connect to the managed instance.\n\nBecause Systems Manager is a collection of multiple tools, no single walkthrough or tutorial can introduce the entire service. This tutorial provides an introduction to some of the tools.\n\n## Prerequisites\nBefore you begin, be sure that you've completed the steps in Managing EC2 instances with Systems Manager.\n\n## Launch an instance using an AMI with SSM Agent preinstalled\nYou can launch an Amazon EC2 instance using the AWS Management Console as described in the following procedure. This tutorial is intended to help you launch your first managed instance quickly, so it doesn't cover all possible options.\n\nTo launch an instance:\n\n1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.\n2. From the EC2 console dashboard, in the Launch instance box, choose Launch instance, and then choose Launch instance from the options that appear.\n3. For Name and tags, for Name, enter a descriptive name for your instance.\n4. For Application and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image), do the following:\n   - Choose the Quick Start tab, and then choose Amazon Linux.\n   - For Amazon Machine Image (AMI), choose an HVM version of Amazon Linux 2.\n5. For Instance type, from the Instance type list, choose the hardware configuration for your instance. Choose the `t2.micro` instance type, which is selected by default. The `t2.micro` instance type is eligible for the AWS Free Tier. In AWS Regions where `t2.micro` is unavailable, you can use a `t3.micro` instance under the Free Tier. For more information, see AWS Free Tier.\n6. For Key pair (login), for Key pair name, choose a key pair.\n7. For Network settings, choose Edit. For Security group name, notice that the wizard created and selected a security group for you. You can use this security group, or alternatively you can select a security group that you created previously using the following steps:\n   - Choose Select existing security group.\n   - From Common security groups, choose your security group from the list of existing security groups.\n8. If you aren't using Default Host Management Configuration, expand the Advanced details section, and for IAM instance profile, choose the instance profile that you created when getting set up in Configure instance permissions required for Systems Manager.\n9. Keep the default selections for the other configuration settings for your instance.\n10. Review a summary of your instance configuration in the Summary pane. When you're ready, choose Launch instance.\n11. A confirmation page informs you that your instance is launching. Choose View all instances to close the confirmation page and return to the console.\n12. On the Instances screen, you can view the status of the launch. It takes a short time for an instance to launch.\n13. It can take a few minutes for the instance to show as managed and be ready for you to connect to it. To check that your instance passed its status checks, view this information in the Status check column.\n\n## Connect to your managed instance using Systems Manager\nTo connect to your managed instance:\n\n1. Open the AWS Systems Manager console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/.\n2. In the navigation pane, choose Fleet Manager.\n3. Choose the button next to the instance that you want to connect to.\n4. In the Node actions menu, choose Start terminal session.\n5. Select Connect.\n\n## Clean up your instance\nIf you're done working with the managed instance that you created for this tutorial, terminate it. Terminating an instance effectively deletes it.\n\nTo terminate your instance:\n\n1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.\n2. In the navigation pane, choose Instances. In the list of instances, select the instance.\n3. Choose Instance state, Terminate instance.\n4. Choose Terminate when prompted for confirmation.\n\nAmazon EC2 shuts down and terminates your instance. After your instance is terminated, it remains visible on the console briefly, and then the entry is deleted automatically. You can't remove the terminated instance from the console display yourself.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/systems-manager/latest/userguide/getting-started-launch-managed-instance.html", "title": "Select your cookie preferences", "description": "This page allows users to select their cookie preferences for the AWS site, including essential, performance, functional, and advertising cookies.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 8, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 21:50:21", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "this_doc_product": "AWS Systems Manager", "language": "en-US", "guide": "User Guide", "default_state": "getting-started-launch-managed-instance", "favicon": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/assets/images/favicon.ico", "feedback-no": "feedbackno.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/systems-manager/latest/userguide/getting-started-launch-managed-instance.html", "guide-locale": "en_us", "pdf": "/pdfs/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-ug.pdf#getting-started-launch-managed-instance", "target_state": "getting-started-launch-managed-instance", "assets_root": "/assets", "description": "Learn how to launch an Amazon EC2 instance managed by Systems Manager, and use various Systems Manager tools.", "deployment_region": "IAD", "keywords": "EC2 Systems Manager,Simple Systems Manager,SSM,Patch Manager,Parameter Store,Maintenance Window,Run Command,State Manager,Session Manager,SSM Agent,SSM Documents,Systems Manager,AWS Resource Groups,AppConfig,OpsCenter,Explorer,Change Calendar,Quick Setup,Change Manager,Fleet Manager", "title": "Perform a node task with Systems Manager - AWS Systems Manager", "product": "AWS Systems Manager", "tocs": "toc-contents.json", "feedback-item": "Systems Manager", "this_doc_guide": "User Guide", "forums": "https://repost.aws/tags/TA-UbbRGVYRWCDaCvae6itYg", "feedback": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forms/aws-doc-feedback?hidden_service_name=Systems%20Manager&topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/systems-manager/latest/userguide/getting-started-launch-managed-instance.html", "feedback-yes": "feedbackyes.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/systems-manager/latest/userguide/getting-started-launch-managed-instance.html", "rss": "aws-systems-manager-user-guide-updates.rss", "abstract": "AWS Systems Manager (formerly Amazon EC2 Systems Manager) is a unified interface that allows you to centralize operational data and automate tasks across your AWS resources.

To learn how to obtain this value, see Signing the token.\n\nIf your authorizer takes a user name and password, you can pass this information by using the `--mqtt-context` parameter. The following tabs show how to use the TestInvokeAuthorizer API to send a JSON object that contains a user name, password, and client name to your custom authorizer.\n\n### Unix-like\n```bash\naws iot test-invoke-authorizer --authorizer-name NAME_OF_AUTHORIZER  \\\n--mqtt-context '{\"username\": \"USER_NAME\", \"password\": \"dGVzdA==\", \"clientId\":\"CLIENT_NAME\"}'\n```\n\n### Windows CMD\n```cmd\naws iot test-invoke-authorizer --authorizer-name NAME_OF_AUTHORIZER  ^\n--mqtt-context '{\"username\": \"USER_NAME\", \"password\": \"dGVzdA==\", \"clientId\":\"CLIENT_NAME\"}'\n```\n\n### Windows PowerShell\n```powershell\naws iot test-invoke-authorizer --authorizer-name NAME_OF_AUTHORIZER  `\n--mqtt-context '{\"username\": \"USER_NAME\", \"password\": \"dGVzdA==\", \"clientId\":\"CLIENT_NAME\"}'\n```\n\nThe password must be base64-encoded.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful AWS expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Peripheral device support for WorkSpaces client applications\"?\n\nAssistant: The Amazon WorkSpaces client applications offer support for various peripheral devices, detailing their compatibility and usage across different client platforms.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Select your cookie preferences\nWe use essential cookies and similar tools that are necessary to provide our site and services. We use performance cookies to collect anonymous statistics, so we can understand how customers use our site and make improvements. Essential cookies cannot be deactivated, but you can choose “Customize” or “Decline” to decline performance cookies.\n\nIf you agree, AWS and approved third parties will also use cookies to provide useful site features, remember your preferences, and display relevant content, including relevant advertising. To accept or decline all non-essential cookies, choose “Accept” or “Decline.” To make more detailed choices, choose “Customize.”\n\nAcceptDeclineCustomize\n\n## Customize cookie preferences\nWe use cookies and similar tools (collectively, \"cookies\") for the following purposes.\n\n### Essential\nEssential cookies are necessary to provide our site and services and cannot be deactivated. They are usually set in response to your actions on the site, such as setting your privacy preferences, signing in, or filling in forms.\n\n### Performance\nPerformance cookies provide anonymous statistics about how customers navigate our site so we can improve site experience and performance. Approved third parties may perform analytics on our behalf, but they cannot use the data for their own purposes.\n\nAllow performance category\n\nAllowed\n\n### Functional\nFunctional cookies help us provide useful site features, remember your preferences, and display relevant content. Approved third parties may set these cookies to provide certain site features. If you do not allow these cookies, then some or all of these services may not function properly.\n\nAllow functional category\n\nAllowed\n\n### Advertising\nAdvertising cookies may be set through our site by us or our advertising partners and help us deliver relevant marketing content. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less relevant advertising.\n\nAllow advertising category\n\nAllowed\n\nBlocking some types of cookies may impact your experience of our sites. You may review and change your choices at any time by selecting Cookie preferences in the footer of this site. We and selected third-parties use cookies or similar technologies as specified in the AWS Cookie Notice.\n\n## Unable to save cookie preferences\nWe will only store essential cookies at this time, because we were unable to save your cookie preferences.\n\nIf you want to change your cookie preferences, try again later using the link in the AWS console footer, or contact support if the problem persists.\n\n## Monitors\nThe WorkSpaces client applications for Linux, macOS, and Windows support multiple monitors and the use of high DPI displays on both DCV and PCoIP WorkSpaces. For more information about display support on these WorkSpaces client applications, including how to set up multiple monitors, see Display Support for the Linux Client, Display Support for the macOS Client, or Display Support for the Windows Client.\n\nThe WorkSpaces Android client application supports a single monitor and the use of high DPI displays on PCoIP WorkSpaces. For more information about display support in the WorkSpaces Android client application, see Display Support for the Android Client.\n\nFor more information about support for high DPI displays, see Enabling high DPI display for WorkSpaces.\n\n## Keyboards and mice\nThe WorkSpaces client applications for Windows, macOS, and Linux support USB Bluetooth keyboards and mice.\n\nThe WorkSpaces client applications for Android and iPad support touch input, and both clients offer on-screen keyboards and support keyboards attached to the device. The Android client supports mice, and iPads with iPadOS 13.4 or later support Bluetooth mice. The iPad client also supports certain SwiftPoint mice models. For more information, see Swiftpoint GT, ProPoint, or PadPoint mouse.\n\n3D mice aren't supported by the WorkSpaces client applications.\n\nTo use languages or keyboards other than English, see Language and keyboard settings for WorkSpaces.\n\n## Audio headsets\nAnalog and USB audio headsets are supported on the Android, iPad, macOS, Linux, and Windows client applications, and on the PCoIP Zero Client. We recommend using a headset for audio calls. If you use your device's built-in microphone and speakers, you might experience echoing during your conversations. If you're having difficulty using a headset, see My headset doesn't work in my WorkSpace.\n\n## Printers\nThe Windows and macOS client applications support USB printers and local printing. The other client applications support other printing methods. For details about printer support for the various clients, see Printing from a WorkSpace.\n\nIf you're using a PCoIP zero client device to connect to your WorkSpace and you're having trouble using a USB printer or other USB peripheral devices, contact your WorkSpaces administrator for assistance.\n\n## Scanners, USB drives, and other storage devices\nThe WorkSpaces clients do not support scanners or locally attached peripheral storage devices, such as USB flash drives or external hard drives.\n\nIf you need to transfer, back up, or synchronize files between your WorkSpace and your local client device, consider using Amazon WorkDocs (if your WorkSpaces administrator has enabled it). You might also be able to email files to yourself.\n\n## Webcams and other video devices\nIf your WorkSpace is using the PCoIP protocol, the WorkSpaces clients do not support webcams or other video devices.\n\nIf your WorkSpace is using the DCV, versions 3.1.5 and later of the WorkSpaces client applications for Windows and macOS support webcams. For the Windows client, you must run the client on a machine that's running Windows 10 version 1607 or later.\n\n## Smart cards\nIf your WorkSpace is using the PCoIP protocol, the WorkSpaces clients do not support smart cards.\n\nIf your Windows or Linux WorkSpace is using the DCV protocol, version 3.1.1 or later of the WorkSpaces client application for Windows and version 3.1.5 or later of the WorkSpaces client application for macOS support smart cards.\n\n## Hardware security keys\nPCoIP Windows WorkSpaces support USB redirection for YubiKey U2F authentication with Windows WorkSpaces client apps.\n\n## WebAuthn authenticators\nIf your WorkSpace is using the PCoIP protocol, WebAuthn redirection isn't supported. However, you can use USB redirection for hardware authenticators. WebAuthn redirection is supported for WorkSpaces using DCV protocol.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/workspaces/latest/userguide/peripheral_devices.html", "title": "Peripheral device support for WorkSpaces client applications", "description": "The Amazon WorkSpaces client applications offer support for various peripheral devices, detailing their compatibility and usage across different client platforms.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 12, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 21:51:51", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"forums": "https://repost.aws/tags/TASLyB16lYTuydhKbyOm0bAw", "feedback": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forms/aws-doc-feedback?hidden_service_name=WorkSpaces&topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/workspaces/latest/userguide/peripheral_devices.html", "this_doc_guide": "User Guide", "guide-locale": "en_us", "tocs": "toc-contents.json", "assets_root": "/assets", "deployment_region": "IAD", "default_state": "peripheral_devices", "product": "Amazon WorkSpaces", "this_doc_product": "Amazon WorkSpaces", "feedback-no": "feedbackno.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/workspaces/latest/userguide/peripheral_devices.html", "target_state": "peripheral_devices", "title": "Peripheral device support for WorkSpaces client applications - Amazon WorkSpaces", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "feedback-item": "WorkSpaces", "abstract": "Connect to your WorkSpace, a virtual Microsoft Windows or Amazon Linux desktop in the AWS Cloud, from a supported device or web browser.", "keywords": "WorkSpaces,Amazon WorkSpaces,virtual Windows desktops,virtual Linux desktops,Desktop-as-a-Service,DaaS,Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI),USB stick,USB memory stick,keychain drive,USB key,thumb drive", "feedback-yes": "feedbackyes.html?topic_url=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/workspaces/latest/userguide/peripheral_devices.html", "favicon": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/assets/images/favicon.ico", "language": "en-US", "guide": "User Guide", "description": "Learn which peripheral devices are supported by the Amazon WorkSpaces client applications.", "pdf": "/pdfs/workspaces/latest/userguide/workspaces-ug.pdf#peripheral_devices", "scrapeId": "f7a5adc3-9dbc-4ac4-9e27-de21f34dd223", "sourceURL": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/workspaces/latest/userguide/peripheral_devices.html", "url": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/workspaces/latest/userguide/peripheral_devices.html", "statusCode": 200}}}
