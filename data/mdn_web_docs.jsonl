In this area of the site, we provide resources for web developers wanting to develop games. You will find many useful tutorials and technique articles in the main menu on the left, so feel free to explore.\n\nWe've also included a reference section so you can easily find information about all the most common APIs used in game development.\n\n**Note:**\nCreating games on the web draws on a number of core web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The [Learn web development](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development) section is a good place to go to get started with the basics.\n\n## Port native games to the Web\nIf you are a native developer (for example writing games in C++), and you are interested in how you can port your games over to the Web, you should learn more about our [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/index.html) tool — this is an LLVM to JavaScript compiler, which takes LLVM bytecode (e.g. generated from C/C++ using Clang, or from another language) and compiles that into [asm.js](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tools/asm.js), which can be run on the Web.\n\nTo get started, see:\n\n- [About Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/docs/introducing_emscripten/about_emscripten.html) for an introduction including high-level details.\n- [Download and Install](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html) for installing the toolchain.\n- [Emscripten Tutorial](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/Tutorial.html) for a tutorial to teach you how to get started.\n\n## Examples\nFor a list of web game examples, see our list of [Tutorials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials).\n\n## See also\n[Build New Games](http://buildnewgames.com/)\n\nA collaborative site featuring a large number of open web game development tutorials.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"SEO (Search Engine Optimization)\"?\n\nAssistant: SEO is the process of making a website more visible in search results, also termed improving search rankings.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Overview\nSEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the process of making a website more visible in search results, also termed improving search rankings.\n\nSearch engines crawl the web, following links from page to page, and index the content found. When you search, the search engine displays the indexed content. Crawlers follow rules. If you follow those rules closely when doing SEO for a website, you give the site the best chances of showing up among the first results, increasing traffic and possibly revenue (for e-commerce and ads).\n\nSearch engines give some guidelines for SEO, but big search engines keep result ranking as a trade secret. SEO combines official search engine guidelines, empirical knowledge, and theoretical knowledge from science papers or patents.\n\n## SEO Methods\nSEO methods fall into three broad classes:\n\n1. **Technical**: Tag the content using semantic HTML. When exploring the website, crawlers should only find the content you want indexed.\n2. **Copywriting**: Write content using your visitors' vocabulary. Use text as well as images so that crawlers can understand the subject.\n3. **Popularity**: You get most traffic when other established sites link to your site.\n\n## See also\n- [SEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEO) on Wikipedia\n- [Google Search Central](https://developers.google.com/search/docs)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SEO", "title": "SEO (Search Engine Optimization)", "description": "SEO is the process of making a website more visible in search results, also termed improving search rankings.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 3, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 23:21:12", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:image:height": "1080", "og:image:width": "1920", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "position": ["1", "2"], "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "description": "SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the process of making a website more visible in search results, also termed improving search rankings.", "language": "en-US", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "og:image:type": "image/png", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "ogTitle": "SEO - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "og:description": "SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the process of making a website more visible in search results, also termed improving search rankings.", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:locale": "en_US", "title": "SEO - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SEO", "ogLocale": "en_US", "og:title": "SEO - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN", "og:type": "website", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "ogDescription": "SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the process of making a website more visible in search results, also termed improving search rankings.", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SEO", "scrapeId": "09b801d1-4f0d-4fd5-88c6-651f0703ec65", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SEO", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SEO", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"State machine\"?\n\nAssistant: A state machine is a mathematical abstraction used to design algorithms. A state machine reads a set of inputs and changes to a different state based on those inputs.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Introduction\nA state machine is a mathematical abstraction used to design algorithms. A state machine reads a set of inputs and changes to a different state based on those inputs.\n\n## Definitions\nA state is a description of the status of a system waiting to execute a transition. A transition is a set of actions to execute when a condition is fulfilled or an event received. In a state diagram, circles represent each possible state and arrows represent transitions between states.\n\n## Types of State Machines\nThere are two types of basic state machines:\n\n1. **Deterministic Finite State Machine**: This kind allows only one possible transition for any allowed input. This is like the \"if\" statement in that `if x then doThis else doThat` is not possible. The computer must perform _one_ of the two options.\n\n2. **Non-Deterministic Finite State Machine**: Given some state, an input can lead to more than one different state.\n\n## Figures\n_Figure 1: Deterministic Finite State Machine._\n![The machine transitions from state 1 to state 2 for input X and from state 1 to state 3 for input Y](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/State_machine/statemachine1.png)\nIn _Figure 1_, the state begins in State 1; the state changes to State 2 given input 'X', or to State 3 given input 'Y'.\n\n_Figure 2: Non-Deterministic Finite State Machine._\n![The machine may remain in state 1, transitioning to itself, or may transition from state 1 to state 2 for input X](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/State_machine/statemachine2.png)\nIn _Figure 2_, given input 'X', the state can persist or change to State 2.\n\n## Conclusion\nNote that any regular expression can be represented by a state machine.\n\n## See also\n- [Finite-state machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) on Wikipedia\n- [UML state machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UML_state_machine) on Wikipedia\n- [Moore machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_machine) on Wikipedia\n- [Mealy machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mealy_machine) on Wikipedia\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/State_machine", "title": "State machine", "description": "A state machine is a mathematical abstraction used to design algorithms.

The provider of the API (called the caller) takes the function and calls back (or executes) the function at some point inside the caller's body. The caller is responsible for passing the right parameters into the callback function. The caller may also expect a particular return value from the callback function, which is used to instruct further behavior of the caller.\n\n## Synchronous vs Asynchronous Callbacks\nThere are two ways in which the callback may be called: synchronous and asynchronous. Synchronous callbacks are called immediately after the invocation of the outer function, with no intervening asynchronous tasks, while asynchronous callbacks are called at some point later, after an asynchronous operation has completed.\n\n## Example\nUnderstanding whether the callback is synchronously or asynchronously called is particularly important when analyzing side effects. Consider the following example:\n\n```javascript\nlet value = 1;\n\ndoSomething(() => {\n  value = 2;\n});\n\nconsole.log(value);\n```\n\nIf `doSomething` calls the callback synchronously, then the last statement would log `2` because `value = 2` is synchronously executed; otherwise, if the callback is asynchronous, the last statement would log `1` because `value = 2` is only executed after the `console.log` statement.\n\n## Examples of Callbacks\nExamples of synchronous callbacks include the callbacks passed to `Array.prototype.map()` and `Array.prototype.forEach()`. Examples of asynchronous callbacks include the callbacks passed to `setTimeout()` and `Promise.prototype.then()`.\n\n## Further Reading\nThe Using promises guide has more information on the timing of asynchronous callbacks.\n\n## See also\n- [Callback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callback_(computer_programming)) on Wikipedia\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Callback_function", "title": "Callback function", "description": "A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 7, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 23:21:47", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "og:description": "A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "ogDescription": "A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.", "og:title": "Callback function - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "og:image:type": "image/png", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Callback_function", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Callback_function", "og:image:width": "1920", "title": "Callback function - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN", "ogTitle": "Callback function - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN", "og:type": "website", "ogLocale": "en_US", "description": "A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "og:image:height": "1080", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "position": ["1", "2"], "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "language": "en-US", "og:locale": "en_US", "scrapeId": "69634865-45fb-4299-98fb-188b9fe18966", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Callback_function", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Callback_function", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)\"?\n\nAssistant: An application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML, designed for communication between web browsers and web servers.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## References\nThe HTTP reference documentation contains detailed information about headers, request methods, status responses, and lists relevant specifications and standards documents.\n\n[HTTP headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers)\n\nMessage headers are used to send metadata about a resource or a HTTP message, and to describe the behavior of the client or the server.\n\n[HTTP request methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods)\n\nRequest methods indicate the purpose of the request and what is expected if the request is successful. The most common methods are [`GET`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET) and [`POST`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST) for retrieving and sending data to servers, respectively, but there are other methods which serve different purposes.\n\n[HTTP response status codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)\n\nResponse status codes indicate the outcome of a specific HTTP request. Responses are grouped in five classes: informational, successful, redirections, client errors, and server errors.\n\n[HTTP resources and specifications](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Resources_and_specifications)\n\nThis page lists relevant resources about HTTP since it was first specified in the early 1990s.\n\n## HTTP guides\nHTTP is an extensible protocol that relies on concepts like resources and Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), a simple message structure, and client-server communication model. On top of these concepts, numerous extensions have been developed over the years that add functionality and updated semantics, including additional HTTP methods and headers.\n\nThe guides below are listed in order from general overviews to specialized, use-case-driven topics. Beginners are encouraged to start with the foundational guides before exploring more focused articles.\n\n[Overview of HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview)\n\nThe basic features of HTTP, what it can do, its intended use in web architecture, and its position in the protocol stack.\n\n[A typical HTTP session](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Session)\n\nDescribes the flow of an HTTP session, from establishing a connection, sending a request, to receiving a response.\n\n[HTTP messages](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Messages)\n\nHTTP messages transmitted as requests and responses have a defined structure. This article describes this general structure, its purpose, and the different types of messages.\n\n[URIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI)\n\nUniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) are used to describe and locate resources on the web and are an essential component in HTTP requests.\n\n[MIME types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/MIME_types)\n\nSince HTTP/1.0, different types of content can be transmitted. This article explains how this is accomplished using the [`Content-Type`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type) header and the MIME standard. A shortlist of common types used by web developers can be found in [Common MIME types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/MIME_types/Common_types).\n\n[Compression in HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Compression)\n\nBrowsers and servers compress their messages before sending them over the network to reduce the amount of data that needs to be transmitted, improving transfer speed and bandwidth utilization.\n\n[HTTP caching](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Caching)\n\nCaching is a highly important mechanism for delivering fast experiences on the Web and for efficient use of resources. This article describes different methods of caching and how to use HTTP headers to control them.\n\n[HTTP authentication](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication)\n\nAuthentication is a way to verify the identity of a client when making requests to a server. It ensures that only authorized users or systems can access certain resources.\n\n[Using HTTP cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies)\n\nAlthough HTTP is a stateless protocol, a server can send a [`Set-Cookie`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie) header with the response. The client then returns the cookie's value with every subsequent request to the server in the form of a [`Cookie`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cookie) request header. This adds the ability to store and exchange a small amount of data which effectively adds state to some client-server interactions.\n\n[Redirections in HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Redirections)\n\nURL redirection, also known as URL forwarding, is a technique to give more than one URL address to a page, a form, a whole website, or a web application. HTTP has a special kind of response, called a HTTP redirect, for this operation.\n\n[HTTP conditional requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Conditional_requests)\n\nIn conditional requests, the outcome of a request depends on the value of a validator in the request. This method is used heavily in [caching](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Caching) and use cases such as resuming a download, preventing lost updates when modifying a document on the server, and more.\n\n[HTTP range requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Range_requests)\n\nA range request asks the server to send a specific part (or parts) of a resource back to a client instead of the full resource. Range requests are useful for cases when a client knows they need only part of a large file, or for cases where an application allows the user to pause and resume a download.\n\n[Content negotiation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Content_negotiation)\n\nHTTP defines a set of message headers, starting with [`Accept`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept) as a way for a browser to announce the format, language, or encoding it prefers. This article explains how this advertisement happens, how the server is expected to react, and how it chooses the most adequate response to a request.\n\n[Connection management in HTTP/1.x](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Connection_management_in_HTTP_1.x)\n\nHTTP/1.1 was the first version of HTTP to support persistent connections and pipelining. This article explains both concepts, including the pros and cons of each.\n\n[Evolution of HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Evolution_of_HTTP)\n\nHTTP was created in the early 1990s and has been extended several times. This article goes through its history and describes HTTP/0.9, HTTP/1.0, HTTP/1.1, through HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, as well as novelties introduced over the years.\n\n[Protocol upgrade mechanism](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Protocol_upgrade_mechanism)\n\nHTTP/1.1 provides a mechanism to upgrade an already-established connection to a different protocol using the [`Upgrade`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Upgrade) header. A client can upgrade a connection from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2, or an HTTP(S) connection to a [WebSocket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket) ( `ws` / `wss`).\n\n[Proxy servers and tunneling](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Proxy_servers_and_tunneling)\n\nA proxy can be on the user's local computer, or anywhere between the user's computer and a destination server on the Internet. This page outlines some basics about proxies and introduces a few configuration options.\n\n[HTTP Client hints](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Client_hints)\n\nClient Hints are a set of response headers that a server can use to proactively request information from a client about the device, network, user, and user-agent-specific preferences. The server can then determine which resources to send, based on the information that the client chooses to provide.\n\n[Network Error Logging](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Network_Error_Logging)Experimental\n\nNetwork Error Logging is a mechanism that can be configured via the `NEL` HTTP response header. This experimental header allows websites and applications to opt-in to receive reports about failed (or even successful) network fetches from supporting browsers.\n\n[Browser detection using the user agent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Browser_detection_using_the_user_agent)\n\nIt's very rarely a good idea to use user agent sniffing to detect a browser, but there are edge cases that require it. This document will guide you in doing this as correctly as possible when this is necessary, with an emphasis on considerations to make before embarking on this route.\n\n[Configuring servers for Ogg media](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Formats/Configuring_servers_for_Ogg_media)\n\nThis guide covers a few server configuration changes that may be necessary for your web server to correctly serve Ogg media files. This information may also be useful if you encounter other media types your server isn't already configured to recognize.\n\n## Security and privacy\n[Mozilla web security guidelines](https://infosec.mozilla.org/guidelines/web_security)\n\nA collection of tips to help operational teams with creating secure web applications.\n\n[Permissions Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Permissions_Policy)\n\nPermissions Policy provides mechanisms for web developers to explicitly declare what functionality can and cannot be used on a website. You define a set of \"policies\" that restrict what APIs the site's code can access or modify the browser's default behavior for certain features.\n\n[Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)\n\nCross-site HTTP requests are requests for resources from a different domain than that of the resource making the request. Web pages today very commonly load cross-site resources, for example, a page 'Domain A' ( `http://domaina.example/`) requests an image on 'Domain B' ( `http://domainb.foo/image.jpg`) via the `img` element. CORS allows web developers to control how their site reacts to cross-site requests.\n\n[Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP)\n\nCSP allows website administrators to use the [`Content-Security-Policy`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy) response header to control which resources the client is allowed to load for a given page. The CSP guide describes the overall Content Security Policy mechanism which helps detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks.\n\n[Cross-Origin Resource Policy (CORP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cross-Origin_Resource_Policy)\n\nCORP lets websites and applications opt in to protection against specific requests from other origins (such as those issued with elements like `<script>` and `<img>`), to mitigate speculative side-channel attacks.\n\n## Tools & resources\nHelpful tools and resources for understanding and debugging HTTP.\n\n[Firefox Developer Tools](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/index.html)\n\n[Network monitor](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/network_monitor/index.html)\n\n[HTTP Observatory](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/observatory)\n\nA project designed to help developers, system administrators, and security professionals configure their sites safely and securely.\n\n[RedBot](https://redbot.org/)\n\nTools to check your cache-related headers.\n\n[nghttp2](https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2)\n\nAn HTTP/2 client, server and proxy implementation written in C with load test and benchmarking tools and an HPACK encoder and decoder.\n\n[curl](https://github.com/curl/curl)\n\nA command-line tool for transferring data specified with URL syntax.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Web Performance\"?\n\nAssistant: Web performance is the objective measurements and the perceived user experience of load time and runtime.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Web performance guides\nPerformance means efficiency. In the context of Open Web Apps, this document explains in general what performance is, how the browser platform helps improve it, and what tools and processes you can use to test and improve it.\n\n## Populating the page: how browsers work\nUsers want web experiences with content that is fast to load and smooth to interact with. Therefore, a developer should strive to achieve these two goals. To understand how to improve performance and perceived performance, it helps to understand how the browser works.\n\n## Understanding latency\nLatency is the time it takes for a packet of data to travel from source to a destination. In terms of performance optimization, it's important to optimize to reduce causes of latency and to test site performance emulating high latency to optimize for users with slow or unreliable connections.\n\n## Recommended Web Performance Timings: How long is too long?\nThere are no clear set rules as to what constitutes a slow pace when loading pages, but there are specific guidelines for indicating content will load (1 second), idling (50ms), animating (16.7ms) and responding to user input (50 to 200ms).\n\n## Using dns-prefetch\nDNS-prefetch is an attempt to resolve domain names before resources get requested. This could be a file loaded later or link target a user tries to follow.\n\n## Navigation and resource timings\nNavigation timings are metrics measuring a browser's document navigation events. Resource timings are detailed network timing measurements regarding the loading of an application's resources. Both provide the same read-only properties, but navigation timing measures the main document's timings whereas the resource timing provides the times for all the assets or resources called in by that main document and the resources' requested resources.\n\n## Optimizing startup performance\nImproving your startup performance is often one of the highest value performance optimizations that can be made. Good user experience includes ensuring your app loads quickly. This article provides performance tips and suggestions for both writing new applications and porting applications to the web from other platforms.\n\n## Critical rendering path\nThe Critical Rendering Path is the sequence of steps the browser goes through to convert the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into pixels on the screen. Optimizing the critical render path improves render performance. The critical rendering path includes the Document Object Model (DOM), CSS Object Model (CSSOM), render tree and layout.\n\n## Lazy loading\nLazy loading is a strategy to identify resources as non-blocking (non-critical) and load these only when needed. It's a way to shorten the length of the critical rendering path, which translates into reduced page load times.\n\n## Speculative loading\nSpeculative loading refers to the practice of performing navigation actions (such as DNS fetching, fetching resources, or rendering documents) before the associated pages are actually visited, based on predictions as to what pages the user is most likely to visit next.\n\n## Performance budgets\nA performance budget is a limit to prevent regressions. It can apply to a file, a file type, all files loaded on a page, a specific metric (e.g. Time to Interactive), a custom metric (e.g. Time to Hero Element), or a threshold over a period of time.\n\n## Performance Monitoring: RUM vs. synthetic monitoring\nSynthetic monitoring and real user monitoring (RUM) are two approaches for monitoring and providing insight into web performance. RUM and synthetic monitoring provide for different views of performance and have benefits, good use cases and shortfalls. RUM is generally best suited for understanding long-term trends whereas synthetic monitoring is very well suited to regression testing and mitigating shorter-term performance issues during development. In this article we define and compare these two performance monitoring approaches.\n\n## CSS and JavaScript animation performance\nAnimations are critical for a pleasurable user experience on many applications. There are many ways to implement web animations, such as CSS transitions or animations or JavaScript-based animations (using requestAnimationFrame()). In this article, we analyze the performance differences between CSS-based and JavaScript-based animation.\n\n## Animation performance and frame rate\nAnimation on the web can be done via SVG, JavaScript, including <canvas> and WebGL, CSS animation, <video>, animated GIFs and even animated PNGs and other image types. The performance cost of animating a CSS property can vary from one property to another, and animating expensive CSS properties can result in Jank as the browser struggles to hit a smooth frame rate.\n\n## Tutorials for beginners\nThe MDN Web Performance Learning Area contains modern, up-to-date tutorials covering Performance essentials. Start here if you are a newcomer to performance.\n\n## Web performance: brief overview\nOverview of the web performance learning path. Start your journey here.\n\n## What is web performance?\nThis article starts the module off with a good look at what performance actually is — this includes the tools, metrics, APIs, networks, and groups of people we need to consider when thinking about performance, and how we can make performance part of our web development workflow.\n\n## How do users perceive performance?\nMore important than how fast your website is in milliseconds, is how fast your users perceive your site to be. These perceptions are impacted by actual page load time, idling, responsiveness to user interaction, and the smoothness of scrolling and other animations. In this article, we discuss the various loading metrics, animation, and responsiveness metrics, along with best practices to improve user perception, if not the actual timings.\n\n## Web performance basics\nIn addition to the front end components of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and media files, there are features that can make applications slower and features that can make applications subjectively and objectively faster. There are many APIs, developer tools, best practices, and bad practices relating to web performance. Here we'll introduce many of these features ad the basic level and provide links to deeper dives to improve performance for each topic.\n\n## HTML performance features\nSome attributes and the source order of your markup can impact the performance of your website. By minimizing the number of DOM nodes, making sure the best order and attributes are used for including content such as styles, scripts, media, and third-party scripts, you can drastically improve the user experience. This article looks in detail at how HTML can be used to ensure maximum performance.\n\n## Multimedia: images and video\nThe lowest hanging fruit of web performance is often media optimization. Serving different media files based on each user agent's capability, size, and pixel density is possible. Additional tips like removing audio tracks from background videos can improve performance even further. In this article we discuss the impact video, audio, and image content has on performance, and the methods to ensure that impact is as minimal as possible.\n\n## CSS performance features\nCSS may be a less important optimization focus for improved performance, but there are some CSS features that impact performance more than others. In this article we look at some CSS properties that impact performance and suggested ways of handling styles to ensure performance is not negatively impacted.\n\n## JavaScript performance best practices\nJavaScript, when used properly, can allow for interactive and immersive web experiences — or it can significantly harm download time, render time, in-app performance, battery life, and user experience. This article outlines some JavaScript best practices that should be considered to ensure even complex content is as performant as possible.\n\n## Performance APIs\nThe Performance API is a group of standards used to measure the performance of web applications. The following pages provide overviews of the Performance APIs including information on how to use them.\n\n## High precision timing\nThe Performance API allows high precision measurements that are based on time in potential sub-millisecond resolution and a stable monotonic clock that is not subject to system clock skew or adjustments. The high resolution timers are needed for accurate benchmarking instead of the less precise and non-monotonic Date timestamps.\n\n## Long animation frame timing\nLong animation frames (LoAFs) can impact the user experience of a website. They can cause slow user interface (UI) updates, resulting in seemingly unresponsive controls and janky (or non-smooth) animated effects and scrolling, leading to user frustration. The Long Animation Frames API allows developers to get information about the long animation frames and better understand their root causes. This article shows how to use the Long Animation Frames API.\n\n## Monitoring bfcache blocking reasons\nThe PerformanceNavigationTiming.notRestoredReasons property reports information on why the current document was blocked from using the bfcache on navigation. Developers can use this information to identify pages that need updates to make them bfcache-compatible, thereby improving site performance.\n\n## Navigation timing\nNavigation Timing provides metrics associated with navigating from one page to another via the PerformanceNavigationTiming API. For example, you can determine how much time it takes to load or unload a document, or log the time it took until DOM construction has finished and interaction with the DOM is possible.\n\n## Performance data\nThe Performance API doesn't provide performance data analysis, or visualizations. However, the Performance API is integrated well with developer tools and its data is often sent to analytics end points and libraries to record performance metrics which help you to evaluate the data to find performance bottlenecks affecting your users. This page provides an overview about what sorts of Performance API data exists, how it is collected, and how it can be accessed.\n\n## Resource Timing API\nResource Timing enables retrieving and analyzing detailed network timing data for the loading of an application's resources. An application can use the timing metrics to determine, for example, the length of time it takes to load a specific resource (such as an image or a script) either implicitly as part of page load or explicitly from JavaScript, for example using the fetch() API.\n\n## Server timing\nServer-Timing allows servers to communicate metrics about the request-response cycle to the user agent. You can collect this information and act on server-side metrics in the same way as all the other metrics processed with the Performance API.\n\n## User Timing API\nCreate application specific timestamps using the user timing API's \"mark\" and \"measure\" entry types using high-precision timestamps that are part of the browser's performance timeline.\n\n## Related APIs\nThe following APIs are also useful for measuring and influencing page performance.\n\n## Page Visibility API\nProvides events you can watch for to know when a document becomes visible or hidden, as well as features to look at the current visibility state of the page.\n\n## Background Tasks API\nThe Cooperative Scheduling of Background Tasks API (also referred to as the Background Tasks API or the requestIdleCallback() API) provides the ability to queue tasks to be executed automatically by the user agent when it determines that there is free time to do so.\n\n## Beacon API\nThe Beacon interface schedules an asynchronous and non-blocking request to a web server.\n\n## Intersection Observer API\nThe Intersection Observer API provides a way to asynchronously observe changes in the intersection of a target element with an ancestor element or with a top-level document's Viewport. This enabled use cases such as Timing element visibility to get asynchronously notified when elements of interest become visible.\n\n## Media Capabilities API\nExposes decoding and encoding abilities of a client device, such as whether media is supported and whether playback should be smooth and power efficient, with real time feedback about playback to better enable adaptive streaming, and access to display property information.\n\n## Network Information API\nInformation about the system's connection in terms of general connection type (e.g., 'wifi, 'cellular', etc.). This can be used to select high definition content or low definition content based on the user's connection.\n\n## Battery Status API\nThe Battery API, provides information about the system's battery charge level and lets you be notified by events that are sent when the battery level or charging status change. This can be used to adjust your app's resource usage to reduce battery drain when the battery is low, or to save changes before the battery runs out in order to prevent data loss.\n\n## Navigator.deviceMemory\nThe deviceMemory read-only property of the Navigator interface returns the approximate amount of device memory in gigabytes.\n\n## FetchEvent.preloadResponse\nThe preloadResponse read-only property of the FetchEvent interface returns a Promise that resolves to the navigation preload Response if navigation preload was triggered, or undefined otherwise.\n\n## Profiling and tooling\nFirefox Profiler Performance Features provides information on how to use and understand the performance features in your developer tools, including Call Tree, Flame Graph, Stack Chart, Marker Chart and Network Chart.\n\n## Profiling with the built-in profiler\nLearn how to profile app performance with Firefox's built-in profiler.\n\n## References\nHTML, CSS, JavaScript, HTTP.\n\n## See also\nResponsive images HTML guide, Web Workers API, Offline and background operation, Caching, Client hints.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance", "title": "Web Performance", "description": "Web performance is the objective measurements and the perceived user experience of load time and runtime.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 46, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 23:24:36", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "title": "Web performance | MDN", "og:description": "Web performance is the objective measurements and the perceived user experience of load time and runtime.\nWeb performance is how long a site takes to load, become interactive and responsive, and how smooth the content is during user interactions.\nPerformance concerns questions like: Is scrolling smooth?

In vector images, they are used to model smooth curves that can be scaled indefinitely.\n\n## Definition\nThe curve is defined by a set of control points with a minimum of two. Web related graphics and animations often use cubic Béziers, which are curves with four control points P0, P1, P2, and P3.\n\n## Drawing a Bézier Curve\nTo draw a quadratic Bézier curve, two imaginary lines are drawn, one from P0 to P1 and the other from P1 to P2. A third imaginary line is drawn with its starting point moving steadily on the first helper line and the end point on the second helper line. On this imaginary line a point is drawn from its starting point moving steadily to its end point. The curve this point describes is the Bézier curve.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Web Standards\"?\n\nAssistant: Web standards are rules established by international standards bodies that define how the Web works and which sometimes control the Internet as well.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Overview\nWeb standards are rules established by international standards bodies that define how the Web works (and which sometimes control the Internet as well). Several standards bodies are responsible for defining different aspects of the Web, and all the standards must coordinate to keep the Web maximally usable and accessible. Web standards also must evolve to improve the current status and adapt to new circumstances.\n\n## Standards Bodies\nThis non-exhaustive list gives you an idea of which standards websites and network systems must conform to:\n\n- **IETF** (Internet Engineering Task Force): Internet standards (STD), which among other things govern set-up and use of URIs, HTTP, and MIME.\n- **W3C**: specifications for markup language (e.g., HTML), style definitions (i.e., CSS), DOM, accessibility.\n- **IANA** (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority): name and number registries.\n- **Ecma Intl.:** scripting standards, most prominently for JavaScript.\n- **ISO** (International Organization for Standardization): standards governing a diverse array of aspects, including character encodings, website management, and user-interface design.\n\n## Opposing Standards\nOccasionally, the members of a standards body may disagree with how a feature is developing, and some may oppose it. This means that technology implementers (for example web browser vendors) who disagree with the feature in its current form are unlikely to ever implement it. Vendors that do agree with the feature usually still implement it so that it is available to experiment with and provide feedback on. This enables interested parties to build use cases and demonstrate the issues with the feature, hopefully working toward reaching a consensus on a future version. Standards body members often publish a record of their position on different standards, for reference. For example, see Mozilla Specification Positions and WebKit Standards Positions.\n\n## See Also\n- Web standards on Wikipedia\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Web_standards", "title": "Web Standards", "description": "Web standards are rules established by international standards bodies that define how the Web works and which sometimes control the Internet as well.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": false, "section_count": 4, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 23:31:35", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"language": "en-US", "ogDescription": "Web standards are rules established by international standards bodies that define how the Web works (and which sometimes control the Internet as well).", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Web_standards", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Web_standards", "og:image:type": "image/png", "title": "Web standards - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN", "og:title": "Web standards - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "og:description": "Web standards are rules established by international standards bodies that define how the Web works (and which sometimes control the Internet as well).", "og:image:height": "1080", "og:locale": "en_US", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "ogLocale": "en_US", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "og:type": "website", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "position": ["1", "2"], "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "ogTitle": "Web standards - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "description": "Web standards are rules established by international standards bodies that define how the Web works (and which sometimes control the Internet as well).", "og:image:width": "1920", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "scrapeId": "cf1f7031-07e5-48cc-8efb-622bdd9e3d86", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Web_standards", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Web_standards", "statusCode": 200}}}

Besides a browser, a user agent could be a bot scraping webpages, a download manager, or another app accessing the Web. Along with each request they make to the server, browsers include a self-identifying User-Agent HTTP header called a user agent (UA) string. This string often identifies the browser, its version number, and its host operating system.\n\n## User Agent Spoofing\nSpam bots, download managers, and some browsers often send a fake UA string to announce themselves as a different client. This is known as user agent spoofing.\n\n## Accessing User Agent String\nThe user agent string can be accessed with JavaScript on the client side using the navigator.userAgent property.\n\n## Example User Agent String\nA typical user agent string looks like this: \"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:124.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/124.0\".\n\n## See also\n- User agent on Wikipedia\n- navigator.userAgent\n- Browser detection using the user agent\n- RFC 2616, section 14.43: The User-Agent header\n- Related glossary terms: Browser\n- HTTP Headers: User-agent\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent", "title": "User agent", "description": "A user agent is a computer program representing a person, for example, a browser in a Web context.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 5, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 23:31:54", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"language": "en-US", "ogTitle": "User agent - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN", "og:type": "website", "ogDescription": "A user agent is a computer program representing a person, for example, a browser in a Web context.", "og:image:width": "1920", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "title": "User agent - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN", "og:locale": "en_US", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "description": "A user agent is a computer program representing a person, for example, a browser in a Web context.", "og:image:height": "1080", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "position": ["1", "2"], "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent", "og:title": "User agent - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent", "og:description": "A user agent is a computer program representing a person, for example, a browser in a Web context.", "ogLocale": "en_US", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "og:image:type": "image/png", "scrapeId": "8a2163ac-d9c9-42f6-bafb-500a6de5cdf4", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent", "statusCode": 200}}}

We will continue to develop & maintain our web documentation that will remain free and accessible for everyone. There will be no change there. Even more, we believe that MDN Web Docs will benefit from MDN Plus, as we plan to reinvest part of the gains from MDN Plus and improve our documentation as well as the overall user experience on the website.\n\n## Are we violating any OS license obligation by adding a paid product to MDN?\nMDN content is made available under a CC BY-SA 2.5 license. That license doesn't preclude Mozilla (or other users of MDN content) from having a paid product. MDN Plus adds premium features like updates and collections on top of the free content. Regular users can still access and reuse MDN content under the Creative Commons license.\n\n## Where will the money from MDN Plus go?\nSince its beginning in 2005, MDN Web Docs has been a project hosted and provided by Mozilla. Mozilla covers the cost of infrastructure, development and maintenance of the MDN platform, including a team of engineers and its own team of dedicated writers.\n\nMozilla wants MDN Plus to help ensure that MDN's open source content continues to be supported into the future. MDN Plus has been built only with Mozilla resources, and any revenue generated by MDN Plus will stay within Mozilla. We are looking into ways to reinvest some of these additional funds into open source projects contributing to MDN but it is still in the early stages.\n\n## Does the launch of MDN Plus impact the relationship with partners like OWD?\nThe existence of a new subscription model will not detract from MDN's current free Web Docs offering in any way. The current experience of accessing web documentation will not change for users who do not wish to sign up for a premium subscription. Open Web Docs (OWD) and Mozilla will continue to work closely together on MDN for the best possible web platform documentation for everyone. For more information about how our organizations work together, please check this article.\n\n## What regions is MDN Plus available in?\nThe free version of MDN Plus is available worldwide. Anyone can create an MDN Plus account and try out a limited version of the premium features. As for the paid plans, they are currently available as follows: in the United States, Canada (since March 24th, 2022), Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Sweden, Singapore, Switzerland, Spain (since April 28th, 2022), Estonia, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal, Slovakia and Slovenia (since June 15th, 2022). We are working on expanding this list even further.\n\n## I have an idea for MDN Plus, who should I contact?\nIn case you have an idea you would like to share about MDN Plus, you can add your suggestions to our mdn-community repo.\n\nIf a subscriber, you can also leave us feedback by accessing the ‘Feedback’ option in the user menu.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/plus/docs/faq", "title": "Frequently asked questions", "description": "This page provides answers to frequently asked questions about MDN Plus, a premium subscription service by Mozilla.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": false, "section_count": 10, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 23:35:30", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"title": "FAQ | MDN Plus", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "og:description": "The MDN Web Docs site provides information about Open Web technologies including HTML, CSS, and APIs for both Web sites and progressive web apps.", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "og:image:type": "image/png", "ogLocale": "en_US", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "The MDN Web Docs site provides information about Open Web technologies including HTML, CSS, and APIs for both Web sites and progressive web apps.", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/plus/docs/faq", "ogTitle": "FAQ | MDN Plus", "og:type": "website", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/plus/docs/faq", "og:title": "FAQ | MDN Plus", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "ogDescription": "The MDN Web Docs site provides information about Open Web technologies including HTML, CSS, and APIs for both Web sites and progressive web apps.", "og:locale": "en_US", "og:image:height": "1080", "language": "en-US", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "og:image:width": "1920", "scrapeId": "b7d2cb5a-7b84-4433-b7f1-308f395e9d62", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/plus/docs/faq", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/plus/docs/faq", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Forbidden request header\"?\n\nAssistant: A forbidden request header is an HTTP header name-value pair that cannot be set or modified programmatically in a request.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Definition\nA forbidden request header is an HTTP header name-value pair that cannot be set or modified programmatically in a request. For headers forbidden to be modified in responses, see forbidden response header name. Modifying such headers is forbidden because the user agent retains full control over them.\n\n## Example\nFor example, the `Date` header is a forbidden request header, so this code cannot set the message `Date` field:\n\n```javascript\nfetch(\"https://httpbin.org/get\", {\n  headers: {\n    Date: new Date().toUTCString(),\n  },\n});\n```\n\n## Reserved Headers\nNames starting with `Sec-` are reserved for creating new headers safe from APIs that grant developers control over headers, such as `fetch()`.\n\n## List of Forbidden Headers\nForbidden headers are one of the following:\n\n- `Accept-Charset`\n- `Accept-Encoding`\n- `Access-Control-Request-Headers`\n- `Access-Control-Request-Method`\n- `Connection`\n- `Content-Length`\n- `Cookie`\n- `Date`\n- `DNT`\n- `Expect`\n- `Host`\n- `Keep-Alive`\n- `Origin`\n- `Permissions-Policy`\n- `Proxy-` headers\n- `Sec-` headers\n- `Referer`\n- `TE`\n- `Trailer`\n- `Transfer-Encoding`\n- `Upgrade`\n- `Via`\n- `X-HTTP-Method`, but only when it contains a forbidden method name ( `CONNECT`, `TRACE`, `TRACK`)\n- `X-HTTP-Method-Override`, but only when it contains a forbidden method name\n- `X-Method-Override`, but only when it contains a forbidden method name\n\n## Notes\n**Note:** The `User-Agent` header used to be forbidden, but no longer is. However, Chrome still silently drops the header from Fetch requests (see Chromium bug 571722).\n\n**Note:** While the `Referer` header is listed as a forbidden header in the spec, the user agent does not retain full control over it and the header can be programmatically modified. For example, when using `fetch()`, the `Referer` header can be programmatically modified via the `referrer` option.\n\n## See also\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - Forbidden response header name\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Forbidden_header_name", "title": "Forbidden request header", "description": "A forbidden request header is an HTTP header name-value pair that cannot be set or modified programmatically in a request.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 6, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 23:38:28", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Forbidden_request_header", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "language": "en-US", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Forbidden_request_header", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "ogTitle": "Forbidden request header - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "ogLocale": "en_US", "position": ["1", "2"], "title": "Forbidden request header - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN", "og:image:width": "1920", "description": "A forbidden request header is an HTTP header name-value pair that cannot be set of modified programmatically in a request.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Accessibility\"?\n\nAssistant: Accessibility (often abbreviated to A11y) in web development means enabling as many people as possible to use websites, even when those people's abilities are limited in some way.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Key tutorials\nThe MDN Accessibility Learning Area contains modern, up-to-date tutorials covering the following accessibility essentials:\n\n1. [What is accessibility?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/What_is_accessibility)\n   This article starts off the module with a good look at what accessibility actually is — this includes what groups of people we need to consider and why, what tools different people use to interact with the Web, and how we can make accessibility part of our web development workflow.\n\n2. [HTML: A good basis for accessibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/HTML)\n   A great deal of web content can be made accessible just by making sure that the correct HTML elements are used for the correct purpose at all times. This article looks in detail at how HTML can be used to ensure maximum accessibility.\n\n3. [CSS and JavaScript accessibility best practices](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/CSS_and_JavaScript)\n   CSS and JavaScript, when used properly, also have the potential to allow for accessible web experiences. They can significantly harm accessibility if misused. This article outlines some CSS and JavaScript best practices that should be considered to ensure that even complex content is as accessible as possible.\n\n4. [WAI-ARIA basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/WAI-ARIA_basics)\n   Following on from the previous article, sometimes making complex UI controls that involve unsemantic HTML and dynamic JavaScript-updated content can be difficult. WAI-ARIA is a technology that can help with such problems by adding in further semantics that browsers and assistive technologies can recognize and let users know what is going on. Here we'll show how to use it at a basic level to improve accessibility.\n\n5. [Accessible multimedia](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/Multimedia)\n   Another category of content that can create accessibility problems is multimedia — video, audio, and image content need to be given proper textual alternatives so that they can be understood by assistive technologies and their users. This article shows how.\n\n6. [Mobile accessibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/Mobile)\n   With web access on mobile devices being so popular and popular platforms such as iOS and Android having fully-fledged accessibility tools, it is important to consider the accessibility of your web content on these platforms. This article looks at mobile-specific accessibility considerations.\n\n## Other documentation\n1. [Understanding the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Understanding_WCAG)\n   This set of articles provides quick explanations to help you understand the steps that need to be taken to conform to the recommendations outlined in the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG 2.0 or just WCAG, for the purposes of this writing).\n\n2. [Introduction to color and accessibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Understanding_Colors_and_Luminance)\n   This article discusses our perception of light and color, provides a foundation for the use of color in accessible designs, and demonstrates best practices for visual and readable content.\n\n3. [Keyboard-navigable JavaScript widgets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Keyboard-navigable_JavaScript_widgets)\n   Until now, web developers who wanted to make their styled <div> and <span> based widgets accessible have lacked proper techniques. Keyboard accessibility is part of the minimum accessibility requirements, which a developer should be aware of.\n\n4. [ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA)\n   This is a collection of articles to learn how to use Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) to make your HTML documents more accessible.\n\n5. [Mobile accessibility checklist](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Mobile_accessibility_checklist)\n   This article provides a concise checklist of accessibility requirements for mobile app developers.\n\n6. [Cognitive accessibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Cognitive_accessibility)\n   This article explains how to ensure that the web content you're creating is accessible to people with cognitive impairments.\n\n7. [Accessibility for seizure disorders](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Seizure_disorders)\n   Some types of visual web content can induce seizures in people with certain brain disorders. This article helps you understand the types of content that can be problematic and find tools and strategies to help you avoid them.\n\n## See also\n- [WAI Interest Group](https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/groups/waiig/)\n- [Developer guides](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Guides)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility", "title": "Accessibility", "description": "Accessibility (often abbreviated to A11y) in web development means enabling as many people as possible to use websites, even when those people's abilities are limited in some way.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 3, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 23:42:56", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"language": "en-US", "ogTitle": "Accessibility | MDN", "ogDescription": "Accessibility (often abbreviated to A11y — as in, \"a\", then 11 characters, and then \"y\") in web development means enabling as many people as possible to use websites, even when those people's abilities are limited in some way.", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "ogLocale": "en_US", "og:image:height": "1080", "title": "Accessibility | MDN", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:title": "Accessibility | MDN", "og:description": "Accessibility (often abbreviated to A11y — as in, \"a\", then 11 characters, and then \"y\") in web development means enabling as many people as possible to use websites, even when those people's abilities are limited in some way.", "og:image:type": "image/png", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "og:locale": "en_US", "og:image:width": "1920", "description": "Accessibility (often abbreviated to A11y — as in, \"a\", then 11 characters, and then \"y\") in web development means enabling as many people as possible to use websites, even when those people's abilities are limited in some way.", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "og:type": "website", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "position": ["1", "2"], "scrapeId": "b4de0a07-2306-4ea0-b1c4-995be770e5f8", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Delta\"?\n\nAssistant: The term delta refers to the difference between two values or states.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Definition\nThe term **delta** refers to the difference between two values or states.\n\nThe name originates from the Greek letter Δ (delta), which is equivalent to the letter _D_ in the Roman alphabet. _Delta_ refers to the use of the letter Δ as a shorthand for _difference_.\n\n## Usage\nThe term _delta_ is commonly used when communicating changes in speed, position, or acceleration of a physical or virtual object. It's also used when describing changes in the volume or frequency of sound waves.\n\n## Examples\nFor example, when describing how far an object on the screen moves left-to-right, one might use the term _delta x_ or _Δx_.\n\nLikewise, given the new value of _X_ and its old value, you might compute the delta like this:\n\n```javascript\nlet deltaX = newX - oldX;\n```\n\nMore commonly, you receive the delta and use it to update a saved previous condition:\n\n```javascript\nlet newX = oldX + deltaX;\n```\n\nFor example, mouse wheel events [`WheelEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WheelEvent) offer the amount the wheel moved since the last event in its [`deltaX`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WheelEvent/deltaX \"deltaX\"), [`deltaY`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WheelEvent/deltaY \"deltaY\"), and [`deltaZ`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WheelEvent/deltaZ \"deltaZ\") properties.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Delta", "title": "Delta", "description": "The term delta refers to the difference between two values or states.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 3, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 23:43:07", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"description": "The term delta refers to the difference between two values or states.", "ogLocale": "en_US", "og:image:type": "image/png", "og:title": "Delta - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Delta", "language": "en-US", "title": "Delta - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN", "ogDescription": "The term delta refers to the difference between two values or states.", "og:type": "website", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Delta", "position": ["1", "2"], "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "ogTitle": "Delta - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "og:image:width": "1920", "og:locale": "en_US", "og:image:height": "1080", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "og:description": "The term delta refers to the difference between two values or states.", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "scrapeId": "7341b5b0-2a76-4e0a-902a-22fad18c3bf5", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Delta", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Delta", "statusCode": 200}}}

It describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Beginner's tutorials\nYour first website: Styling the content: This article provides a brief tour of what CSS is and how to use it, aimed at people who are completely new to web development.\n\nCSS styling basics: Our Learn web development section's CSS basics module teaches CSS fundamentals from the ground up.\n\nCSS text styling: Here we look at fundamentals including setting font, boldness, italics, line and letter spacing, drop shadows, and other text features. We round off the module by looking at applying custom fonts to your page, and styling lists and links.\n\nCSS layout: Now it's time to look at how to correctly lay out your boxes in relation to one another, and the browser viewport. This module looks at floats, positioning, other modern layout tools, and building responsive designs that will adapt to different devices, screen sizes, and resolutions.\n\n## Reference\nThe CSS reference is an exhaustive reference for seasoned Web developers, describing every property and concept of CSS, including:\n\n- The syntax and forms of the language\n- Specificity, inheritance, and the cascade\n- CSS selectors, including pseudo-elements, nesting, scoping and shadow parts\n- CSS at-rules, including media and container queries\n- CSS values and units module, including numeric data types, textual data types and functional notations\n- Box model and margin collapse\n- The containing block\n- Stacking and block-formatting contexts\n- Initial, computed, used, and actual values\n- CSS shorthand properties\n- CSS flexible box, multi-column and grid layout\n- Animation, transitions, and transforms.\n\n## Cookbook\nThe CSS layout cookbook aims to bring together recipes for common layout patterns, things you might need to implement in your sites. In addition to providing code you can use as a starting point in your projects, these recipes highlight the different ways layout specifications can be used and the choices you can make as a developer.\n\n## Tools for CSS development\n- You can use the W3C CSS Validation Service to check if your CSS is valid. This is an invaluable debugging tool.\n- Firefox Developer Tools lets you view and edit a page's live CSS via the Inspector and Style Editor tools.\n- The Web Developer extension for Firefox lets you track and edit live CSS on watched sites.\n\n## Meta bugs\nFirefox: Firefox bug 1323667\n\n## See also\n- Web languages to which CSS is often applied: HTML, SVG, MathML, XHTML, and XML.\n- Stack Overflow questions about CSS.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS", "title": "Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)", "description": "CSS is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML.

For example, one character set would store Japanese characters, and another would store the Arabic alphabet. If it was not clearly marked which parts of the data were in which character set, other programs and computers would display the text incorrectly, or damage it during processing. If you've ever seen text where characters like curly quotes (“”) were replaced with gibberish like `Ã‚Â£`, then you've seen this problem, known as Mojibake.\n\n## Common Encodings\nThe most common Unicode character encoding on the Web is UTF-8. Other encodings exist, like UTF-16 or the obsolete UCS-2, but UTF-8 is recommended.\n\n## See also\n- [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) on Wikipedia\n- [The Unicode Standard: A Technical Introduction](https://www.unicode.org/standard/principles.html)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Unicode", "title": "Unicode", "description": "Unicode is a standard character set that numbers and defines characters from the world's different languages, writing systems, and symbols.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 3, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 23:44:37", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Unicode", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "ogLocale": "en_US", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:image:type": "image/png", "og:image:width": "1920", "og:type": "website", "title": "Unicode - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN", "og:image:height": "1080", "ogDescription": "Unicode is a standard character set that numbers and defines characters from the world's different languages, writing systems, and symbols.", "og:locale": "en_US", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "ogTitle": "Unicode - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "language": "en-US", "og:title": "Unicode - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Unicode is a standard character set that numbers and defines characters from the world's different languages, writing systems, and symbols.", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "position": ["1", "2"], "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Unicode", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "og:description": "Unicode is a standard character set that numbers and defines characters from the world's different languages, writing systems, and symbols.", "scrapeId": "47780a33-16db-4f1d-8fe2-da3aebae4411", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Unicode", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Unicode", "statusCode": 200}}}

It's primarily intended for sending form data, but can be used independently of forms to transmit keyed data. The transmission is in the same format that the form's `submit()` method would use to send the data if the form's encoding type were set to \"multipart/form-data\".\n\n[Using FormData objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest_API/Using_FormData_Objects)\n\nProgressive web apps (PWAs) use modern web APIs along with traditional progressive enhancement strategy to create cross-platform web applications.

The Web is not the same as the Internet: the Web is one of many applications built on top of the Internet.\n\n## History\nTim Berners-Lee proposed the architecture of what became known as the World Wide Web. He created the first web [server](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Server), web [browser](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Browser), and webpage on his computer at the CERN physics research lab in 1990. In 1991, he announced his creation on the alt.hypertext newsgroup, marking the moment the Web was first made public.\n\n## Components of the Web\nThe system we know today as \"the Web\" consists of several components:\n\n- The **[HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP)** protocol governs data transfer between a server and a client.\n- To access a Web component, a client supplies a unique universal identifier, called a **[URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/URL)** (uniform resource locator) or [URI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/URI) (uniform resource identifier) (formally called Universal Document Identifier (UDI)).\n- **[HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML)** (hypertext markup language) is the most common format for publishing web documents.\n\n## Linking and Hyperlinks\nLinking, or connecting resources through [hyperlinks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hyperlink), is a defining concept of the Web, aiding its identity as a collection of connected documents.\n\n## W3C\nSoon after inventing the Web, Tim Berners-Lee founded the [W3C](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/W3C) (World Wide Web Consortium) to standardize and develop the Web further. This consortium consists of core Web interest groups, such as web browser developers, government entities, researchers, and universities. Its mission includes education and outreach.\n\n## See also\n- [Learn Web development](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development)\n- [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web) on Wikipedia\n- [The W3C website](https://www.w3.org/)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/World_Wide_Web", "title": "World Wide Web", "description": "The World Wide Web (WWW) is a system of interconnected public webpages accessible through the Internet, distinct from the Internet itself.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": false, "section_count": 6, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 23:46:03", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "description": "The World Wide Web—commonly referred to as WWW, W3, or the Web—is a system of interconnected public webpages accessible through the Internet.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)\"?\n\nAssistant: An IIFE is an idiom in which a JavaScript function runs as soon as it is defined, also known as a self-executing anonymous function.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Definition\nAn IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is an idiom in which a JavaScript function runs as soon as it is defined. It is also known as a self-executing anonymous function. The name IIFE is promoted by Ben Alman in his blog.\n\n## Code Examples\n```javascript\n// standard IIFE\n(function () {\n  // statements…\n})();\n\n// arrow function variant\n(() => {\n  // statements…\n})();\n\n// async IIFE\n(async () => {\n  // statements…\n})();\n```\n\n## Components of IIFE\nIt contains two major parts:\n\n1. A function expression. This usually needs to be enclosed in parentheses in order to be parsed correctly.\n2. Immediately calling the function expression. Arguments may be provided, though IIFEs without arguments are more common.\n\n## Use Cases\nIIFEs are a common pattern used to execute arbitrarily many statements in their own scope (and possibly return a value), in a location that requires a single expression. They are similar to, but much more powerful than, the comma operator, which can only execute multiple expressions and, therefore, does not provide a way to use local variables or control flow statements.\n\nUse cases of IIFEs include:\n- Avoiding polluting the global namespace by creating a new scope.\n- Creating a new async context to use `await` in a non-async context.\n- Computing values with complex logic, such as using multiple statements as a single expression.\n\n## See Also\n- [IIFE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediately-invoked_function_expression) (Wikipedia)\n- [Comma operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comma_operator)\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - [Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Function)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE", "title": "IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)", "description": "An IIFE is an idiom in which a JavaScript function runs as soon as it is defined, also known as a self-executing anonymous function.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 5, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 23:47:39", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE", "og:title": "IIFE - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN", "og:image:type": "image/png", "og:image:width": "1920", "ogDescription": "An IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is an idiom in which a JavaScript function runs as soon as it is defined.

Void elements only have a start tag; end tags must not be specified for void elements.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Definition\nA void element is an element in HTML that cannot have any child nodes (i.e., nested elements or text nodes). Void elements only have a start tag; end tags must not be specified for void elements.\n\n## HTML Specifications\nIn HTML, a void element must not have an end tag. For example, `<input type=\"text\"></input>` is invalid HTML. In contrast, SVG or MathML elements that cannot have any child nodes may use an end tag instead of XML self-closing-tag syntax in their start tag.\n\n## Void Elements in HTML\nThe void elements in HTML are as follows:\n\n- `<area>`\n- `<base>`\n- `<br>`\n- `<col>`\n- `<embed>`\n- `<hr>`\n- `<img>`\n- `<input>`\n- `<link>`\n- `<meta>`\n- `<param>` (Deprecated)\n- `<source>`\n- `<track>`\n- `<wbr>`\n\n## Self-closing tags\nSelf-closing tags (`<tag />`) do not exist in HTML. If a trailing `/` (slash) character is present in the start tag of an HTML element, HTML parsers ignore that slash character. This is especially important to remember for elements such as `<script>` or `<ul>` that do require a closing tag. In these cases, adding a trailing slash in the start tag does not close the element. Instead, the trailing slash is ignored, and the element is treated as open until an explicit closing tag is encountered or until the parser implicitly closes the element based on the HTML structure and parsing rules.\n\n## Note\nIf a trailing `/` (slash) character in a start tag is directly preceded by an unquoted attribute value — with no space between — the slash becomes a part of the attribute value rather than being discarded by the parser.\n\n## See also\n- [Replaced elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Replaced_element)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Void_element", "title": "Void element", "description": "A void element is an element in HTML that cannot have any child nodes (i.e., nested elements or text nodes).

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"HTML\"?\n\nAssistant: HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a descriptive language that specifies webpage structure.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Brief history\nIn 1990, as part of his vision of the Web, Tim Berners-Lee defined the concept of hypertext, which Berners-Lee formalized the following year through a markup mainly based on SGML. The IETF began formally specifying HTML in 1993, and after several drafts released version 2.0 in 1995. In 1994 Berners-Lee founded the W3C to develop the Web. In 1996, the W3C took over the HTML work and published the HTML 3.2 recommendation a year later. HTML 4.0 was released in 1999 and became an ISO standard in 2000.\n\nAt that time, the W3C nearly abandoned HTML in favor of XHTML, prompting the founding of an independent group called WHATWG in 2004. Thanks to WHATWG, work on HTML continued: the two organizations released the first draft of HTML5 in 2008 and an official standard in 2014. The term \"HTML5\" is just a buzzword referring to modern web technologies which are part of the HTML Living Standard.\n\n## Concept and syntax\nAn HTML document is a plaintext document structured with elements. Elements are surrounded by matching opening and closing tags. Each tag begins and ends with angle brackets (<>).

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Compile\"?\n\nAssistant: This page explains the process of compiling a computer program from one language to another, detailing the role of compilers and the types of compilation.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Definition of Compiling\nCompiling is the process of transforming a computer program written in a given language into a set of instructions in another format or language. A compiler is a computer program to execute that task.\n\n## Types of Compilation\nTypically, a compiler transforms code written in a higher-level language such as C++, Rust, or Java into executable (runnable) code — so-called binary code or machine code. WebAssembly, for example, is a form of executable binary code that can be compiled from code written in C++, Rust, C#, Go, Swift, and several other languages and run on any web page, with most features supported in modern browsers.\n\n## AOT vs JIT Compilation\nMost compilers perform either ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation or just-in-time (JIT) compilation. The GNU gcc compiler is one well-known example of an AOT compiler. AOT compilers are typically invoked from the command line in a shell environment or within an IDE. JIT compilers are typically not invoked directly but are instead built into software runtimes internally, for the purpose of improving performance.\n\n## Transpilers\nCompilers may also translate among higher-level languages — for example, from TypeScript to JavaScript — in which case, they are often sometimes referred to as transpilers.\n\n## See also\nCompiler on Wikipedia, WebAssembly, Related glossary terms: Just-In-Time (JIT)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Compile", "title": "Compile", "description": "This page explains the process of compiling a computer program from one language to another, detailing the role of compilers and the types of compilation.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 5, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 23:49:37", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"ogLocale": "en_US", "title": "Compile - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN", "ogDescription": "Compiling is the process of transforming a computer program written in a given language into a set of instructions in another format or language.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Domain sharding\"?\n\nAssistant: Domain sharding splits content across multiple subdomains to enable concurrent downloads of assets exceeding the limit of active connections for each domain.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Overview\nBrowsers limit the number of active connections for each domain. To enable concurrent downloads of assets exceeding that limit, domain sharding splits content across multiple subdomains. When multiple domains are used to serve multiple assets, browsers are able to download more resources simultaneously, resulting in a faster page load time and improved user experience.\n\n## Performance Considerations\nThe problem with domain sharding, in terms of performance, is the cost of extra DNS lookups for each domain and the overhead of establishing each TCP connection. The initial response from an HTTP request is generally an HTML file listing other resources such as JavaScript, CSS, images and other media files that need to be downloaded. As browsers limit the number of active connections per domain, serving all the required resources from a single domain could be slow as assets need to be downloaded sequentially. With domain sharding, the required downloads are served from more than one domain, enabling the browser to simultaneously download needed resources. Multiple domains, however, is an anti-pattern, as DNS lookups slow initial load times.\n\n## HTTP/2 and Domain Sharding\nHTTP2 supports unlimited concurrent requests making domain sharding an obsolete requirement when HTTP/2 is enabled.\n\n## See also\nRelated glossary terms:\n- TLS\n- DNS\n- HTTP/2\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Domain_sharding", "title": "Domain sharding", "description": "Domain sharding splits content across multiple subdomains to enable concurrent downloads of assets exceeding the limit of active connections for each domain.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 4, "timestamp": "2025-02-27 23:56:40", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:description": "Browsers limit the number of active connections for each domain.

The current version of the HTTP specification is called HTTP/2.\n\n## HTTP Schemes\nAs part of a URI, the \"http\" within \"http://example.com/\" is called a \"scheme\". Resources using the \"http\" schema are typically transported over unencrypted connections using the HTTP protocol. The \"https\" scheme (as in \"https://developer.mozilla.org\") indicates that a resource is transported using the HTTP protocol, but over a secure TLS channel.\n\n## Characteristics of HTTP\nHTTP is textual (all communication is done in plain text) and stateless (no communication is aware of previous communications). This property makes it ideal for humans to read documents (websites) on the world wide web. However, HTTP can also be used as a basis for REST web services from server to server or fetch() requests within websites to make them more dynamic.\n\n## See also\n- [HTTP on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP)\n- [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) on Wikipedia\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP", "title": "HTTP", "description": "The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the underlying network protocol that enables transfer of hypermedia documents on the Web, typically between a browser and a server.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": false, "section_count": 4, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 00:00:11", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"ogLocale": "en_US", "og:title": "HTTP - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP", "og:image:height": "1080", "og:type": "website", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "og:description": "The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the underlying network protocol that enables transfer of hypermedia documents on the Web, typically between a browser and a server so that humans can read them.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"RTP Control Protocol (RTCP)\"?\n\nAssistant: The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) is a partner to the RTP protocol. RTCP is used to provide control and statistical information about an RTP media streaming session.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Overview\nThe RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) is a partner to the RTP protocol. RTCP is used to provide control and statistical information about an RTP media streaming session.\n\nThis lets control and statistics packets be separated logically and functionally from the media streaming while using the underlying packet delivery layer to transmit the RTCP signals as well as the RTP and media contents.\n\nRTCP periodically transmits control packets to all of an RTP session's participants, using the same mechanism that is being used to transmit the data packets. That underlying protocol handles the multiplexing of the data and control packets and may use separate network ports for each type of packet.\n\n## See also\n- [Introduction to the Real-time Transport Protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Intro_to_RTP)\n- [RTP Control Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTP_Control_Protocol)\n- [RFC 3550, section 6: RFC 3550 Section 6](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3550#section-6)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/RTCP", "title": "RTP Control Protocol (RTCP)", "description": "The RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) is a partner to the RTP protocol.

Browser plugins are usually written using the NPAPI (Netscape Plugin Application Programming Interface) architecture.\n\nThe most well-known and widely used plugin was the now outdated Adobe Flash player, which enabled browsers to run Adobe Flash content.\n\nAs browsers have become more powerful, plugins have become less useful.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Control flow\"?\n\nAssistant: Control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Overview\nControl flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.\n\nCode is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.\n\n## Example of Control Flow\nFor example, imagine a script used to validate user data from a webpage form. The script submits validated data, but if the user, say, leaves a required field empty, the script prompts them to fill it in. To do this, the script uses a conditional structure or `if...else`, so that different code executes depending on whether the form is complete or not:\n\n```javascript\nif (isEmpty(field)) {\n  promptUser();\n} else {\n  submitForm();\n}\n```\n\n## Control Structures in Scripts\nA typical script in JavaScript or PHP (and the like) includes many control structures, including conditionals, loops and functions. Parts of a script may also be set to execute when events occur.\n\n## Complex Flows of Processing\nAs you can see, control structures can dictate complex flows of processing even with only a few lines of code. Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.\n\n## See also\n- [JavaScript Reference - Control flow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference#control_flow)\n- [Control flow and error handling](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Control_flow_and_error_handling)\n- [Control flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow) on Wikipedia\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Control_flow", "title": "Control flow", "description": "Control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 5, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 00:10:56", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Control_flow", "ogDescription": "Control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.", "title": "Control flow - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "og:title": "Control flow - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:type": "website", "og:image:type": "image/png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Control_flow", "og:description": "Control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.", "description": "Control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "og:locale": "en_US", "og:image:width": "1920", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "og:image:height": "1080", "position": ["1", "2"], "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "language": "en-US", "ogLocale": "en_US", "ogTitle": "Control flow - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN", "scrapeId": "18051153-add0-4644-8033-64aa8de46075", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Control_flow", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Control_flow", "statusCode": 200}}}

Depending on how strict an administrating organization might be, TLD often serves as a clue to the purpose, ownership, or nationality of a website.\n\n## Example\nConsider an example Internet address: https://developer.mozilla.org. Here org is the TLD; mozilla.org is the second-level domain name; and developer is a subdomain name. All together, these constitute a fully-qualified domain name; the addition of https:// makes this a complete URL.\n\n## Types of TLDs\nIANA today distinguishes the following groups of top-level domains:\n\n- country-code top-level domains (ccTLD): Two-character domains established for countries or territories. Example: .us for United States.\n- internationalized country code top-level domains (IDN ccTLD): ccTLDs in non-Latin character sets (e.g., Arabic or Chinese).\n- generic top-level domains (gTLD): Top-level domains with three or more characters.\n- unsponsored top-level domains: Domains that operate directly under policies established by ICANN processes for the global Internet community, for example \"com\" and \"edu\".\n- sponsored top-level domains (sTLD): These domains are proposed and sponsored by private organizations that decide whether an applicant is eligible to use the TLD, based on community theme concepts.\n- infrastructure top-level domain: This group consists of one domain, the Address and Routing Parameter Area (ARPA).\n\n## See also\n- TLD on Wikipedia\n- List of top-level domains\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/TLD", "title": "Top-Level Domain (TLD)", "description": "A TLD (top-level domain) is the most generic domain in the Internet's hierarchical DNS (domain name system).", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": false, "section_count": 5, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 00:11:31", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"ogLocale": "en_US", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "language": "en-US", "og:image:width": "1920", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "og:locale": "en_US", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:title": "TLD - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN", "description": "A TLD (top-level domain) is the most generic domain in the Internet's hierarchical DNS (domain name system).

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Forbidden request header\"?\n\nAssistant: A forbidden request header is an HTTP header name-value pair that cannot be set or modified programmatically in a request.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Definition\nA forbidden request header is an HTTP header name-value pair that cannot be set or modified programmatically in a request. For headers forbidden to be modified in responses, see forbidden response header name. Modifying such headers is forbidden because the user agent retains full control over them.\n\n## Example\nFor example, the `Date` header is a forbidden request header, so this code cannot set the message `Date` field:\n\n```javascript\nfetch(\"https://httpbin.org/get\", {\n  headers: {\n    Date: new Date().toUTCString(),\n  },\n});\n```\n\n## Reserved Headers\nNames starting with `Sec-` are reserved for creating new headers safe from APIs that grant developers control over headers, such as `fetch()`. Forbidden headers are one of the following:\n\n- `Accept-Charset`\n- `Accept-Encoding`\n- `Access-Control-Request-Headers`\n- `Access-Control-Request-Method`\n- `Connection`\n- `Content-Length`\n- `Cookie`\n- `Date`\n- `DNT`\n- `Expect`\n- `Host`\n- `Keep-Alive`\n- `Origin`\n- `Permissions-Policy`\n- `Proxy-` headers\n- `Sec-` headers\n- `Referer`\n- `TE`\n- `Trailer`\n- `Transfer-Encoding`\n- `Upgrade`\n- `Via`\n- `X-HTTP-Method`, but only when it contains a forbidden method name ( `CONNECT`, `TRACE`, `TRACK`)\n- `X-HTTP-Method-Override`, but only when it contains a forbidden method name\n- `X-Method-Override`, but only when it contains a forbidden method name\n\n## Notes\nThe `User-Agent` header used to be forbidden, but no longer is. However, Chrome still silently drops the header from Fetch requests (see Chromium bug 571722).\n\nWhile the `Referer` header is listed as a forbidden header in the spec, the user agent does not retain full control over it and the header can be programmatically modified. For example, when using `fetch()`, the `Referer` header can be programmatically modified via the `referrer` option.\n\n## See also\nRelated glossary terms:\n- Forbidden response header name\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Forbidden_request_header", "title": "Forbidden request header", "description": "A forbidden request header is an HTTP header name-value pair that cannot be set or modified programmatically in a request.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 5, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 00:11:53", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"ogTitle": "Forbidden request header - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "og:title": "Forbidden request header - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Forbidden_request_header", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "ogLocale": "en_US", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "og:image:type": "image/png", "title": "Forbidden request header - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Forbidden_request_header", "og:description": "A forbidden request header is an HTTP header name-value pair that cannot be set of modified programmatically in a request.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Polyfill\"?\n\nAssistant: A polyfill is a piece of code (usually JavaScript on the Web) used to provide modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## What is a Polyfill?\nA polyfill is a piece of code (usually JavaScript on the Web) used to provide modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it.\n\n## Examples of Polyfills\nFor example, a polyfill could be used to mimic the functionality of a [text-shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-shadow) in IE7 using proprietary IE filters, or mimic rem units or media queries by using JavaScript to dynamically adjust the styling as appropriate, or whatever else you require.\n\n## Why Use Polyfills?\nThe reason why polyfills are not used exclusively is for better functionality and better performance. Native implementations of APIs can do more and are faster than polyfills. For example, the [Object.create polyfill](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create#see_also) only contains the functionalities that are possible in a non-native implementation of Object.create.\n\n## Historical Context\nOther times, polyfills are used to address issues where browsers implement the same features in different ways. The polyfill uses non-standard features in a certain browser to give JavaScript a standards-compliant way to access the feature. Although this reason for polyfilling is very rare today, it was especially prevalent back in the days of IE6 and Netscape where each browser implemented JavaScript very differently. The [1st version of jQuery](https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.4/jquery.js) was an early example of a polyfill. It was essentially a compilation of browser-specific workarounds to provide JavaScript developers with a single common API that worked in all browsers. At the time, JavaScript developers were having major problems trying to get their website to work across all devices because there was such a discrepancy between browsers that the website might have to be programmed radically differently and have a much different user interface based upon the user's browser. Thus, the JavaScript developer had access to only a very tiny handful of JavaScript APIs that worked more-or-less consistently across all browsers. Using a polyfill to handle browser-specific implementations is less common today because modern browsers mostly implement a broad set of APIs according to standard semantics.\n\n## See also\n- [What is a polyfill?](https://remysharp.com/2010/10/08/what-is-a-polyfill) (article by Remy Sharp, the originator of the term)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Polyfill", "title": "Polyfill", "description": "A polyfill is a piece of code (usually JavaScript on the Web) used to provide modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": false, "section_count": 5, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 00:13:11", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:image:type": "image/png", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Polyfill", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "og:description": "A polyfill is a piece of code (usually JavaScript on the Web) used to provide modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it.", "position": ["1", "2"], "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "title": "Polyfill - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN", "og:type": "website", "language": "en-US", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "description": "A polyfill is a piece of code (usually JavaScript on the Web) used to provide modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it.", "og:title": "Polyfill - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN", "og:image:width": "1920", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "ogLocale": "en_US", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:locale": "en_US", "ogTitle": "Polyfill - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN", "og:image:height": "1080", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "ogDescription": "A polyfill is a piece of code (usually JavaScript on the Web) used to provide modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it.", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Polyfill", "scrapeId": "61b616e8-ab6a-49e9-a37c-1d69b6595c55", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Polyfill", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Polyfill", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Semantics\"?\n\nAssistant: In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code — for example \"what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?\", or \"what purpose or role does that HTML element have\" (rather than \"what does it look like?\").\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Semantics in JavaScript\nIn JavaScript, consider a function that takes a string parameter, and returns an `<li>` element with that string as its `textContent`. Would you need to look at the code to understand what the function did if it was called `build('Peach')`, or `createLiWithContent('Peach')`?\n\n## Semantics in CSS\nIn CSS, consider styling a list with `li` elements representing different types of fruits. Would you know what part of the DOM is being selected with `div > ul > li`, or `.fruits__item`?\n\n## Semantics in HTML\nIn HTML, for example, the [h1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements) element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of \"a top level heading on your page.\"\n\nBy default, most browser's [user agent stylesheet](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/Cascade#user-agent_stylesheets) will style an [h1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements) with a large font size to make it _look_ like a heading (although you could style it to look like anything you wanted).\n\nOn the other hand, you could make any element _look_ like a top level heading. Consider the following:\n\n```html\n<span style=\"font-size: 32px; margin: 21px 0;\">Not a top-level heading!</span>\n```\n\nThis will render it to look like a top level heading, but it has no semantic value, so it will not get any extra benefits as described above. It is therefore a good idea to use the right HTML element for the right job.\n\nHTML should be coded to represent the _data_ that will be populated and not based on its default presentation styling. Presentation (how it should look), is the sole responsibility of [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS).\n\nSome of the benefits from writing semantic markup are as follows:\n\n- Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings (see [SEO](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SEO))\n- Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page\n- Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching through endless `div` s with or without semantic or namespaced classes\n- Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated\n- Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming\n\nWhen approaching which markup to use, ask yourself, \"What element(s) best describe/represent the data that I'm going to populate?\" For example, is it a list of data?; ordered, unordered?; is it an article with sections and an aside of related information?; does it list out definitions?; is it a figure or image that needs a caption?; should it have a header and a footer in addition to the global site-wide header and footer?; etc.\n\n## Semantic elements\nThese are _some_ of the roughly 100 semantic [elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) available:\n\n- [`<article>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article)\n- [`<aside>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/aside)\n- [`<details>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details)\n- [`<figcaption>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figcaption)\n- [`<figure>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figure)\n- [`<footer>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/footer)\n- [`<form>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form)\n- [`<header>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header)\n- [`<main>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/main)\n- [`<mark>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/mark)\n- [`<nav>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav)\n- [`<section>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section)\n- [`<summary>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/summary)\n- [`<time>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/time)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics", "title": "Semantics", "description": "In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code — for example \"what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?\", or \"what purpose or role does that HTML element have\" (rather than \"what does it look like?\").", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 4, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 00:15:03", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "language": "en-US", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics", "ogDescription": "In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code — for example \"what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?\", or \"what purpose or role does that HTML element have\" (rather than \"what does it look like?\".)", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:image:type": "image/png", "og:image:height": "1080", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Semantics - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN", "og:locale": "en_US", "position": ["1", "2"], "ogTitle": "Semantics - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN", "og:title": "Semantics - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN", "description": "In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code — for example \"what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?\", or \"what purpose or role does that HTML element have\" (rather than \"what does it look like?\".)", "og:image:width": "1920", "og:description": "In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code — for example \"what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?\", or \"what purpose or role does that HTML element have\" (rather than \"what does it look like?\".)", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "ogLocale": "en_US", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "og:type": "website", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "scrapeId": "5bf33d4f-0a1b-4c10-b4d6-e578262fb09c", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Gutters\"?\n\nAssistant: Gutters or alleys are spacing between content tracks. These can be created in CSS grid layout using the column-gap, row-gap, or gap properties.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Example\nIn the example below we have a three-column and two-row track grid, with `20px` gaps between both column tracks and row tracks.\n\n```\n* {\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n}\n\n.wrapper {\n  border: 2px solid #f76707;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  background-color: #fff4e6;\n}\n\n.wrapper > div {\n  border: 2px solid #ffa94d;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  background-color: #fff8f8;\n  padding: 1em;\n  color: #d9480f;\n}\n```\n\n```\n.wrapper {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1.2fr);\n  grid-auto-rows: 45%;\n  column-gap: 20px;\n  row-gap: 20px;\n}\n```\n\n```\n<div class=\"wrapper\">\n  <div>One</div>\n  <div>Two</div>\n  <div>Three</div>\n  <div>Four</div>\n  <div>Five</div>\n</div>\n```\n\nIn terms of grid sizing, gaps act as if they were a regular grid track however nothing can be placed into the gap. The gap acts as if the grid line at that location has gained extra size, so any grid item placed after that line begins at the end of the gap.\n\nThe `row-gap` and `column-gap` properties are not the only things that can cause tracks to space out. Margins, padding, or the use of the space distribution properties in CSS box alignment can all contribute to the visible gap – therefore the `row-gap` and `column-gap` properties should not be seen as equal to the \"gutter size\" unless you know that your design has not introduced any additional space with one of these methods.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Gutters", "title": "Gutters", "description": "Gutters or alleys are spacing between content tracks.

You'll set up the tools you need to construct a basic webpage and publish your own code.\n\n## HTML tutorials\nOur introductory HTML learning module teaches HTML from the ground up — no previous knowledge required. It sets the stage, getting you used to important concepts and syntax, looking at applying HTML to text, how to create hyperlinks, and how to use HTML to structure a webpage.\n\n## Advanced HTML topics\nForms are a very important part of the Web — these provide much of the functionality you need for interacting with websites, such as registering and logging in, sending feedback, buying products, and more. This module gets you started with creating the client-side parts of forms.\n\n## CSS tutorials\nCSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code you use to style your webpage. CSS Basics takes you through what you need to get started. We'll answer questions like: How do I make my text black or red? How do I make my content show up in such-and-such a place on the screen? How do I decorate my webpage with background images and colors?\n\n## JavaScript tutorials\nIn this module, we continue our coverage of all JavaScript's key fundamental features, turning our attention to commonly-encountered types of code blocks such as conditional statements, loops, functions, and events.\n\n## Extension Development\nWebExtensions is a cross-browser system for developing browser add-ons. To a large extent, the system is compatible with the extension API supported by Google Chrome and Opera.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Tutorials", "title": "MDN Tutorials", "description": "The links on this page lead to a variety of tutorials and learning materials for web development, suitable for beginners, intermediates, and experts.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 6, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 00:18:46", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:description": "The links on this page lead to a variety of tutorials and learning materials.\nWhether you are a beginner, intermediate, or expert at web development, you will find something helpful here.", "title": "Web development tutorials - MDN Web Docs | MDN", "ogLocale": "en_US", "language": "en-US", "ogTitle": "Web development tutorials - MDN Web Docs | MDN", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:image:type": "image/png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "og:locale": "en_US", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "ogDescription": "The links on this page lead to a variety of tutorials and learning materials.\nWhether you are a beginner, intermediate, or expert at web development, you will find something helpful here.", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Tutorials", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "og:title": "Web development tutorials - MDN Web Docs | MDN", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "description": "The links on this page lead to a variety of tutorials and learning materials.\nWhether you are a beginner, intermediate, or expert at web development, you will find something helpful here.", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "og:type": "website", "position": ["1", "2"], "og:image:height": "1080", "og:image:width": "1920", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Tutorials", "scrapeId": "33a9860e-db24-402f-9538-9b0a11979744", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Tutorials", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Tutorials", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"HTML (HyperText Markup Language)\"?\n\nAssistant: HTML is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Introduction to HTML\nHTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript). \"Hypertext\" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web. HTML uses \"markup\" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special \"elements\" such as <head>, <title>, <body>, <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, <p>, <div>, <span>, <img>, <aside>, <audio>, <canvas>, <datalist>, <details>, <embed>, <nav>, <search>, <output>, <progress>, <video>, <ul>, <ol>, <li> and many others.\n\n## HTML Elements and Tags\nAn HTML element is set off from other text in a document by \"tags\", which consist of the element name surrounded by < and >. The name of an element inside a tag is case-insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the <title> tag can be written as <Title>, <TITLE>, or in any other way. However, the convention and recommended practice is to write tags in lowercase.\n\n## Learning Resources\nThe articles below can help you learn more about HTML.\n\n## Beginner's tutorials\nYour first website: Creating the content - This article provides a brief tour of what HTML is and how to use it, aimed at people who are completely new to web development. Structuring content with HTML - Our Learn web development section's HTML module teaches all the HTML fundamentals from the ground up.\n\n## Guides\nHTML forms - Forms are a very important part of the Web — these provide much of the functionality you need for interacting with websites, e.g. registering and logging in, sending feedback, buying products, and more. This module gets you started with creating the client-side/front-end parts of forms. CORS enabled image - The crossorigin attribute, in combination with an appropriate CORS header, allows images defined by the <img> element to be loaded from foreign origins and used in a <canvas> element as if they were being loaded from the current origin. CORS settings attributes - Some HTML elements that provide support for CORS, such as <img> or <video>, have a crossorigin attribute (crossOrigin property), which lets you configure the CORS requests for the element's fetched data. Preloading content with rel=\"preload\" - The preload value of the <link> element's rel attribute allows you to write declarative fetch requests in your HTML <head>, specifying resources that your pages will need very soon after loading, which you therefore want to start preloading early in the lifecycle of a page load, before the browser's main rendering machinery kicks in. This ensures that they are made available earlier and are less likely to block the page's first render, leading to performance improvements. This article provides a basic guide to how preload works. Responsive images - In this article, we'll learn about the concept of responsive images — images that work well on devices with widely differing screen sizes, resolutions, and other such features — and look at what tools HTML provides to help implement them. This helps to improve performance across different devices.\n\n## Reference\nHTML consists of elements, each of which may be modified by some number of attributes. HTML documents are connected to each other with links. HTML element reference - Browse a list of all HTML elements. HTML attribute reference - Elements in HTML have attributes. These are additional values that configure the elements or adjust their behavior in various ways. Global attributes - Global attributes may be specified on all HTML elements, even those not specified in the standard. This means that any non-standard elements must still permit these attributes, even though those elements make the document HTML5-noncompliant. Inline-level elements and block-level elements - HTML elements are usually \"inline-level\" or \"block-level\" elements. An inline-level element occupies only the space bounded by the tags that define it. A block-level element occupies the entire space of its parent element (container), thereby creating a \"block box\". HTML comments - HTML comments are used to add explanatory notes to the markup or to prevent the browser from interpreting specific parts of the document. Guide to media types and formats on the web - The <audio> and <video> elements allow you to play audio and video media natively within your content without the need for external software support. HTML content categories - HTML is comprised of several kinds of content, each of which is allowed to be used in certain contexts and is disallowed in others. Similarly, each context has a set of other content categories it can contain and elements that can or can't be used in them. This is a guide to these categories. Quirks mode and standards mode - Historical information on quirks mode and standards mode.\n\n## Related topics\nApplying color to HTML elements using CSS - This article covers most of the ways you use CSS to add color to HTML content, listing what parts of HTML documents can be colored and what CSS properties to use when doing so.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML", "title": "HTML (HyperText Markup Language)", "description": "HTML is the most basic building block of the Web.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Scope\"?\n\nAssistant: The scope is the current context of execution in which values and expressions are 'visible' or can be referenced.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Understanding Scope\nThe scope is the current context of execution in which values and expressions are 'visible' or can be referenced. If a variable or expression is not in the current scope, it will not be available for use. Scopes can also be layered in a hierarchy, so that child scopes have access to parent scopes, but not vice versa.\n\n## Types of Scopes in JavaScript\nJavaScript has the following kinds of scopes:\n\n- Global scope: The default scope for all code running in script mode.\n- Module scope: The scope for code running in module mode.\n- Function scope: The scope created with a function.\n\nIn addition, identifiers declared with certain syntaxes, including `let`, `const`, `class`, or (in strict mode) `function`, can belong to an additional scope:\n\n- Block scope: The scope created with a pair of curly braces (a block).\n\n## Function Scope Example\nA function creates a scope, so that (for example) a variable defined exclusively within the function cannot be accessed from outside the function or within other functions. For instance, the following is invalid:\n\n```javascript\nfunction exampleFunction() {\n  const x = \"declared inside function\"; // x can only be used in exampleFunction\n  console.log(\"Inside function\");\n  console.log(x);\n}\n\nconsole.log(x); // Causes error\n```\n\nHowever, the following code is valid due to the variable being declared outside the function, making it global:\n\n```javascript\nconst x = \"declared outside function\";\n\nexampleFunction();\n\nfunction exampleFunction() {\n  console.log(\"Inside function\");\n  console.log(x);\n}\n\nconsole.log(\"Outside function\");\nconsole.log(x);\n```\n\n## Block Scope Example\nBlocks only scope `let` and `const` declarations, but not `var` declarations.\n\n```javascript\n{\n  var x = 1;\n}\nconsole.log(x); // 1\n```\n\n```javascript\n{\n  const x = 1;\n}\nconsole.log(x); // ReferenceError: x is not defined\n```\n\n## See Also\n- [Scope (computer science)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science)) on Wikipedia\n- [Block scoping rules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/block#block_scoping_rules_with_let_const_class_or_function_declaration_in_strict_mode)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scope", "title": "Scope", "description": "The scope is the current context of execution in which values and expressions are 'visible' or can be referenced.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 5, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 00:24:07", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:locale": "en_US", "description": "The scope is the current context of execution in which values and expressions are \"visible\" or can be referenced.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"eTLD\"?\n\nAssistant: The term eTLD stands for 'effective top-level domain' and is a domain under which domains can be registered by a single organization.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Definition of eTLD\nThe term **eTLD** stands for \"effective top-level domain\" and is a domain under which domains can be registered by a single organization.\n\nA top level domain (TLD) is the part of the domain name following the final dot: so for example, the top-level domain in `crookedtimber.org` is `org`.\n\n## Example of eTLD\nSuppose only domains directly under top-level domains were registrable by single organizations. Then you would know that the following domains all belonged to the same organization:\n```\n    xyz.org\nabc.xyz.org\ndef.xyz.org\n```\n\nHowever, this does not work as a general rule, because many registrars allow organizations to register domains at levels below the top level. This means that, for example, `sussex.ac.uk` and `aber.ac.uk` are owned by different organizations.\n\n## Public Suffix List\nBecause this is a matter of the registrar's policies, it's impossible to tell algorithmically whether a given domain name suffix (like `ac.uk`) is publicly registrable or not. The [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/) is a list of all suffixes under which organizations can directly register names: that is, it is a list of eTLDs.\n\n## eTLD+1\nThe related concept **eTLD+1** means an eTLD plus the next part of the domain name. Because eTLD+1s are registrable, all domains with the same eTLD+1 are owned by the same organization.\n\nFor example, all the following are eTLD+1 domains:\n- crookedtimber.org\n- theguardian.com\n- sussex.ac.uk\n- aber.ac.uk\n\nThis means that all domains under each of these domains belong to the same organization. For example:\n```\n film.theguardian.com\nmusic.theguardian.com\n```\n```\n      news.sussex.ac.uk\n      blog.sussex.ac.uk\nadmissions.sussex.ac.uk\n```\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/eTLD", "title": "eTLD", "description": "The term eTLD stands for 'effective top-level domain' and is a domain under which domains can be registered by a single organization.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 4, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 00:24:28", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"language": "en-US", "position": ["1", "2"], "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/eTLD", "og:image:type": "image/png", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:image:width": "1920", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/eTLD", "title": "eTLD - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN", "ogDescription": "The term eTLD stands for \"effective top-level domain\" and is a domain under which domains can be registered by a single organization.", "ogLocale": "en_US", "og:title": "eTLD - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN", "og:locale": "en_US", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:type": "website", "ogTitle": "eTLD - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN", "og:image:height": "1080", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:description": "The term eTLD stands for \"effective top-level domain\" and is a domain under which domains can be registered by a single organization.", "description": "The term eTLD stands for \"effective top-level domain\" and is a domain under which domains can be registered by a single organization.", "scrapeId": "d329fce1-3047-493a-97ff-6d9e21bdc49c", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/eTLD", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/eTLD", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Open Source Etiquette\"?\n\nAssistant: Guidelines for contributing to open source projects, focusing on respectful communication and effective contributions.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Think about why you are contributing to an OSP\nBefore you start contributing to an open source project, ask yourself why you want to do that. It's fine if the answer to this question is \"I want something to do with my time\", but even better reasons might include:\n\n- I want to improve my skills.\n- I use this tool all the time and found a bug in it or I want to help make it better.\n- I want to help other people use the tool more successfully.\n- I want to help other people contribute to the project more successfully.\n- I want to publicly demonstrate my own skills for my college or university course or to improve my chances of getting a job.\n\nSome of these reasons are self-serving, and that's fine! Having a clear set of reasons for contributing will make you more productive and make it easier to work with the community.\n\n## Be polite, be kind, avoid incendiary or offensive language\nWe could abbreviate this to \"be kind\". This is our number one bit of advice for anyone starting open source contributions. Be kind to the other contributors on the project, and it will be a happier and more productive place.\n\n- Thank people if they help you.\n- Congratulate people where appropriate, like if they land a pull request, or fix a difficult bug.\n- Always respond respectfully, even if you feel like the answer to a question was obvious or that someone is repeating themselves.\n- Try to help people to do better in a supportive way. For example, saying \"this is wrong\" or \"here is the answer\" is not as helpful as saying \"This is OK, but I feel that it would be better if we did it more like this, here's a blog post for more ideas\" or \"you can find the answer here; also check out this link for more common answers\".\n\nContributors are here because they want to make a positive impact on the project. Beyond that, don't make assumptions, such as:\n\n- Knowledge of the project and the technologies used to build it\n- Gender, sexuality, age, languages spoken, location, political views, religion, or other personal attributes\n- Experience with open source projects\n- Confidence level\n- Expectations\n- Sense of humor\n\nYou should keep what you write on topic and avoid controversial subjects, such as religion or politics. Refrain from swearing or potentially offensive language. It rarely improves communication, and can make it harder for others to participate.\n\nBe supportive and respectful even if you disagree with someone, or don't like a decision they've made. Be aware that there are rules in place in any good OSP to protect its contributors against being made to feel uncomfortable while contributing. This usually can be found in a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file on GitHub (see mdn/content CODE_OF_CONDUCT for an example).\n\nMDN's repos are governed by the wide-reaching Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines (CPG). Usually mildly offensive behavior on MDN Web Docs repos (such as constantly being off-topic/disruptive, or being rude) will be first responded to with a warning, followed by a final warning, then a temporary or permanent ban. More serious behavioral problems such as hate speech or threats against another contributor will not be tolerated, and will likely result in an instant ban.\n\nIf you receive anything that makes you feel uncomfortable, you should always report it using the mechanism provided on the code of conduct.\n\n## Choose effective contributions\nThink about what you want to do on the project. For example, we have a large list of issues filed at on the contributors task board, broken up by various task types. You could also contribute by opening pull requests to fix problems that you come across while reading MDN articles.\n\nA lot of the work on MDN revolves around writing documentation and code examples, but there are other ways to contribute too. This could be helping to triage issues that come in, fixing typos, fixing grammar to make pages more understandable, or mentoring people that are trying to make fixes. Every fix is useful, no matter how small, and we won't turn any away. Nevertheless, try to make sure your fixes are productive. We'd like to advise against these kinds of contributions:\n\n- Updating code style, language in prose, or testing framework because you like it better.\n- Changing pages from US English to British English.\n- Adding or removing punctuation when the original is correct.\n\nIn many cases, things are like they are on OSPs for a reason. You should read style guides if they have one, and if in doubt about whether something is productive, always ask first!\n\n## Read the manual\nGood OSPs will always make contributor documentation readily available. On GitHub projects, it is usually in the repo's CONTRIBUTING.md file, or sometimes in the project's README.md file. Being a documentation project, MDN content has a README and a decent set of contributor docs on the site itself (see Community resources).\n\nDon't be afraid to ask for help, but always try to find the answer to your question first before asking. This way you build up your knowledge of the project and become more independent, and don't put unnecessary burden on the other contributors. If an explanation is hard to find or not described very well, file an issue, or create a pull request to try to fix it yourself.\n\n## Find out where to ask questions\nFind out where the best place is to ask questions. Good OSPs will always make this clear in their docs (see Get in touch). If you want to ask general questions, then always make use of these channels. Don't file an issue on GitHub for every question, as it adds noise to the project.\n\n## Make progress, not noise\nThink carefully about the way you handle communication in the project — make sure it is useful, and that it doesn't make other contributor's jobs harder. Submitting pull requests to fix bugs is great, but be sure they are useful or easy to review. Filing issues and joining in other conversations is fine, but are your issues and comments on topic, or are they adding noise?\n\nAs a rule, do:\n\n- Discuss one topic per issue — it is easy to keep issues focused and productive.\n- Fix one issue per PR — it may be slightly more work for you, but it is much easier to review a single clear fix.\n- Contribute to other threads if you have a useful point to make or can answer someone else's question.\n- Ask questions using other mechanisms like chat rooms or forums if you are not sure whether something is useful or have a simple question.\n- Read the manual first to try to answer the question yourself before asking it.\n\nDon't:\n\n- Complicate issues by trying to discuss multiple topics at once, or making off-topic comments.\n- Try to cram multiple fixes into a single pull request. It makes it a lot harder to review, and raises suspicions (some people might think you are trying to hide some malicious code in between the valid changes).\n- Open lots of issues asking vague questions.\n- Ask questions without trying to solve the problem yourself first.\n\n## OSPs are a democracy (almost)\nOSPs are quite democratic — many decisions are voted on, and you are largely free to contribute how you want, as long as you don't impede anyone else from contributing.\n\nHowever, some things will be largely decided by a small group of core contributors. You are free to make a case against any decision, but sometimes a moderator will make a call that goes against your opinion. You need to respect and accept these decisions.\n\nIt is useful to get to know any project's moderators, so you know who best to ask for help, for example in pull requests or issue threads.\n\n## Be patient, be timely\nBear in mind that many people working on OSPs are doing it in their free time, without payment, and all people working on OSPs are generally very busy. If you are waiting for something like a pull request review, or an answer to a question, be patient.\n\nIt is reasonable to wait a few days and then ping someone politely to ask if they've had time to look at it. If they happen to be too busy, it may be best to wait a further week and try following up with them then.\n\nIt is not reasonable or polite to demand things like a quick reply.\n\nIf someone is waiting for you to do something for them, you should be extended the same courtesy, but at the same time, try to respond as promptly as you can. If you really can't find the time, let them know, and ask the maintainers to help you find someone else to do the task.\n\n## See also\n- [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)\n- [More general freeCodeCamp \"How to contribute to open source\" list](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/how-to-contribute-to-open-source)\n- [Getting started with contributing to open source](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/08/03/getting-started-with-contributing-to-open-source/)\n- [Google Engineering Practices Documentation](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/) on google.github.io/eng-practices\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Open_source_etiquette", "title": "Open Source Etiquette", "description": "Guidelines for contributing to open source projects, focusing on respectful communication and effective contributions.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 9, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 00:25:19", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"title": "Open source etiquette - MDN Web Docs | MDN", "og:locale": "en_US", "og:image:height": "1080", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Open_source_etiquette", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "og:description": "If you've not worked on an open source project (OSP) before, it is a good idea to read this article before starting to contribute to MDN Web Docs and other open source projects.\nThere are a few behaviors to adopt that will help you and the other project contributors feel valued and safe, and stay productive.\nThis article won't teach you everything about contributing to open source; the aim is to cover foundational topics for taking part in open source communities.", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "og:type": "website", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "ogLocale": "en_US", "og:title": "Open source etiquette - MDN Web Docs | MDN", "ogTitle": "Open source etiquette - MDN Web Docs | MDN", "ogDescription": "If you've not worked on an open source project (OSP) before, it is a good idea to read this article before starting to contribute to MDN Web Docs and other open source projects.\nThere are a few behaviors to adopt that will help you and the other project contributors feel valued and safe, and stay productive.\nThis article won't teach you everything about contributing to open source; the aim is to cover foundational topics for taking part in open source communities.", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "description": "If you've not worked on an open source project (OSP) before, it is a good idea to read this article before starting to contribute to MDN Web Docs and other open source projects.\nThere are a few behaviors to adopt that will help you and the other project contributors feel valued and safe, and stay productive.\nThis article won't teach you everything about contributing to open source; the aim is to cover foundational topics for taking part in open source communities.", "og:image:width": "1920", "position": ["1", "2", "3"], "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Open_source_etiquette", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:image:type": "image/png", "language": "en-US", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "scrapeId": "f8a41c8c-0261-4b18-9400-ba3003cf0723", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Open_source_etiquette", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Open_source_etiquette", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA)\"?\n\nAssistant: This page covers the roles and attributes of ARIA that help make web content and applications more accessible to people with disabilities.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Introduction to ARIA\nAccessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) is a set of roles and attributes that define ways to make web content and web applications (especially those developed with JavaScript) more accessible to people with disabilities. It supplements HTML so that interactions and widgets commonly used in applications can be passed to assistive technologies when there is not otherwise a mechanism. For example, ARIA enables accessible JavaScript widgets, form hints and error messages, live content updates, and more.\n\n## Warning\nMany of these widgets are fully supported in modern browsers. Developers should prefer using the correct semantic HTML element over using ARIA, if such an element exists. For instance, native elements have built-in keyboard accessibility, roles and states. However, if you choose to use ARIA, you are responsible for mimicking the equivalent browser behavior in script.\n\n## The first rule of ARIA\nThe first rule of ARIA use is \"If you can use a native HTML element or attribute with the semantics and behavior you require already built in, instead of re-purposing an element and adding an ARIA role, state or property to make it accessible, then do so.\"\n\n## Note on ARIA\nThere is a saying \"No ARIA is better than bad ARIA.\" In WebAim's survey of over one million home pages, they found that Home pages with ARIA present averaged 41% more detected errors than those without ARIA. While ARIA is designed to make web pages more accessible, if used incorrectly, it can do more harm than good.\n\n## Progress Bar Widget Example\nHere's the markup for a progress bar widget:\n\n```html\n<div\n  id=\"percent-loaded\"\n  role=\"progressbar\"\n  aria-valuenow=\"75\"\n  aria-valuemin=\"0\"\n  aria-valuemax=\"100\"></div>\n```\n\nThis progress bar is built using a `<div>`, which has no meaning. We include ARIA roles and properties to add meaning. In this example, the `role=\"progressbar\"` attribute informs the browser that this element is actually a JavaScript-powered progress bar widget. The `aria-valuemin` and `aria-valuemax` attributes specify the minimum and maximum values for the progress bar, and the `aria-valuenow` describes the current state of it and therefore must be kept updated with JavaScript.\n\n## Dynamic ARIA Attributes Example\nAlong with placing them directly in the markup, ARIA attributes can be added to the element and updated dynamically using JavaScript code like this:\n\n```javascript\n// Find the progress bar <div> in the DOM.\nconst progressBar = document.getElementById(\"percent-loaded\");\n\n// Set its ARIA roles and states,\n// so that assistive technologies know what kind of widget it is.\nprogressBar.setAttribute(\"role\", \"progressbar\");\nprogressBar.setAttribute(\"aria-valuemin\", 0);\nprogressBar.setAttribute(\"aria-valuemax\", 100);\n\n// Create a function that can be called at any time to update\n// the value of the progress bar.\nfunction updateProgress(percentComplete) {\n  progressBar.setAttribute(\"aria-valuenow\", percentComplete);\n}\n```\n\n## Native Progress Element Example\nIt would have been much simpler to use the native `<progress>` element instead:\n\n```html\n<progress id=\"percent-loaded\" value=\"75\" max=\"100\">75 %</progress>\n```\n\n**Note:** The `min` attribute is not allowed for the `<progress>` element; its minimum value is always `0`.\n\n## HTML Landmark Elements\nHTML landmark elements ( `<main>`, `<header>`, `<nav>`, etc.) have built-in implicit ARIA roles, so there is no need to duplicate them.\n\n## Support\nLike any other web technology, there are varying degrees of support for ARIA. Support is based on the operating system and browser being used, as well as the kind of assistive technology interfacing with it. In addition, the version of the operating system, browser, and assistive technology are contributing factors. Older software versions may not support certain ARIA roles, have only partial support, or misreport its functionality.\n\n## Testing ARIA\nIt is also important to test your authored ARIA with actual assistive technology. This is because browser emulators and simulators are not really effective for testing full support. Similarly, proxy assistive technology solutions are not sufficient to fully guarantee functionality.\n\n## References\nARIA roles\nReference pages covering all the WAI-ARIA roles discussed on MDN.\n\nARIA states and properties\nReference pages covering all the WAI-ARIA states and properties discussed on MDN.\n\n## Standardization Efforts\nWAI-ARIA specification\nThe W3C specification itself.\n\nWAI-ARIA authoring practices\nThe official best practices documents how best to ARIA-ify common widgets and interactions. An excellent resource.\n\n## ARIA for Scripted Widgets\nWriting keyboard-navigable JavaScript widgets\nBuilt-in elements like `<input>`, `<button>`, etc. have built-in keyboard accessibility. If you 'fake' these with `<div>`s and ARIA, you must ensure your widgets are keyboard accessible.\n\n## Live Regions\nLive regions provide suggestions to screen readers about how to handle changes to the contents of a page.\n\n## Videos\nThe following talks are a great way to understand ARIA:\n\n[ARIA, Accessibility APIs and coding like you give a damn! – Léonie Watson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdB8SRhqvFc)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA", "title": "Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA)", "description": "This page covers the roles and attributes of ARIA that help make web content and applications more accessible to people with disabilities.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 15, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 00:25:40", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:image:width": "1920", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "language": "en-US", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA", "ogDescription": "Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) is a set of roles and attributes that define ways to make web content and web applications (especially those developed with JavaScript) more accessible to people with disabilities.", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "description": "Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) is a set of roles and attributes that define ways to make web content and web applications (especially those developed with JavaScript) more accessible to people with disabilities.", "og:image:height": "1080", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "position": ["1", "2", "3"], "ogLocale": "en_US", "og:description": "Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) is a set of roles and attributes that define ways to make web content and web applications (especially those developed with JavaScript) more accessible to people with disabilities.", "og:type": "website", "ogTitle": "ARIA - Accessibility | MDN", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "og:locale": "en_US", "title": "ARIA - Accessibility | MDN", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:image:type": "image/png", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "og:title": "ARIA - Accessibility | MDN", "scrapeId": "5bc3bc3c-21bd-419e-ad36-5eeeaf86611c", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"MIME types\"?\n\nAssistant: A media type (also known as a Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions or MIME type) indicates the nature and format of a document, file, or assortment of bytes.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Structure of a MIME type\nA MIME type most commonly consists of just two parts: a type and a subtype, separated by a slash ( /) — with no whitespace between:\n\ntype/subtype\n\nThe type represents the general category into which the data type falls, such as video or text.\n\nThe subtype identifies the exact kind of data of the specified type the MIME type represents. For example, for the MIME type text, the subtype might be plain (plain text), html (HTML source code), or calendar (for iCalendar/.ics) files.\n\nEach type has its own set of possible subtypes. A MIME type always has both a type and a subtype, never just one or the other.\n\nAn optional parameter can be added to provide additional details:\n\ntype/subtype;parameter=value\n\nFor example, for any MIME type whose main type is text, you can add the optional charset parameter to specify the character set used for the characters in the data. If no charset is specified, the default is ASCII (US-ASCII) unless overridden by the user agent's settings. To specify a UTF-8 text file, the MIME type text/plain;charset=UTF-8 is used.\n\nMIME types are case-insensitive but are traditionally written in lowercase. The parameter values can be case-sensitive.\n\n## Types\nThere are two classes of type: discrete and multipart. Discrete types are types which represent a single file or medium, such as a single text or music file, or a single video. A multipart type represents a document that's comprised of multiple component parts, each of which may have its own individual MIME type; or, a multipart type may encapsulate multiple files being sent together in one transaction. For example, multipart MIME types are used when attaching multiple files to an email.\n\n## Discrete types\nThe discrete types currently registered with the IANA are:\n\napplication\n\nAny kind of binary data that doesn't fall explicitly into one of the other types; either data that will be executed or interpreted in some way or binary data that requires a specific application or category of application to use. Generic binary data (or binary data whose true type is unknown) is application/octet-stream. Other common examples include application/pdf, application/pkcs8, and application/zip.\n\naudio\n\nAudio or music data. Examples include audio/mpeg, audio/vorbis.\n\nexample\n\nReserved for use as a placeholder in examples showing how to use MIME types. These should never be used outside of sample code listings and documentation. example can also be used as a subtype; for instance, in an example related to working with audio on the web, the MIME type audio/example can be used to indicate that the type is a placeholder and should be replaced with an appropriate one when using the code in the real world.\n\nfont\n\nFont/typeface data. Common examples include font/woff, font/ttf, and font/otf.\n\nimage\n\nImage or graphical data including both bitmap and vector still images as well as animated versions of still image formats such as animated GIF or APNG. Common examples are image/jpeg, image/png, and image/svg+xml.\n\nmodel\n\nModel data for a 3D object or scene. Examples include model/3mf and model/vrml.\n\ntext\n\nText-only data including any human-readable content, source code, or textual data such as comma-separated value (CSV) formatted data. Examples include: text/plain, text/csv, and text/html.\n\nvideo\n\nVideo data or files, such as MP4 movies (video/mp4).\n\n## Multipart types\nMultipart types indicate a category of document broken into pieces, often with different MIME types; they can also be used — especially in email scenarios — to represent multiple, separate files which are all part of the same transaction. They represent a composite document.\n\nExcept for multipart/form-data, used in the POST method of HTML Forms, and multipart/byteranges, used with 206 Partial Content to send part of a document, HTTP doesn't handle multipart documents in a special way: the message is transmitted to the browser (which will likely show a \"Save As\" window if it doesn't know how to display the document).\n\n## Important MIME types for Web developers\napplication/octet-stream\n\nThis is the default for binary files. As it means unknown binary file, browsers usually don't execute it, or even ask if it should be executed. They treat it as if the Content-Disposition header was set to attachment, and propose a \"Save As\" dialog.\n\ntype/plain\n\nThis is the default for textual files. Even if it really means \"unknown textual file,\" browsers assume they can display it.\n\n## MIME sniffing\nIn the absence of a MIME type, or in certain cases where browsers believe they are incorrect, browsers may perform MIME sniffing — guessing the correct MIME type by looking at the bytes of the resource. Each browser performs MIME sniffing differently and under different circumstances. (For example, Safari will look at the file extension in the URL if the sent MIME type is unsuitable.) There are security concerns as some MIME types represent executable content. Servers can prevent MIME sniffing by sending the X-Content-Type-Options header.\n\n## Other methods of conveying document type\nMIME types are not the only way to convey document type information:\n\nFilename suffixes are sometimes used, especially on Microsoft Windows. Not all operating systems consider these suffixes meaningful (such as Linux and macOS), and there is no guarantee they are correct.\n\nMagic numbers. The syntax of different formats allows file-type inference by looking at their byte structure. For example, GIF files start with the 47 49 46 38 39 hexadecimal value (GIF89), and PNG files with 89 50 4E 47 (.PNG). Not all file types have magic numbers, so this is not 100% reliable either.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/MIME_types", "title": "MIME types", "description": "A media type (also known as a Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions or MIME type) indicates the nature and format of a document, file, or assortment of bytes.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 7, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 00:26:39", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:image:type": "image/png", "og:image:height": "1080", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "language": "en-US", "ogDescription": "A media type (also known as a Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions or MIME type) indicates the nature and format of a document, file, or assortment of bytes.\nMIME types are defined and standardized in IETF's RFC 6838.", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/MIME_types", "ogTitle": "MIME types (IANA media types) - HTTP | MDN", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "og:title": "MIME types (IANA media types) - HTTP | MDN", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/MIME_types", "og:image:width": "1920", "ogLocale": "en_US", "og:type": "website", "og:locale": "en_US", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "og:description": "A media type (also known as a Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions or MIME type) indicates the nature and format of a document, file, or assortment of bytes.\nMIME types are defined and standardized in IETF's RFC 6838.", "description": "A media type (also known as a Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions or MIME type) indicates the nature and format of a document, file, or assortment of bytes.\nMIME types are defined and standardized in IETF's RFC 6838.", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "title": "MIME types (IANA media types) - HTTP | MDN", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "position": ["1", "2", "3"], "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "scrapeId": "d724333b-9de7-4c6e-ac95-e634b69428b0", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/MIME_types", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/MIME_types", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Fundamentals of Performance\"?\n\nAssistant: This document explains what performance is, how the browser platform helps improve it, and what tools and processes you can use to test and improve it.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## What is performance?\nUltimately, user-perceived performance is the only performance that matters. Users provide inputs to the system through touch, movement, and speech. In return, they perceive outputs through sight, touch, and hearing. Performance is the quality of system outputs in response to user inputs.\n\nAll other things being equal, code optimized for some target besides user-perceived performance (hereafter UPP) loses when competing against code optimized for UPP. Users prefer, say, a responsive, smooth app that only processes 1,000 database transactions per second, over a choppy, unresponsive app that processes 100,000,000 per second. Of course, it's by no means pointless to optimize other metrics, but real UPP targets come first.\n\nThe next few subsections point out and discuss essential performance metrics.\n\n## Responsiveness\nResponsiveness means how fast the system provides outputs (possibly multiple ones) in response to user inputs. For example, when a user taps the screen, they expect the pixels to change in a certain way. For this interaction, the responsiveness metric is the time elapsed between the tap and the pixel change.\n\nResponsiveness sometimes involves multiple stages of feedback. Application launch is one particularly important case discussed in more detail below.\n\nResponsiveness is important because people get frustrated and angry when they're ignored. Your app is ignoring the user every second that it fails to respond to the user's input.\n\n## Frame rate\nFrame rate is the rate at which the system changes pixels displayed to the user. This is a familiar concept: everyone prefers, say, games that display 60 frames per second over ones that display 10 frames per second, even if they can't explain why.\n\nFrame rate is important as a \"quality of service\" metric. Computer displays are designed to \"fool\" user's eyes, by delivering photons to them that mimic reality. For example, paper covered with printed text reflects photons to the user's eyes in some pattern. By manipulating pixels, a reader app emits photons in a similar pattern to \"fool\" the user's eyes.\n\nAs your brain infers, motion is not jerky and discrete, but rather \"updates\" smoothly and continuously. (Strobe lights are fun because they turn that upside down, starving your brain of inputs to create the illusion of discrete reality). On a computer display, a higher frame rate makes for a more faithful imitation of reality.\n\n**Note:**\nHumans usually cannot perceive differences in frame rate above 60Hz. That's why most modern electronic displays are designed to refresh at that rate. A television probably looks choppy and unrealistic to a hummingbird, for example.\n\n## Memory usage\n**Memory usage** is another key metric. Unlike responsiveness and frame rate, users don't directly perceive memory usage, but memory usage closely approximates \"user state\". An ideal system would maintain 100% of user state at all times: all applications in the system would run simultaneously, and all applications would retain the state created by the user the last time the user interacted with the application (application state is stored in computer memory, which is why the approximation is close).\n\nFrom this comes an important but counter-intuitive corollary: a well-designed system does not maximize the amount of **free** memory. Memory is a resource, and free memory is an unused resource. Rather, a well-designed system has been optimized to **use** as much memory as possible to maintain user state, while meeting other UPP goals.\n\nThat doesn't mean the system should **waste** memory. When a system uses more memory than necessary to maintain some particular user state, the system is wasting a resource it could use to retain some other user state. In practice, no system can maintain all user states. Intelligently allocating memory to user state is an important concern that we go over in more detail below.\n\n## Power usage\nThe final metric discussed here is **power usage**. Like memory usage, users perceive power usage only indirectly, by how long their devices can maintain all other UPP goals. In service of meeting UPP goals, the system must use only the minimum power required.\n\nThe remainder of this document will discuss performance in terms of these metrics.\n\n## Platform performance optimizations\nThis section provides a brief overview of how Firefox/Gecko contributes to performance generally, below the level of all applications. From a developer's or user's perspective, this answers the question, \"What does the platform do for you?\"\n\n## Web technologies\nThe Web platform provides many tools, some better suited for particular jobs than others. All application logic is written in JavaScript. To display graphics, developers can use HTML or CSS (i.e. high-level declarative languages), or use low-level imperative interfaces offered by the `<canvas>` element (which includes WebGL). Somewhere \"in between\" HTML/CSS and Canvas is SVG, which offers some benefits of both.\n\nHTML and CSS greatly increase productivity, sometimes at the expense of frame rate or pixel-level control over rendering. Text and images reflow automatically, UI elements automatically receive the system theme, and the system provides \"built-in\" support for some use cases developers may not think of initially, like different-resolution displays or right-to-left languages.\n\nThe `canvas` element offers a pixel buffer directly for developers to draw on. This gives developers pixel-level control over rendering and precise control of frame rate, but now the developers need to deal with multiple resolutions and orientations, right-to-left languages, and so forth. Developers draw to canvases using either a familiar 2D drawing API, or WebGL, a \"close to the metal\" binding that mostly follows OpenGL ES 2.0.\n\n## Gecko rendering\nThe Gecko JavaScript engine supports just-in-time (JIT) compilation. This enables application logic to perform comparably to other virtual machines — such as Java virtual machines — and in some cases even close to \"native code\".\n\nThe graphics pipeline in Gecko that underpins HTML, CSS, and Canvas is optimized in several ways. The HTML/CSS layout and graphics code in Gecko reduces invalidation and repainting for common cases like scrolling; developers get this support \"for free\". Pixel buffers painted by both Gecko \"automatically\" and applications to `canvas` \"manually\" minimize copies when being drawn to the display framebuffer. This is done by avoiding intermediate surfaces where they would create overhead (such as per-application \"back buffers\" in many other operating systems), and by using special memory for graphics buffers that can be directly accessed by the compositor hardware. Complex scenes are rendered using the device's GPU for maximum performance. To improve power usage, simple scenes are rendered using special dedicated composition hardware, while the GPU idles or turns off.\n\nFully static content is the exception rather than the rule for rich applications. Rich applications use dynamic content with animation and transition effects. Transitions and animations are particularly important to applications: developers can use CSS to declare complicated behavior with a simple, high-level syntax. In turn, Gecko's graphics pipeline is highly optimized to render common animations efficiently. Common-case animations are \"offloaded\" to the system compositor, which can render them in a performant, power-efficient fashion.\n\nAn app's startup performance matters just as much as its runtime performance. Gecko is optimized to load a wide variety of content efficiently: the entire Web! Many years of improvements targeting this content, like parallel HTML parsing, intelligent scheduling of reflows and image decoding, clever layout algorithms, etc., translate just as well to improving Web applications on Firefox.\n\n## Application performance\nThis section is intended for developers asking the question: \"How can I make my app fast\"?\n\n## Startup performance\nApplication startup is punctuated by three user-perceived events, generally speaking:\n\n- The first is the application **first paint** — the point at which sufficient application resources have been loaded to paint an initial frame\n- The second is when the application becomes **interactive** — for example, users are able to tap a button and the application responds\n- The final event is **full load** — for example when all the user's albums have been listed in a music player\n\nThe key to fast startup is to keep two things in mind: UPP is all that matters, and there's a \"critical path\" to each user-perceived event above. The critical path is exactly and only the code that must run to produce the event.\n\nFor example, to paint an application's first frame that comprises visually some HTML and CSS to style that HTML:\n\n1. The HTML must be parsed\n2. The DOM for that HTML must be constructed\n3. Resources like images in that part of the DOM have to be loaded and decoded\n4. The CSS styles must be applied to that DOM\n5. The styled document has to be reflowed\n\nNowhere in that list is \"load the JS file needed for an uncommon menu\"; \"fetch and decode the image for the High Scores list\", etc. Those work items are not on the critical path to painting the first frame.\n\nIt seems obvious, but to reach a user-perceived startup event more quickly, the main \"trick\" is run _only the code on the critical path._ Shorten the critical path by simplifying the scene.\n\nThe Web platform is highly dynamic. JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language, and the Web platform allows loading code, HTML, CSS, images, and other resources dynamically. These features can be used to defer work that's off the critical path by loading unnecessary content \"lazily\" some time after startup.\n\nAnother problem that can delay startup is idle time, caused by waiting for responses to requests (like database loads). To avoid this problem, applications should issue requests as early as possible in startup (this is called \"front-loading\"). Then when the data is needed later, hopefully it's already available and the application doesn't have to wait.\n\n**Note:**\nFor much more information on improving startup performance, read [Optimizing startup performance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Guides/Optimizing_startup_performance).\n\nOn the same note, notice that locally-cached, static resources can be loaded much faster than dynamic data fetched over high-latency, low-bandwidth mobile networks. Network requests should never be on the critical path to early application startup. Local caching/offline apps can be achieved via [Service Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API). See [Offline and background operation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Guides/Offline_and_background_operation) for a guide about using service workers for offline and background sync capabilities.\n\n## Frame rate\nThe first important thing for high frame rate is to choose the right tool. Use HTML and CSS to implement content that's mostly static, scrolled, and infrequently animated. Use Canvas to implement highly dynamic content, like games that need tight control over rendering and don't need theming.\n\nFor content drawn using Canvas, it's up to the developer to hit frame rate targets: they have direct control over what's drawn.\n\nFor HTML and CSS content, the path to high frame rate is to use the right primitives. Firefox is highly optimized to scroll arbitrary content; this is usually not a concern. But often trading some generality and quality for speed, such as using a static rendering instead of a CSS radial gradient, can push scrolling frame rate over a target. CSS media queries allow these compromises to be restricted only to devices that need them.\n\nMany applications use transitions or animations through \"pages\", or \"panels\". For example, the user taps a \"Settings\" button to transition into an application configuration screen, or a settings menu \"pops up\". Firefox is highly optimized to transition and animate scenes that:\n\n- use pages/panels approximately the size of the device screen or smaller\n- transition/animate the CSS `transform` and `opacity` properties\n\nTransitions and animations that adhere to these guidelines can be offloaded to the system compositor and run maximally efficiently.\n\n## Memory and power usage\nImproving memory and power usage is a similar problem to speeding up startup: don't do unneeded work or lazily load uncommonly-used UI resources. Do use efficient data structures and ensure resources like images are optimized well.\n\nModern CPUs can enter a lower-power mode when mostly idle. Applications that constantly fire timers or keep unnecessary animations running prevent CPUs from entering low-power mode. Power-efficient applications shouldn't do that.\n\nWhen applications are sent to the background, a visibilitychange event is fired on their documents. This event is a developer's friend; applications should listen for it.\n\n## Specific coding tips for application performance\nThe following practical tips will help improve one or more of the Application performance factors discussed above.\n\n## Use CSS animations and transitions\nInstead of using some library's `animate()` function, which probably currently uses many badly performing technologies (setTimeout() or `top`/ `left` positioning, for example) use CSS animations. In many cases, you can actually use CSS Transitions to get the job done. This works well because the browser is designed to optimize these effects and use the GPU to handle them smoothly with minimal impact on processor performance. Another benefit is that you can define these effects in CSS along with the rest of your app's look-and-feel, using a standardized syntax.\n\nCSS animations give you very granular control over your effects using keyframes, and you can even watch events fired during the animation process in order to handle other tasks that need to be performed at set points in the animation process. You can easily trigger these animations with the `:hover`, `:focus`, or `:target`, or by dynamically adding and removing classes on parent elements.\n\nIf you want to create animations on the fly or modify them in JavaScript, James Long has written a simple library for that called [CSS-animations.js](https://github.com/jlongster/css-animations.js/).\n\n## Use CSS transforms\nInstead of tweaking absolute positioning and fiddling with all that math yourself, use the `transform` CSS property to adjust the position, scale, and so forth of your content. Alternatively, you can use the individual transformation properties of `translate`, `scale`, and `rotate`. The reason is, once again, hardware acceleration. The browser can do these tasks on your GPU, letting the CPU handle other things.\n\nIn addition, transforms give you capabilities you might not otherwise have. Not only can you translate elements in 2D space, but you can transform in three dimensions, skew and rotate, and so forth. Paul Irish has an in-depth analysis of the benefits of `translate()` from a performance point of view. In general, however, you have the same benefits you get from using CSS animations: you use the right tool for the job and leave the optimization to the browser. You also use an easily extensible way of positioning elements — something that needs a lot of extra code if you simulate translation with `top` and `left` positioning. Another bonus is that this is just like working in a canvas element.\n\n**Note:**\nYou may need to attach a `translateZ(0.1)` transform if you wish to get hardware acceleration on your CSS animations, depending on platform. As noted above, this can improve performance. When overused, it can have memory consumption issues. What you do in this regard is up to you — do some testing and find out what's best for your particular app.\n\n## Use requestAnimationFrame() instead of setInterval()\nCalls to `setInterval()` run code at a presumed frame rate that may or may not be possible under current circumstances. It tells the browser to render results even while the browser isn't actually drawing; that is, while the video hardware hasn't reached the next display cycle. This wastes processor time and can even lead to reduced battery life on the user's device.\n\nInstead, you should try to use `Window.requestAnimationFrame()`. This waits until the browser is actually ready to start building the next frame of your animation, and won't bother if the hardware isn't going to actually draw anything. Another benefit to this API is that animations won't run while your app isn't visible on the screen (such as if it's in the background and some other task is operating). This will save battery life and prevent users from cursing your name into the night sky.\n\n## Make events immediate\nAs old-school, accessibility-aware Web developers we love click events since they also support keyboard input. On mobile devices, these are too slow. You should use `touchstart` and `touchend` instead. The reason is that these don't have a delay that makes the interaction with the app appear sluggish. If you test for touch support first, you don't sacrifice accessibility, either. For example, the Financial Times uses a library called [fastclick](https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick) for that purpose, which is available for you to use.\n\n## Keep your interface simple\nOne big performance issue we found in HTML apps was that moving lots of DOM elements around makes everything sluggish — especially when they feature lots of gradients and drop shadows. It helps a lot to simplify your look-and-feel and move a proxy element around when you drag and drop.\n\nWhen, for example, you have a long list of elements (let's say tweets), don't move them all. Instead, keep in your DOM tree only the ones that are visible and a few on either side of the currently visible set of tweets. Hide or remove the rest. Keeping the data in a JavaScript object instead of accessing the DOM can vastly improve your app's performance. Think of the display as a presentation of your data rather than the data itself. That doesn't mean you can't use straight HTML as the source; just read it once and then scroll 10 elements, changing the content of the first and last accordingly to your position in the results list, instead of moving 100 elements that aren't visible. The same trick applies in games to sprites: if they aren't currently on the screen, there is no need to poll them. Instead, re-use elements that scroll off-screen as new ones coming in.\n\n## General application performance analysis\nFirefox, Chrome, and other browsers include built-in tools that can help you diagnose slow page rendering. In particular, Firefox's Network Monitor will display a precise timeline of when each network request on your page happens, how large it is, and how long it takes.\n\nIf your page contains JavaScript code that is taking a long time to run, the JavaScript profiler will pinpoint the slowest lines of code.\n\nThe Built-in Gecko Profiler is a very useful tool that provides even more detailed information about which parts of the browser code are running slowly while the profiler runs. This is a bit more complex to use, but provides a lot of useful details.\n\n**Note:**\nYou can use these tools with the Android browser by running Firefox and enabling about:debugging.\n\nIn particular, making dozens or hundreds of network requests takes longer in mobile browsers. Rendering large images and CSS gradients can also take longer. Downloading large files can take longer, even over a fast network, because mobile hardware is sometimes too slow to take advantage of all the available bandwidth. For useful general tips on mobile Web performance, have a look at Maximiliano Firtman's Mobile Web High Performance talk.\n\n## Test cases and submitting bugs\nIf the Firefox and Chrome developer tools don't help you find a problem, or if they seem to indicate that the Web browser has caused the problem, try to provide a reduced test case that maximally isolates the problem. That often helps in diagnosing problems.\n\nSee if you can reproduce the problem by saving and loading a static copy of an HTML page (including any images/stylesheets/scripts it embeds). If so, edit the static files to remove any private information, then send them to others for help (submit a Bugzilla report, for example, or host it on a server and share the URL). You should also share any profiling information you've collected using the tools listed above.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Fundamentals", "title": "Fundamentals of Performance", "description": "This document explains what performance is, how the browser platform helps improve it, and what tools and processes you can use to test and improve it.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 20, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 00:27:54", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "og:type": "website", "title": "Performance fundamentals - Web performance | MDN", "description": "Performance means efficiency.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Web Application Manifest\"?\n\nAssistant: A web application manifest is a JSON text file that provides information about a web application, primarily used for installing progressive web apps (PWAs) on devices.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Members\nThis section lists the members that may appear in the manifest.\n\nAll members are optional in the specification, but some applications require some members to be present. For example, PWAs must provide certain manifest members.\n\n- background_color\n- categories\n- description\n- display\n- display_override (Experimental)\n- file_handlers (Experimental)\n- icons\n- id\n- launch_handler (Experimental)\n- name\n- note_taking (Experimental)\n- orientation\n- prefer_related_applications (Experimental)\n- protocol_handlers (Experimental)\n- related_applications (Experimental)\n- scope\n- screenshots\n- serviceworker (Experimental, Non-standard)\n- share_target (Experimental)\n- short_name\n- shortcuts\n- start_url\n- theme_color\n\n**Note:** The dir, lang, and iarc_rating_id members are not implemented.\n\n## Example manifest\n```json\n{\n  \"short_name\": \"MDN\",\n  \"name\": \"MDN Web Docs\",\n  \"icons\": [\n    {\n      \"src\": \"/favicon-192x192.png\",\n      \"sizes\": \"192x192\",\n      \"type\": \"image/png\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"src\": \"/favicon-512x512.png\",\n      \"sizes\": \"512x512\",\n      \"type\": \"image/png\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"start_url\": \".\",\n  \"display\": \"standalone\",\n  \"theme_color\": \"#000000\",\n  \"background_color\": \"#ffffff\"\n}\n```\n\n## Deploying a manifest\nWeb app manifests are deployed in your HTML pages using a `<link>` element in the `<head>` of a document:\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"manifest\" href=\"manifest.json\" />\n```\n\nThe .webmanifest extension is specified in the Media type registration section of the specification (the response of the manifest file should return `Content-Type: application/manifest+json`). Browsers generally support manifests with other appropriate extensions like .json ( `Content-Type: application/json`).\n\nIf the manifest requires credentials to fetch, the `crossorigin` attribute must be set to `use-credentials`, even if the manifest file is in the same origin as the current page.\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"manifest\" href=\"/app.webmanifest\" crossorigin=\"use-credentials\" />\n```\n\n## Splash screens\nIn some browsers and operating systems, a splash screen is displayed when an installed PWA is launched. This splash screen is automatically generated and its appearance is defined by members in the web app manifest, specifically:\n\n- name\n- background_color\n- icons\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Manifest", "title": "Web Application Manifest", "description": "A web application manifest is a JSON text file that provides information about a web application, primarily used for installing progressive web apps (PWAs) on devices.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 4, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 00:28:31", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"position": ["1", "2", "3"], "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Manifest", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "language": "en-US", "ogTitle": "Web app manifests - Progressive web apps | MDN", "ogLocale": "en_US", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Manifest", "title": "Web app manifests - Progressive web apps | MDN", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "og:description": "A web application manifest, defined in the Web Application Manifest specification, is a JSON text file that provides information about a web application.", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:image:height": "1080", "og:title": "Web app manifests - Progressive web apps | MDN", "description": "A web application manifest, defined in the Web Application Manifest specification, is a JSON text file that provides information about a web application.", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:image:width": "1920", "og:image:type": "image/png", "ogDescription": "A web application manifest, defined in the Web Application Manifest specification, is a JSON text file that provides information about a web application.", "og:type": "website", "og:locale": "en_US", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "scrapeId": "da4bc399-9cce-44ad-bfd8-710100850116", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Manifest", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Manifest", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"DOMPoint\"?\n\nAssistant: A DOMPoint object represents a 2D or 3D point in a coordinate system, including values for coordinates in up to three dimensions and an optional perspective value.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Constructor\n`DOMPoint()` creates and returns a new `DOMPoint` object given the values of zero or more of its coordinate components and optionally the `w` perspective value. You can also use an existing `DOMPoint` or `DOMPointReadOnly` or an object to create a new point by calling the `DOMPoint.fromPoint()` static method.\n\n## Instance properties\n`DOMPoint` may also inherit properties from its parent, `DOMPointReadOnly`.\n\n- `DOMPoint.x`: The `x` coordinate of the `DOMPoint`.\n- `DOMPoint.y`: The `y` coordinate of the `DOMPoint`.\n- `DOMPoint.z`: The `z` coordinate of the `DOMPoint`.\n- `DOMPoint.w`: The perspective value of the `DOMPoint`.\n\n## Instance methods\n`DOMPoint` inherits instance methods from its parent, `DOMPointReadOnly`.\n\n## Static methods\n`DOMPoint` may also inherit static methods from its parent, `DOMPointReadOnly`.\n\n- `DOMPoint.fromPoint()`: Creates a new mutable `DOMPoint` object given an existing point (or an object containing matching properties), which provides the values for its properties.\n\n## Examples\nIn the WebXR Device API, `DOMPointReadOnly` values represent positions and orientations. In the following snippet, the pose of the XR device (such as a VR headset or phone with AR capabilities) can be retrieved by calling using `XRFrame.getViewerPose()` during an `XRSession` animation frame, then accessing the resulting `XRPose`'s `transform` property, which contains two `DOMPointReadOnly` attributes: `position` as a vector and `orientation` as a quaternion.\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [Geometry Interfaces Module Level 1<br># DOMPoint](https://drafts.fxtf.org/geometry/#DOMPoint) |\n\n## Browser compatibility\n\n\n## See also\n- `DOMRect`\n- `DOMMatrix`\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMPoint", "title": "DOMPoint", "description": "A DOMPoint object represents a 2D or 3D point in a coordinate system, including values for coordinates in up to three dimensions and an optional perspective value.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 8, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 00:29:05", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMPoint", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "position": ["1", "2", "3"], "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Learn about the DOMPoint interface, including its constructor, properties, and methods, code examples, specifications, and browser compatibility.", "ogDescription": "A DOMPoint object represents a 2D or 3D point in a coordinate system; it includes values for the coordinates in up to three dimensions, as well as an optional perspective value.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"CSS `<image>` Data Type\"?\n\nAssistant: The `<image>` CSS data type represents a two-dimensional image.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Syntax\nThe `<image>` data type can be represented with any of the following:\n\n- An image denoted by the [`<url>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/url_value) data type\n- A [`<gradient>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient) data type\n- A part of the webpage, defined by the [`element()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/element) function\n- An image, image fragment or solid patch of color, defined by the [`image()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/image/image) function\n- A blending of two or more images defined by the [`cross-fade()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/cross-fade) function.\n- A selection of images chosen based on resolution defined by the [`image-set()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/image/image-set) function.\n- Generated by a [paint worklet](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSS_Painting_API) with the [`paint()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/image/paint) function.\n\n## Description\nCSS can handle the following kinds of images:\n\n- Images with _intrinsic dimensions_ (a natural size), like a JPEG, PNG, or other [raster format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics).\n- Images with _multiple intrinsic dimensions_, existing in multiple versions inside a single file, like some .ico formats. (In this case, the intrinsic dimensions will be those of the image largest in area and the [aspect ratio](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Aspect_ratio) most similar to the containing box.)\n- Images with no intrinsic dimensions but with _an intrinsic aspect ratio_ between its width and height, like an SVG or other [vector format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics).\n- Images with _neither intrinsic dimensions, nor an intrinsic aspect ratio_, like a CSS gradient.\n\nCSS determines an object's _concrete size_ using (1) its _intrinsic dimensions_; (2) its _specified size_, defined by CSS properties like [`width`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/width), [`height`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/height), or [`background-size`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-size); and (3) its _default size_, determined by the kind of property the image is used with:\n\n| Kind of Object (CSS Property) | Default object size |\n| --- | --- |\n| [`background-image`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-image) | The size of the element's background positioning area |\n| [`list-style-image`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/list-style-image) | The size of a `1em` character |\n| [`border-image-source`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-image-source) | The size of the element's border image area |\n| [`cursor`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/cursor) | The browser-defined size matching the usual cursor size on the client's system |\n| [`mask-image`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mask-image) | ? |\n| [`shape-outside`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/shape-outside) | ? |\n| [`mask-border-source`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mask-border-source) | ? |\n| [`symbols()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/symbols) for @counter-style | At risk feature. If supported, the browser-defined size matching the usual cursor size on the client's system |\n| [`content`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/content) for a pseudo-element ( [`::after`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::after)/ [`::before`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::before)) | A 300px × 150px rectangle |\n\nThe concrete object size is calculated using the following algorithm:\n\n- If the specified size defines _both the width and the height_, these values are used as the concrete object size.\n- If the specified size defines _only the width or only the height_, the missing value is determined using the intrinsic ratio, if there is any, the intrinsic dimensions if the specified value matches, or the default object size for that missing value.\n- If the specified size defines _neither the width nor the height_, the concrete object size is calculated so that it matches the intrinsic aspect ratio of the image but without exceeding the default object size in any dimension. If the image has no intrinsic aspect ratio, the intrinsic aspect ratio of the object it applies to is used; if this object has none, the missing width or height are taken from the default object size.\n\n**Note:**\nNot all browsers support every type of image on every property. See the [browser compatibility section](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/image#browser_compatibility) for details.\n\n## Accessibility\nBrowsers do not provide any special information on background images to assistive technology. This is important primarily for screen readers, as a screen reader will not announce its presence and therefore convey nothing to its users.

This includes entries for resource loading, event timing, and more.\n\nA performance entry can also be created by calling the Performance.mark() or Performance.measure() methods at an explicit point in an application. This allows you to add your own metrics to the performance timeline.\n\n## Subclasses of PerformanceEntry\nThe PerformanceEntry instances will always be one of the following subclasses:\n- LargestContentfulPaint\n- LayoutShift\n- PerformanceEventTiming\n- PerformanceLongAnimationFrameTiming\n- PerformanceLongTaskTiming\n- PerformanceMark\n- PerformanceMeasure\n- PerformanceNavigationTiming\n- PerformancePaintTiming\n- PerformanceResourceTiming\n- PerformanceScriptTiming\n- PerformanceServerTiming\n- TaskAttributionTiming\n- VisibilityStateEntry\n\n## Instance properties\n- PerformanceEntry.name: A string representing the name for a performance entry. The value depends on the subtype.\n- PerformanceEntry.entryType: A string representing the type of performance metric. For example, \"mark\" when PerformanceMark is used.\n- PerformanceEntry.startTime: A DOMHighResTimeStamp representing the starting time for the performance metric.\n- PerformanceEntry.duration: A DOMHighResTimeStamp representing the duration of the performance entry.\n\n## Instance methods\n- PerformanceEntry.toJSON(): Returns a JSON representation of the PerformanceEntry object.\n\n## Example\nThe following example creates PerformanceEntry objects that are of the types PerformanceMark and PerformanceMeasure.

These guides explain how to resolve issues surfaced by the HTTP Observatory tests: the tool links to the relevant guide for each issue, helping guide you towards an effective resolution. Interestingly, Mozilla's internal developer teams use this guidance when implementing websites to ensure that security best practices are applied.\n\nThe guides in the table below are listed in the order that we recommend implementing the security features they describe. This order is based on a combination of each feature's security impact and the ease of its implementation from both operational and developmental perspectives. The table provides information about each feature's impact, difficulty of implementation, whether or not it is required, and a brief description.\n\n| Guide | Impact | Difficulty | Required | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| [TLS configuration](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Practical_implementation_guides/TLS#tls_configuration) | Medium | Medium | Yes | Use the most secure [Transport Layer Security](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/TLS) (TLS) configuration available for your user base. |\n| TLS: [Resource loading](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Practical_implementation_guides/TLS#resource_loading) | Maximum | Low | Yes | Load both passive and active resources via HTTPS. |\n| TLS: [HTTP redirection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Practical_implementation_guides/TLS#http_redirection) | Maximum | Low | Yes | Websites must redirect to HTTPS; API endpoints should disable HTTP entirely. |\n| TLS: [HSTS implementation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Practical_implementation_guides/TLS#http_strict_transport_security_implementation) | High | Low | Yes | Notify user agents to connect to sites only over HTTPS, even if the original scheme chosen was HTTP, by using HTTP Strict transport security (HSTS). |\n| [Clickjacking prevention](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Practical_implementation_guides/Clickjacking) | High | Low | Yes | Control how your site may be framed within an [`<iframe>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe) to prevent [clickjacking](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/Clickjacking). |\n| [CSRF prevention](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Practical_implementation_guides/CSRF_prevention) | High | Unknown | Varies | Protect against [Cross-site request forgery](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSRF) (CSRF) using `SameSite` cookies and anti-CSRF tokens. |\n| [Secure cookie configuration](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Practical_implementation_guides/Cookies) | High | Medium | Yes | Set all cookies as restrictively as possible. |\n| [CORP implementation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Practical_implementation_guides/CORP) | High | Medium | Yes | Protect against speculative side-channel attacks by using Cross-Origin Resource Policy (CORP). |\n| [MIME type verification](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Practical_implementation_guides/MIME_types) | Low | Low | No | Verify that all your websites are setting the proper [MIME types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/MIME_type) for all resources. |\n| [CSP implementation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Practical_implementation_guides/CSP) | High | High | Yes | Provide fine-grained control over the code that can be loaded on a site and what it is allowed to do with a [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSP) (CSP), thereby mitigating Cross-site scripting ( [XSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Cross-site_scripting)) vulnerabilities. |\n| [CORS configuration](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Practical_implementation_guides/CORS) | High | Low | Yes | Define the non-same origins that are allowed to access the content of pages and have resources loaded from them by using [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CORS) (CORS). |\n| [Referrer policy configuration](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Practical_implementation_guides/Referrer_policy) | Low | Low | Yes | Improve privacy for users and prevent leaking of internal URLs via the [`Referer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referer) header. |\n| [robots.txt configuration](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Practical_implementation_guides/Robots_txt) | Low | Low | No | Tell robots (such as search engine indexers) how to behave by instructing them not to crawl certain paths on the website. |\n| [SRI implementation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Practical_implementation_guides/SRI) | Low | Low | No | Verify that fetched resources (for example, from a CDN) are delivered without unexpected manipulation by using [Subresource Integrity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SRI) (SRI). |\n\n## User information security\n[How to turn off form autocompletion](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Practical_implementation_guides/Turning_off_form_autocompletion)\n\nForm fields support autocompletion; that is, their values can be remembered and automatically filled out next time a user visits your site.

The parameter is an absolute URL, a relative URL, a blob URL, or a data URL. The `url()` function can be passed as a parameter of another CSS function, like the `attr()` function. Depending on the property for which it is a value, the resource sought can be an image, font, or a stylesheet. The `url()` functional notation is the value for the `<url>` data type.\n\n## Difference between URI and URL\nThere is a difference between a URI and a URL. A URI identifies a resource. A URL is a type of URI, and describes the location of a resource. A URI can be either a URL or a name (URN) of a resource.\n\n## CSS Levels\nIn CSS Level 1, the `url()` functional notation described only true URLs. In CSS Level 2, the definition of `url()` was extended to describe any URI, whether a URL or a URN. Confusingly, this meant that `url()` could be used to create a `<uri>` CSS data type. This change was not only awkward but, debatably, unnecessary, since URNs are almost never used in actual CSS. To alleviate the confusion, CSS Level 3 returned to the narrower, initial definition. Now, `url()` denotes only true `<url>`s.\n\n## Basic Usage\nRelative URLs, if used, are relative to the URL of the stylesheet (not to the URL of the web page). The `url()` function can be included as a value for various CSS properties.\n\n## Syntax\nThe syntax for the `url()` function is as follows: <url()> = url( <string> <url-modifier>* ) | <url-token>.\n\n## Examples\nExamples of using the `url()` function in CSS include setting background images, list styles, and content properties.\n\n## Specifications\nThe specification for the `url()` function is defined in the CSS Values and Units Module Level 4.\n\n## Browser Compatibility\nThe `url()` function is supported in all major browsers.\n\n## See Also\nRelated functions and properties include `<gradient>`, `element()`, `image()`, `image-set()`, and `cross-fade()`.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/url_function", "title": "CSS url() Function", "description": "The `url()` CSS function is used to include a file, which can be an absolute URL, a relative URL, a blob URL, or a data URL.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 9, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 00:30:51", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "ogTitle": "url() - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets | MDN", "og:title": "url() - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets | MDN", "title": "url() - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets | MDN", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/url_function", "og:locale": "en_US", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:image:height": "1080", "position": ["1", "2", "3"], "ogDescription": "The url() CSS function is used to include a file.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Permissions API\"?\n\nAssistant: The Permissions API provides a consistent programmatic way to query the status of API permissions attributed to the current context, such as a web page or worker.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Concepts and usage\nHistorically different APIs handle their own permissions inconsistently — for example the Notifications API provided its own methods for requesting permissions and checking permission status, whereas the Geolocation API did not. The Permissions API provides the tools to allow developers to implement a consistent user experience for working with permissions.\n\nThe permissions from this API effectively aggregate all security restrictions for the context, including any requirement for an API to be used in a secure context, Permissions-Policy restrictions applied to the document, requirements for user interaction, and user prompts. So, for example, if an API is restricted by permissions policy, the returned permission would be denied and the user would not be prompted for access.\n\nThe permissions property has been made available on the Navigator object, both in the standard browsing context and the worker context (WorkerNavigator — so permission checks are available inside workers), and returns a Permissions object that provides access to the Permissions API functionality.\n\nOnce you have this object you can then use the Permissions.query() method to return a promise that resolves with the PermissionStatus for a specific API.\n\n## Requesting permission\nIf the permission status is prompt, the user must acknowledge a prompt to grant access to the feature.\n\nThe mechanism that triggers this prompt will depend on the specific API — it is not defined as part of the Permissions API. Generally the trigger is code calling a method to access or open the feature, or that registers for notifications from the feature that will subsequently access it.\n\nNote that not all features require a prompt. Permission might be granted by a Permission Policy, implicitly by transient activation, or via some other mechanism.\n\n## Revoking permission\nPermission revocation is not managed by the API. More specifically, a Permissions.revoke() method was proposed, but has since been removed from those browsers where it was implemented.\n\nUsers can manually remove permission for particular sites using browser settings:\n\n- Firefox: Hamburger Menu > Settings > Privacy & Security > Permissions (then select the Settings button for the permission of interest).\n- Chrome: Hamburger Menu > Settings > Show advanced settings. In the Privacy section, click Content Settings. In the resulting dialog, find the Location section and select Ask when a site tries to…. Finally, click Manage Exceptions and remove the permissions you granted to the sites you are interested in.\n\n## Permission-aware APIs\nNot all APIs' permission statuses can be queried using the Permissions API. A non-exhaustive list of permission-aware APIs includes:\n\n- Background Synchronization API: background-sync (should always be granted)\n- Clipboard_API: clipboard-read, clipboard-write\n- Compute Pressure API: compute-pressure\n- Geolocation API: geolocation\n- Local Font Access API: local-fonts\n- Media Capture and Streams API: microphone, camera\n- Notifications API: notifications\n- Payment Handler API: payment-handler\n- Push API: push\n- Screen Wake Lock API: screen-wake-lock\n- Sensor APIs: accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, ambient-light-sensor\n- Storage Access API: storage-access, top-level-storage-access\n- Storage API: persistent-storage\n- Web Bluetooth API: bluetooth\n- Web MIDI API: midi\n- Window Management API: window-management.\n\n## Interfaces\nPermissions\n\nProvides the core Permission API functionality, such as methods for querying and revoking permissions.\n\nPermissionStatus\n\nProvides access to the current status of a permission, and an event handler to respond to changes in permission status.\n\n## Extensions to other interfaces\nNavigator.permissions and WorkerNavigator.permissions Read only\n\nProvides access to the Permissions object from the main context and worker context respectively.\n\n## Examples\nWe have created an example called Location Finder. You can run the example live, view the source code on GitHub, or read more about how it works in our article Using the Permissions API.\n\nThe Permissions.query() example also shows code that tests most permissions on the current browser and logs the result.\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [Permissions](https://w3c.github.io/permissions/) |\n\n## Browser compatibility\n|  | desktop | mobile |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Chrome | Edge | Firefox | Opera | Safari | Chrome Android | Firefox for Android | Opera Android | Safari on iOS | Samsung Internet | WebView Android | WebView on iOS |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Permissions | Chrome – Full support<br>Chrome43<br>Toggle history | Edge – Full support<br>Edge79<br>Toggle history | Firefox – Full support<br>Firefox46<br>Toggle history | Opera – Full support<br>Opera30<br>Toggle history | Safari – Full support<br>Safari16<br>Toggle history | Chrome Android – Full support<br>Chrome Android43<br>Toggle history | Firefox for Android – Full support<br>Firefox for Android46<br>Toggle history | Opera Android – Full support<br>Opera Android30<br>Toggle history | Safari on iOS – Full support<br>Safari on iOS16<br>Toggle history | Samsung Internet – Full support<br>Samsung Internet4.0<br>Toggle history | WebView Android – No support<br>WebView AndroidNo<br>footnote<br>Toggle history | WebView on iOS – Full support<br>WebView on iOS16<br>Toggle history |\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Permissions_API", "title": "Permissions API", "description": "The Permissions API provides a consistent programmatic way to query the status of API permissions attributed to the current context, such as a web page or worker.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 9, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 00:31:10", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "title": "Permissions API - Web APIs | MDN", "description": "The Permissions API provides a consistent programmatic way to query the status of API permissions attributed to the current context, such as a web page or worker.\nFor example, it can be used to determine if permission to access a particular feature or API has been granted, denied, or requires specific user permission.", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "og:description": "The Permissions API provides a consistent programmatic way to query the status of API permissions attributed to the current context, such as a web page or worker.\nFor example, it can be used to determine if permission to access a particular feature or API has been granted, denied, or requires specific user permission.", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:title": "Permissions API - Web APIs | MDN", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "og:image:type": "image/png", "ogTitle": "Permissions API - Web APIs | MDN", "ogLocale": "en_US", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "language": "en-US", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Permissions_API", "og:type": "website", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Permissions_API", "og:locale": "en_US", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "position": ["1", "2", "3"], "og:image:height": "1080", "og:image:width": "1920", "ogDescription": "The Permissions API provides a consistent programmatic way to query the status of API permissions attributed to the current context, such as a web page or worker.\nFor example, it can be used to determine if permission to access a particular feature or API has been granted, denied, or requires specific user permission.", "scrapeId": "c7abfeff-c7a1-4cbc-ab99-7d19a4209d40", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Permissions_API", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Permissions_API", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"abs() - CSS | MDN\"?\n\nAssistant: The abs() CSS function returns the absolute value of the argument, as the same type as the input.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Syntax\n```css\n/* property: abs(expression) */\nwidth: abs(20% - 100px);\n```\n\n## Parameters\nThe `abs(x)` function accepts only one value as its parameter.\n\n`x`\nA calculation which resolves to a number.\n\n## Return value\nThe absolute value of `x`.\n- if `x`'s numeric value is positive or `0⁺`, return `x`.\n- Otherwise, returns `-1 * x`.\n\n## Formal syntax\n```\n<abs()> =\n  abs( <calc-sum> )\n\n<calc-sum> =\n  <calc-product> [ [ '+' | '-' ] <calc-product> ]*\n\n<calc-product> =\n  <calc-value> [ [ '*' | '/' ] <calc-value> ]*\n\n<calc-value> =\n  <number>        |\n  <dimension>     |\n  <percentage>    |\n  <calc-keyword>  |\n  ( <calc-sum> )\n\n<calc-keyword> =\n  e          |\n  pi         |\n  infinity   |\n  -infinity  |\n  NaN\n```\n\n## Examples\n### Positive variables\nThe `abs()` function can be used to ensure that a value is always positive. In the following example a CSS custom property `--font-size` is used as the value of [`font-size`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-size). Wrapping this custom property in `abs()` will convert a negative value to a positive one.\n\n```css\nh1 {\n  font-size: abs(var(--font-size));\n}\n```\n\n### Control gradient angle of direction\nYou can also control the gradient direction using `abs()` function. In the following example, with an angle of -45deg the gradient would start red and transition to blue. By using `abs()` to make the value positive, the gradient will start blue and transition to red.\n\n```css\ndiv {\n  --deg: -45deg;\n  background-image: linear-gradient(abs(var(--deg)), blue, red);\n}\n```\n\n### Backwards compatible fallback\nIn older browsers that lack the support for CSS `abs()` function, you can use the CSS [`max()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/max) function to achieve the same result, as shown below:\n\n```css\np {\n  line-height: max(var(--lh), -1 * var(--lh));\n}\n```\nWe use the [`max()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/max) function to return the largest (most positive) value from a list of two values: `var(--lh)` or `-1 * var(--lh)`. Irrespective of whether `--lh` is positive or negative, the calculated return value will always be positive, that is, an absolute number.\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [CSS Values and Units Module Level 4\\<br>\\# sign-funcs](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values/#sign-funcs) |\n\n## Browser compatibility\n\n\n## See also\n- [`sign()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/sign)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/abs", "title": "abs() - CSS | MDN", "description": "The abs() CSS function returns the absolute value of the argument, as the same type as the input.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 8, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 00:31:38", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"ogTitle": "abs() - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets | MDN", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "og:image:width": "1920", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "og:title": "abs() - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets | MDN", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/abs", "title": "abs() - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets | MDN", "og:description": "The abs() CSS function returns the absolute value of the argument, as the same type as the input.", "og:image:type": "image/png", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/abs", "og:image:height": "1080", "language": "en-US", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "description": "The abs() CSS function returns the absolute value of the argument, as the same type as the input.", "og:type": "website", "og:locale": "en_US", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "position": ["1", "2", "3"], "ogDescription": "The abs() CSS function returns the absolute value of the argument, as the same type as the input.", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "ogLocale": "en_US", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "scrapeId": "cce6a5e2-b7ab-436b-8f2e-6cd4ed2f83de", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/abs", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/abs", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"WebDriver Timeouts\"?\n\nAssistant: This page covers the various timeout definitions associated with a WebDriver session, including script injection, document navigation, and element retrieval.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Overview\nAssociated with a WebDriver session are various timeout definitions that control behavior for script injection, document navigation, and element retrieval. You will find the timeouts object used in a few different contexts. It can be used as configuration when creating a new session through capabilities, it is returned as part of the matched, effective capabilities after the session has been created, and it is used as input and output for the Set Timeouts and Get Timeouts commands. The default values can be overridden when creating the session and they will be effective until the session is closed. If you call Set Timeouts during the session's lifetime, the defaults are overridden and will take effect for the lifetime of the session or until Set Timeouts is called again.\n\n## Payload\nThe timeouts object is a JSON Object that either describes the current session's timeout values, or which is used as input when configuring the timeouts:\n\n- implicit: Time in milliseconds to retry the element location strategy when finding an element. This defaults to 0, meaning the strategy is run only once.\n- pageLoad: Time in milliseconds to wait for the document to finish loading. By default WebDriver will wait five minutes (or 300,000 ms).\n- script: Scripts injected with Execute Script or Execute Async Script will run until they hit the script timeout duration, which is also given in milliseconds. The scripts will then be interrupted and a script timeout error will be returned. Defaults to 30 seconds (or 30,000 ms).\n\nWhen the object is used as input for the Set Timeouts command or as part of the timeouts capability when creating a new session, all fields are optional. This means you can configure zero or more of the timeout duration values individually or all at once. When it is returned by the driver, either by Get Timeouts or in the matched capabilities from having created a session, all fields will be present.\n\n## Examples\n### Setting timeouts at session creation\nYou can override the default session timeouts by providing a timeouts capabilities object when you start a new WebDriver session:\n\n```python\nimport urllib\n\nfrom selenium import webdriver\n\ndef inline(doc):\n    return \"data:text/html;charset=utf-8,{}\".format(urllib.quote(doc))\n\nsession = webdriver.Firefox(capabilities={\"timeouts\": {\"implicit\": 4500}})\nsession.get(inline(\"\"\"\n    <h1>Example</h1>\n\n    <script>\n      // Inserts <p> below <h1> after 2.5 seconds:\n      setTimeout(() => {\n        const delayedElement = document.createElement(\"p\");\n        const h1 = document.querySelector(\"h1\");\n        document.body.insertAfter(delayedElement, h1);\n      }, 2500);\n    </script>\n    \"\"\"))\n\n# This will cause the driver to wait 4.5 seconds\n# for #foo to appear in the DOM:\ndelayed_element = session.find_element_by_tag_name(\"p\")\n```\n\n### Setting and getting timeouts at runtime\nTimeouts can also be set at runtime using the Set Timeouts command. These will override the session's current timeouts and will take effect for the entire lifetime of the session or until a subsequent call is made to the same command:\n\n```python\nfrom selenium import webdriver\n\nsession = webdriver.Firefox()\n\nsession.set_timeouts({\"implicit\": 4.5})\nprint(session.get_timeouts)\n```\n\nThe output will be in seconds because this is the idiomatic time unit in Python:\n\n```json\n{ \"implicit\": 4.5, \"script\": 300, \"pageLoad\": 30000 }\n```\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/WebDriver/Timeouts", "title": "WebDriver Timeouts", "description": "This page covers the various timeout definitions associated with a WebDriver session, including script injection, document navigation, and element retrieval.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 3, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 00:35:14", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:description": "Associated with a WebDriver session are various timeout definitions that control behavior for script injection, document navigation, and element retrieval.", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "og:image:height": "1080", "ogTitle": "Timeouts - WebDriver | MDN", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:image:type": "image/png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "og:type": "website", "og:image:width": "1920", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/WebDriver/Timeouts", "title": "Timeouts - WebDriver | MDN", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/WebDriver/Timeouts", "ogLocale": "en_US", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "position": ["1", "2", "3"], "language": "en-US", "og:locale": "en_US", "og:title": "Timeouts - WebDriver | MDN", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "ogDescription": "Associated with a WebDriver session are various timeout definitions that control behavior for script injection, document navigation, and element retrieval.", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "description": "Associated with a WebDriver session are various timeout definitions that control behavior for script injection, document navigation, and element retrieval.", "scrapeId": "b612917d-d007-4791-997f-963c04c3b810", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/WebDriver/Timeouts", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/WebDriver/Timeouts", "statusCode": 200}}}

It specifies whether crawlers are allowed or disallowed from accessing an entire website or to certain resources on a website. A restrictive robots.txt file can prevent bandwidth consumption by crawlers.\n\n## Usage\nA site owner can forbid crawlers to detect a certain path (and all files in that path) or a specific file. This is often done to prevent these resources from being indexed or served by search engines.\n\n## Indexing Rules\nIf a crawler is allowed to access resources, you can define indexing rules for those resources via <meta name=\"robots\"> elements and X-Robots-Tag HTTP headers.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Styling Basics\"?\n\nAssistant: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features. This module provides all the CSS fundamentals you'll need for now, including syntax, features, and techniques.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Prerequisites\nBefore starting this module, you should have a basic work environment set up (as detailed in [Installing basic software](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Environment_setup/Installing_software)), and understand how to create and manage files (as detailed in [Dealing with files](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Environment_setup/Dealing_with_files)). You should also be familiar with HTML (work through our [Structuring content with HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content) module if not).\n\n**Note:**\nIf you are working on a computer/tablet/other device where you don't have the ability to create your own files, you could try out (most of) the code examples in an online coding program such as [JSBin](https://jsbin.com/) or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/).\n\n## Tutorials and challenges\n[What is CSS?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/What_is_CSS)\n\nCSS allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS, what the basic syntax looks like, and how your browser applies CSS to HTML to style it.\n\n[Getting started with CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Getting_started)\n\nIn this article, we will take a simple HTML document and apply CSS to it, learning some practical details of the language along the way. We will also review the CSS syntax features you've not looked at yet.\n\n[Styling a biography page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Styling_a_bio_page) Challenge\n\nIn this challenge you will style a simple bio page, testing you on some of the skills you learned in the last couple of lessons including writing selectors and text styling.\n\n[Basic CSS selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Basic_selectors)\n\nIn this article we'll recap some selector fundamentals, including the basic type, class, and ID selectors.\n\n[Attribute selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Attribute_selectors)\n\nAs you know from your study of HTML, elements can have attributes that give further detail about the element being marked up. In CSS you can use attribute selectors to target elements with certain attributes. This lesson will show you how to use these very useful selectors.\n\n[Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Pseudo_classes_and_elements)\n\nThe next set of selectors we will look at are referred to as **pseudo-classes** and **pseudo-elements**. There are a large number of these, and they often serve quite specific purposes. Once you know how to use them, you can look through the different types to see if there is something which works for the task you are trying to achieve.\n\n[Combinators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Combinators)\n\nThe final selectors we will look at are called combinators. Combinators are used to combine other selectors in a way that allows us to select elements based on their location in the DOM relative to other elements (for example, child or sibling).\n\n[The box model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Box_model)\n\nEverything in CSS has a box around it, and understanding these boxes is key to being able to create more complex layouts with CSS, or to align items with other items. In this lesson, we will take a look at the CSS _Box model_. You'll get an understanding of how it works and the terminology that relates to it.\n\n[Handling conflicts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Handling_conflicts)\n\nThe aim of this lesson is to develop your understanding of some of the most fundamental concepts of CSS — the cascade, specificity, and inheritance — which control how CSS is applied to HTML and how conflicts between style declarations are resolved.\n\n[Values and units](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Values_and_units)\n\nCSS rules contain [declarations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_syntax/Syntax#css_declarations), which in turn are composed of properties and values. Each property used in CSS has a **value type** that describes what kind of values it is allowed to have. In this lesson, we will take a look at some of the most frequently used value types, what they are, and how they work.\n\n[Sizing items in CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Sizing)\n\nUnderstanding how big the different features in your design will be is important. In this lesson we will summarize the various ways elements get a size via CSS and define a few terms about sizing that will help you in the future.\n\n[Backgrounds and borders](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Backgrounds_and_borders)\n\nIn this lesson, we will take a look at some of the creative things you can do with CSS backgrounds and borders. From adding gradients, background images, and rounded corners, backgrounds and borders are the answer to a lot of styling questions in CSS.\n\n[Overflowing content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Overflow)\n\nOverflow is what happens when there is too much content to fit inside an element box. In this lesson, you will learn how to manage overflow using CSS.\n\n[Images, media, and form elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Images_media_forms)\n\nIn this lesson we will take a look at how certain special elements are treated in CSS. Images, other media, and form elements behave a little differently from regular boxes in terms of your ability to style them with CSS. Understanding what is and isn't possible can save some frustration, and this lesson will highlight some of the main things that you need to know.\n\n[Styling tables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Tables)\n\nStyling an HTML table isn't the most glamorous job in the world, but sometimes we all have to do it. This article explains how to make HTML tables look good, with some specific table styling techniques highlighted.\n\n[Debugging CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Debugging_CSS)\n\nThis article will give you guidance on how to go about debugging a CSS problem, and show you how the DevTools included in all modern browsers can help you to find out what is going on.\n\n[Challenge: Fundamental CSS comprehension](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Fundamental_CSS_comprehension) Challenge\n\nThis challenge provides a number of related exercises that must be completed in order to create the final design — a business card/gamer card/social media profile.\n\n[Challenge: Creating fancy letterheaded paper](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Fancy_letterheaded_paper) Challenge\n\nIf you want to make the right impression, writing a letter on nice letterheaded paper can be a really good start. In this challenge you will create an online template to achieve such a look.\n\n[Challenge: A cool-looking box](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Cool-looking_box) Challenge\n\nIn this challenge, you'll get some more practice in creating cool-looking boxes by trying to create an eye-catching box.\n\n## Additional tutorials\nThese tutorials are not part of the learning pathway, but they are interesting nonetheless — you should consider these as stretch goals, to optionally study when you are done with the main Core articles.\n\n[Advanced styling effects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Advanced_styling_effects)\n\nThis article will give you guidance on how to go about debugging a CSS problem, and show you how the DevTools included in all modern browsers can help you to find out what is going on.\n\n[Cascade layers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Cascade_layers)\n\nThis lesson aims to introduce you to [cascade layers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@layer), a more advanced feature that builds on the fundamental concepts of the [CSS cascade](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/Cascade) and [CSS specificity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/Specificity).\n\n[Handling different text directions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Handling_different_text_directions)\n\nIn recent years, CSS has evolved in order to better support different directionality of content, including right-to-left but also top-to-bottom content (such as Japanese) — these different directionalities are called writing modes.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"GPUQuerySet\"?\n\nAssistant: The GPUQuerySet interface of the WebGPU API is used to record the results of queries on passes, such as occlusion or timestamp queries.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Overview\nThe GPUQuerySet interface of the WebGPU API is used to record the results of queries on passes, such as occlusion or timestamp queries.\n\n- Occlusion queries are available on render passes to query whether any fragment samples pass all the per-fragment tests for a set of drawing commands (including scissor, sample mask, alpha to coverage, stencil, and depth tests). To run an occlusion query, an appropriate GPUQuerySet must be provided as the value of the occlusionQuerySet descriptor property when invoking GPUCommandEncoder.beginRenderPass() to run a render pass.\n\n- Timestamp queries allow applications to write timestamps to a GPUQuerySet. To run a timestamp query, appropriate GPUQuerySet s must be provided inside the value of the timestampWrites descriptor property when invoking GPUCommandEncoder.beginRenderPass() to run a render pass, or GPUCommandEncoder.beginComputePass() to run a compute pass.\n\n## Instance properties\n- [`count`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GPUQuerySet/count \"count\") Experimental Read only: A number specifying the number of queries managed by the GPUQuerySet.\n- [`label`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GPUQuerySet/label \"label\") Experimental: A string providing a label that can be used to identify the object, for example in [`GPUError`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GPUError) messages or console warnings.\n- [`type`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GPUQuerySet/type \"type\") Experimental Read only: An enumerated value specifying the type of queries managed by the GPUQuerySet.\n\n## Instance methods\n- [`destroy()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GPUQuerySet/destroy \"destroy()\") Experimental: Destroys the GPUQuerySet.\n\n## Examples\nThe following snippet creates a GPUQuerySet that holds 32 occlusion query results, and then returns the type and count:\n\n```javascript\nconst querySet = device.createQuerySet({\n  type: \"occlusion\",\n  count: 32,\n});\n\nconsole.log(querySet.count); // 32\nconsole.log(querySet.type); // \"occlusion\"\n```\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [WebGPU<br>#

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Protocol upgrade mechanism\"?\n\nAssistant: This page covers the HTTP/1.1 protocol's mechanism for upgrading an established connection to a different protocol using the Upgrade header field.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Upgrading HTTP/1.1 Connections\nThe `Upgrade` header field is used by clients to invite the server to switch to one of the listed protocols, in descending preference order.\n\nBecause `Upgrade` is a hop-by-hop header, it also needs to be listed in the `Connection` header field. This means that a typical request that includes Upgrade would look something like:\n\n```\nGET /index.html HTTP/1.1\n\n```\n\nOther headers may be required depending on the requested protocol; for example, WebSocket upgrades allow additional headers to configure details about the WebSocket connection as well as to offer a degree of security in opening the connection. See Upgrading to a WebSocket connection for more details.\n\nIf the server decides to upgrade the connection, it sends back a `101 Switching Protocols` response status with an Upgrade header that specifies the protocol(s) being switched to. If it does not (or cannot) upgrade the connection, it ignores the `Upgrade` header and sends back a regular response (for example, a `200 OK`).\n\nRight after sending the `101` status code, the server can begin speaking the new protocol, performing any additional protocol-specific handshakes as necessary. Effectively, the connection becomes a two-way pipe as soon as the upgraded response is complete, and the request that initiated the upgrade can be completed over the new protocol.\n\n## Common uses for this mechanism\nHere we look at the most common use cases for the `Upgrade` header.\n\n## Upgrading to a WebSocket connection\nBy far, the most common use case for upgrading an HTTP connection is to use WebSockets, which are always implemented by upgrading an HTTP or HTTPS connection. Keep in mind that if you're opening a new connection using the WebSocket API, or any library that does WebSockets, most or all of this is done for you. For example, opening a WebSocket connection is as simple as:\n\n```\nwebSocket = new WebSocket(\"ws://destination.server.ext\", \"optionalProtocol\");\n```\n\nThe `WebSocket()` constructor does all the work of creating an initial HTTP/1.1 connection then handling the handshaking and upgrade process for you.\n\n**Note:**\nYou can also use the \"wss://\" URL scheme to open a secure WebSocket connection.\n\nIf you need to create a WebSocket connection from scratch, you'll have to handle the handshaking process yourself. After creating the initial HTTP/1.1 session, you need to request the upgrade by adding to a standard request the `Upgrade` and `Connection` headers.\n\n## WebSocket-specific headers\nThe following headers are involved in the WebSocket upgrade process. Other than the `Upgrade` and `Connection` headers, the rest are generally optional or handled for you by the browser and server when they're talking to each other.\n\n## Response-only headers\nThe response from the server may include these.\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [The WebSocket Protocol](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455) |\n| [Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7230) |\n| [Hypertext Transfer Protocol Version 2 (HTTP/2)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540) |\n\n## See also\n- [WebSocket API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket)\n- [Evolution of HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Evolution_of_HTTP)\n- Glossary terms:\n  - [HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP)\n  - [HTTP/2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP_2)\n  - [QUIC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/QUIC)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Protocol_upgrade_mechanism", "title": "Protocol upgrade mechanism", "description": "This page covers the HTTP/1.1 protocol's mechanism for upgrading an established connection to a different protocol using the Upgrade header field.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 7, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 00:37:12", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"ogDescription": "The HTTP/1.1 protocol provides a special mechanism that can be used to upgrade an already established connection to a different protocol, using the Upgrade header field.", "title": "Protocol upgrade mechanism - HTTP | MDN", "og:locale": "en_US", "og:image:width": "1920", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "ogLocale": "en_US", "description": "The HTTP/1.1 protocol provides a special mechanism that can be used to upgrade an already established connection to a different protocol, using the Upgrade header field.", "og:type": "website", "ogTitle": "Protocol upgrade mechanism - HTTP | MDN", "og:description": "The HTTP/1.1 protocol provides a special mechanism that can be used to upgrade an already established connection to a different protocol, using the Upgrade header field.", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Protocol_upgrade_mechanism", "og:title": "Protocol upgrade mechanism - HTTP | MDN", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Protocol_upgrade_mechanism", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "language": "en-US", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "position": ["1", "2", "3"], "og:image:height": "1080", "og:image:type": "image/png", "scrapeId": "93810d8d-f3df-4b47-a599-7676b44f8ac1", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Protocol_upgrade_mechanism", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Protocol_upgrade_mechanism", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Game distribution\"?\n\nAssistant: This article covers all you need to know about the ways in which you can distribute your newly created game into the wild. This includes hosting it yourself online, submitting it to open marketplaces, and submitting it to closed ones like Google Play or the iOS App Store.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Benefits of HTML over native\nBuilding games with HTML gives you extra advantages, such as:\n\n### Multiplatform bliss\nThe technology itself is multiplatform, so you can write the code once and target multiple devices. This can range from low-end smartphones or tablets, through laptops and desktop computers, to smart TVs, watches or even a fridge if it can handle a modern enough browser.\n\nYou don't need to have separate teams to work on the same title targeting different platforms with only one code base to worry about. You can spend more time and money on Promotion and Monetization.\n\n### Instant updates\nYou don't have to wait several days to have your game's code updated. If your user finds a bug, you can quickly fix it, update the system and refresh the game on your server to provide players with the updated code almost instantly.\n\n### Direct link distribution and instant play\nYou don't have to tell people to search for your game in an app store with HTML games. You can just send them a direct URL to access the game, which they can then click to play the game right away without the need to use third party plugins or download and install a large package. Bear in mind that downloading the game might still take a bit of time depending on the size of the game and your network speed. In any case, it's a lot easier to promote the game if you can drive traffic directly where you want it and don't have to jump through lots of hoops to play.\n\n## Desktop vs. mobile\nThe vast majority of the traffic we are interested in — people playing HTML games — comes from mobile devices so that's something you will have to focus on if you truly want to succeed. Mobile devices are where HTML technology can truly shine and show its advantages. There's no Flash, and HTML is fully multiplatform.\n\nTrying to compete with desktop games directly is very difficult. You can put your HTML games into the same arena (see Native desktop, later on) and you should because it's good to diversify the platforms you support, but you have to remember that developers creating desktop games have years of experience, great tools and stable distribution channels. Many HTML games will target different market segments than native desktop games, e.g. simple time killer games to be played while on the move rather than huge immersive experiences. Such games are often designed to be played with two, or even one finger, so you can hold the device, play the game and be able to use the second hand for whatever you currently need.\n\nSaying this, desktop platforms can be used for distribution quite easily with the availability of wrappers that can help you prepare native builds of your game see Packaging games. It's also nice to provide desktop controls for your games even if you're mostly targeting mobile. Players are enjoying your games on any platform available, and desktop is one of them. Plus, it is usually easier to build and test the game first on desktop, and then move on to debugging mobile.\n\n## Publishing the game\nThere are three main options when it comes to publishing a game:\n\n- Self-hosting\n- Publishers\n- Stores\n\nRemember that the name of your game should be unique enough to be quickly promoted later on, but also catchy enough, so people don't forget it.\n\n## Self-hosting\nIf you are a front-end developer, you may already know what to do. An HTML game is just another website. You can upload it to a remote server, grab a catchy domain name, and host it yourself.\n\nIf you want to make money out of game dev, you should secure your source code one way or another against people who could easily take it and sell it as their own. You can concatenate and minify the code to make it smaller and uglify it so it's a lot harder to reverse engineer your game. Another good measure to take is to provide an online demo if you're planning on packaging it and selling it in a closed store like iTunes or Steam.\n\nIf you're working on a side project just for fun, then leaving the source open will benefit those who would like to learn from what you've created. You don't even have to worry about looking for a hosting provider as it's possible to host games on GitHub Pages. You'll get free hosting, version control and possible contributors if your project is interesting enough.\n\n## Publishers and portals\nAs the name may suggest, publishers can handle the publishing of your game for you. Whether you should go that way or not depends on what your plan is for having your game distributed: Do you want to send it wherever possible, or do you want to restrict its presence to those who've bought an exclusive license? It's up to you. Consider various options, experiment and conclude. Publishers will be explained in more detail in the monetization article.\n\nThere are also independent portals collecting interesting games like HTML5Games.com, GameArter.com, MarketJS.com, GameFlare, GameDistribution.com, GameSaturn.com, Playmox.com, or CrazyGames where you can send your game in and it will get some natural promotion because of the big traffic those sites attract. Some of these take your files and host them on their server, whereas others only link to your website or embed your game on their site. Such exposure may just provide promotion for your game, or if you have adverts shown beside your game (or other money making options) it may also provide monetization.\n\n## Web and native stores\nYou can also upload and publish your game directly to different types of stores, or marketplaces. To do that you'll have to prepare and package it to a build format specific for every app ecosystem you want to target it at. See Marketplaces — distribution platforms for more details of what marketplace types are available.\n\n## Marketplaces — Distribution platforms\nLet's see what the available options are regarding the marketplaces/stores available for different platforms and operating systems.\n\n**Note:** These are the most popular distribution platforms, but this is not to say these are the only options. Instead of trying to add your game to the thousands of others in the iOS store say, you can also try to find a niche and promote directly to the audience who would be interested in your games. Your creativity is critical here.\n\n## Web stores\nThe best platforms for HTML games are Web-based stores. You can prepare games for web stores by adding a manifest file and other data, such as resources, in a zipped package. Not many modifications of the game itself are required.\n\n- The Chrome Web Store is also an attractive option — again, having a manifest file ready, zipping your game and filling in the online submission form is about all that's required.\n\n## Native mobile stores\nWhen it comes to the mobile market, there's the Apple App Store for iOS, Google Play for Android and all the rest of the competition. Native stores are already filled with established devs selling great games, so you have to be talented and lucky to get noticed.\n\n- The iOS App Store is quite hard to get into as there are strict requirements games have to meet, and you'll have to wait a week or two to get accepted. Plus, it's the most prominent mobile store, with hundreds of thousands of apps, so it's extremely hard to stand out from the crowd.\n- Google Play's requirements are less strict, so the store is polluted with low quality games. It's still quite hard to be noticed there as the number of apps submitted daily is huge. It's harder to earn money here too — most of the paid games from iOS are published as free games on Android, with monetization coming from in-app purchases (IAPs) or ads.\n- Other stores for native mobile platforms like Windows Phone or Blackberry are working hard to get a piece of the cake, and are way behind the competition. It can be good to submit your game there as it will be a lot easier to be noticed.\n\n## Native desktop\nTo broaden your audience you can hit the desktop ecosystem with your HTML games too — just remember all the popular AAA games that take most of the market share, and think carefully about whether this suits your strategy. To do the desktop thing properly you should support all three operating systems: Windows, macOS and Linux. The biggest desktop store for games is definitely Steam — indie developers can get on Steam via the Steam Direct program. Remember that you have to deal with the cross-platform issues yourself by uploading separate versions for different platforms.\n\nAfter you've covered Steam, there's plenty of buzz around initiatives like Humble Bundle where the most popular indie games get presented to a broader audience. It's more like an excellent promotional opportunity than a way to earn a lot of money, however, as the prices paid for the games in a bundle are usually quite low.\n\n## Packaging games\nThe web is the first and the best choice for HTML games, but if you want to reach a broader audience and distribute your game in a closed ecosystem, you still can do that by packaging it. The good thing is that you don't need a few separate teams working on the same game for different platforms — you can build it once and use tools to package the game for native stores. The resulting packages are usually pretty reliable, but you should still test them and be on the lookout for small issues or bugs to fix.\n\n## Available tools\nThere are various tools to choose from depending on your skills, preferred frameworks or target platforms. It's all about picking the best tool for your particular task.\n\n- Ejecta — a tool specifically for packaging games created with the ImpactJS framework for iOS, built by the ImpactJS author. It provides seamless integration with ImpactJS, but it supports only one framework and app store.\n- NW.js — formerly known as Node-WebKit, this is the first choice when it comes to building a desktop game that works on Windows, Mac and Linux. The distributions are packaged with the WebKit engine to provide rendering on any platform.\n\nOther alternative tools are:\n\n- Intel XDK — an exciting alternative, similar to CocoonIO.\n- Electron — known as Atom Shell — is an open-sourced and cross-platform tool from GitHub.\n- Manifold.js — this tool from the Microsoft team can create native distributions of HTML games from iOS, Android, and Windows.\n\n## Summary\nDistribution is the way to give the world access to your game. There are many options available and there's no single good answer as to which is the best. When you've published the game it's time to focus on promotion — letting people know your game exists. Without promotion, they wouldn't even be able to learn about it and play it.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Publishing_games/Game_distribution", "title": "Game distribution", "description": "This article covers all you need to know about the ways in which you can distribute your newly created game into the wild.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Secure Contexts\"?\n\nAssistant: A secure context is a Window or Worker for which certain minimum standards of authentication and confidentiality are met. Many Web APIs and features are accessible only in a secure context.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Why should some features be restricted?\nSome APIs on the web are very powerful, giving an attacker the ability to do the following and more:\n\n- Invade a user's privacy.\n- Get low-level access to a user's computer.\n- Get access to data such as user credentials.\n\n## When is a context considered secure?\nA context is considered secure when it meets certain minimum standards of authentication and confidentiality defined in the Secure Contexts specification. A particular document is considered to be in a secure context when it is the active document of a top-level browsing context (basically, a containing window or tab) that is a secure context.\n\nFor example, even for a document delivered over TLS within an <iframe>, its context is **not** considered secure if it has an ancestor that was not also delivered over TLS.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that if a non-secure context causes a new window to be created (with or without specifying noopener), then the fact that the opener was insecure has no effect on whether the new window is considered secure. That's because the determination of whether a particular document is in a secure context is based only on considering it within the top-level browsing context with which it is associated — and not whether a non-secure context happened to be used to create it.\n\nLocally-delivered resources such as those with http://127.0.0.1 URLs, http://localhost and http://*.localhost URLs (e.g. http://dev.whatever.localhost/), and file:// URLs are also considered to have been delivered securely.\n\n**Note:**\nFirefox 84 and later support http://localhost and http://*.localhost URLs as trustworthy origins (earlier versions did not, because localhost was not guaranteed to map to a local/loopback address).\n\nResources that are not local, to be considered secure, must meet the following criteria:\n\n- must be served over https:// or wss:// URLs\n- the security properties of the network channel used to deliver the resource must not be considered deprecated.\n\n## Feature detection\nPages can use feature detection to check whether they are in a secure context or not by using the Window.isSecureContext or WorkerGlobalScope.isSecureContext boolean, which is exposed on the global scope.\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [Secure Contexts](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-secure-contexts/) |\n\n## See also\n- [Platform features restricted to secure contexts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts/features_restricted_to_secure_contexts) — a list of the features available only in secure contexts\n- [Window.isSecureContext](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/isSecureContext) and [WorkerGlobalScope.isSecureContext](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WorkerGlobalScope/isSecureContext)\n- [https://permission.site](https://permission.site/) — A site that allows you to check what API permission checks your browser employs, over HTTP and HTTPS\n- [Strict-Transport-Security](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) HTTP header\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts", "title": "Secure Contexts", "description": "A secure context is a Window or Worker for which certain minimum standards of authentication and confidentiality are met.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"CSS transform\"?\n\nAssistant: The transform CSS property lets you rotate, scale, skew, or translate an element. It modifies the coordinate space of the CSS visual formatting model.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Introduction\nThe **`transform`** CSS property lets you rotate, scale, skew, or translate an element. It modifies the coordinate space of the CSS [visual formatting model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Visual_formatting_model).\n\n## Try it\nIf the property has a value different from `none`, a [stacking context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_positioned_layout/Understanding_z-index/Stacking_context) will be created. In that case, the element will act as a [containing block](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_display/Containing_block) for any `position: fixed;` or `position: absolute;` elements that it contains.\n\n## Warning\nOnly transformable elements can be `transform` ed. That is, all elements whose layout is governed by the CSS box model except for: [non-replaced inline boxes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Inline-level_content), [table-column boxes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/col), and [table-column-group boxes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/colgroup).\n\n## Syntax\nThe `transform` property may be specified as either the keyword value `none` or as one or more `<transform-function>` values.\n\n## Values\n[`<transform-function>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-function) One or more of the [CSS transform functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-function) to be applied. The transform functions are multiplied in order from left to right, meaning that composite transforms are effectively [applied in order from right to left](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform#transform_order).\n\n## Accessibility\nScaling/zooming animations are problematic for accessibility, as they are a common trigger for certain types of migraine. If you need to include such animations on your website, you should provide a control to allow users to turn off animations, preferably site-wide.\n\n## Formal definition\n| [Initial value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/initial_value) | `none` |\n| Applies to | transformable elements |\n| [Inherited](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/Inheritance) | no |\n| Percentages | refer to the size of bounding box |\n| [Computed value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/computed_value) | as specified, but with relative lengths converted into absolute lengths |\n| [Animation type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animated_properties) | a transform |\n| Creates [stacking context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_positioned_layout/Understanding_z-index/Stacking_context) | yes |\n\n## Formal syntax\n```\ntransform =\n  none              |\n  <transform-list>\n\n<transform-list> =\n  <transform-function>+\n```\n\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform", "title": "CSS transform", "description": "The transform CSS property lets you rotate, scale, skew, or translate an element.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"HTML Content Categories\"?\n\nAssistant: This article discusses the various content categories in HTML, which group elements that share common characteristics and define their behavior and associated rules.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Main content categories\nMost HTML elements are a member of one or more content categories — these categories group elements that share common characteristics. This is a loose grouping (it doesn't actually create a relationship among elements of these categories), but they help define and describe the categories' shared behavior and their associated rules, especially when you come upon their intricate details. It's also possible for elements to not be a member of any of these categories.\n\n## Metadata content\nElements belonging to the metadata content category modify the presentation or the behavior of the rest of the document, set up links to other documents, or convey other out-of-band information. Everything in the <head>, including the <title>, <link>, <script>, <style>, and the lesser used <base>, is metadata content. There is a <meta> element for metadata that cannot be represented by these other elements. The metadata elements are: <base>, <link>, <meta>, <noscript>, <script>, <style>, <title>.\n\n## Flow content\nFlow content is a broad category that encompasses most elements that can go inside the <body> element, including heading elements, sectioning elements, phrasing elements, embedding elements, interactive elements, and form-related elements. It also includes text nodes (but not those that only consist of white space characters). The flow elements are: <a>, <abbr>, <address>, <article>, <aside>, <audio>, <b>, <bdo>, <bdi>, <blockquote>, <br>, <button>, <canvas>, <cite>, <code>, <data>, <datalist>, <del>, <details>, <dfn>, <dialog>, <div>, <dl>, <em>, <embed>, <fieldset>, <figure>, <footer>, <form>, <h1>- <h6>, <header>, <hgroup>, <hr>, <i>, <iframe>, <img>, <input>, <ins>, <kbd>, <label>, <main>, <map>, <mark>, <math>, <menu>, <meter>, <nav>, <noscript>, <object>, <ol>, <output>, <p>, <picture>, <pre>, <progress>, <q>, <ruby>, <s>, <samp>, <search>, <script>, <section>, <select>, <slot>, <small>, <span>, <strong>, <sub>, <sup>, <svg>, <table>, <template>, <textarea>, <time>, <u>, <ul>, <var>, <video>, <wbr>.\n\n## Sectioning content\nSectioning content, a subset of flow content, creates a section in the current outline defining the scope of <header> and <footer> elements. The sectioning elements are: <article>, <aside>, <nav>, <section>.\n\n## Heading content\nHeading content, a subset of flow content, defines the title of a section. This definition applies both to sections marked by an explicit sectioning content elements and to those implicitly defined by the heading content itself. The heading elements are: <h1>- <h6>, <hgroup>.\n\n## Phrasing content\nPhrasing content, a subset of flow content, refers to the text and the markup within a document. Sequences of phrasing content make up paragraphs. The phrasing elements are: <abbr>, <audio>, <b>, <bdi>, <bdo>, <br>, <button>, <canvas>, <cite>, <code>, <data>, <datalist>, <dfn>, <em>, <embed>, <i>, <iframe>, <img>, <input>, <kbd>, <label>, <mark>, <math>, <meter>, <noscript>, <object>, <output>, <picture>, <progress>, <q>, <ruby>, <s>, <samp>, <script>, <select>, <slot>, <small>, <span>, <strong>, <sub>, <sup>, <svg>, <template>, <textarea>, <time>, <u>, <var>, <video>, <wbr>.\n\n## Embedded content\nEmbedded content, a subset of flow content, imports another resource or inserts content from another markup language or namespace into the document. The embedded content elements are: <audio>, <canvas>, <embed>, <iframe>, <img>, <math>, <object>, <picture>, <svg>, <video>.\n\n## Interactive content\nInteractive content, a subset of flow content, includes elements that are specifically designed for user interaction. The interactive content elements are: <button>, <details>, <embed>, <iframe>, <label>, <select>, <textarea>. Some elements belong to this category only under specific conditions: <a>, <audio>, <img>, <input>, <object>, <video>.\n\n## Palpable content\nContent is palpable when it's neither empty nor hidden; it is content that is rendered and is substantive. Elements whose model is flow content should have at least one node which is palpable. The palpable elements are: <a>, <abbr>, <address>, <article>, <aside>, <b>, <bdi>, <bdo>, <blockquote>, <button>, <canvas>, <cite>, <code>, <data>, <del>, <details>, <dfn>, <div>, <em>, <embed>, <fieldset>, <footer>, <figure>, <form>, <iframe>, <img>, <ins>, <kbd>, <label>, <main>, <map>, <mark>, <math>, <meter>, <nav>, <object>, <p>, <picture>, <pre>, <progress>, <q>, <ruby>, <s>, <samp>, <search>, <section>, <select>, <small>, <span>, <strong>, <sub>, <sup>, <svg>, <table>, <textarea>, <time>, <u>, <var>, <video>.\n\n## Form-associated content\nForm-associated content is a subset of flow content comprising elements that have a form owner, exposed by a form attribute, and can be used everywhere flow content is expected. A form owner is either the containing <form> element or the element whose id is specified in the form attribute. The form-associated elements are: <button>, <fieldset>, <input>, <label>, <meter>, <object>, <output>, <progress>, <select>, <textarea>.\n\n## Secondary content categories\nThere are some secondary classifications of elements that can be useful to be aware of as well.\n\n## Script-supporting elements\nScript-supporting elements are elements that don't directly contribute to a document's rendered output. Instead, they serve to support scripts, either by containing or specifying script code directly or by specifying data that will be used by scripts. The script-supporting elements are: <script>, <template>.\n\n## Transparent content model\nIf an element has a transparent content model, then its contents must be structured such that they would be valid HTML, even if the transparent element were removed and replaced by the child elements. For example, the <del> and <ins> elements are transparent.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Content_categories", "title": "HTML Content Categories", "description": "This article discusses the various content categories in HTML, which group elements that share common characteristics and define their behavior and associated rules.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 13, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 00:42:37", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"description": "Most HTML elements are a member of one or more content categories — these categories group elements that share common characteristics.

In contrast, [`margin`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin) creates extra space _around_ an element.\n\n## Constituent properties\nThis property is a shorthand for the following CSS properties:\n\n- [`padding-top`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding-top)\n- [`padding-right`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding-right)\n- [`padding-bottom`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding-bottom)\n- [`padding-left`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding-left)\n\n## Syntax\nThe `padding` property may be specified using one, two, three, or four values.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Push API\"?\n\nAssistant: The Push API gives web applications the ability to receive messages pushed to them from a server, whether or not the web app is in the foreground, or even currently loaded, on a user agent. This lets developers deliver asynchronous notifications and updates to users that opt in, resulting in better engagement with timely new content.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Push concepts and usage\nWhen implementing PushManager subscriptions, it is vitally important that you protect against CSRF/XSRF issues in your app. See the following articles for more information:\n\n- [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [Preventing CSRF and XSRF Attacks](https://blog.codinghorror.com/preventing-csrf-and-xsrf-attacks/)\n\nFor an app to receive push messages, it has to have an active [service worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API). When the service worker is active, it can subscribe to push notifications, using [`PushManager.subscribe()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PushManager/subscribe).\n\nThe resulting [`PushSubscription`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PushSubscription) includes all the information that the application needs to send a push message: an endpoint and the encryption key needed for sending data.\n\nThe service worker will be started as necessary to handle incoming push messages, which are delivered to the [`onpush`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerGlobalScope/push_event \"onpush\") event handler. This allows apps to react to push messages being received, for example, by displaying a notification (using [`ServiceWorkerRegistration.showNotification()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerRegistration/showNotification).)\n\nEach subscription is unique to a service worker. The endpoint for the subscription is a unique [capability URL](https://www.w3.org/TR/capability-urls/): knowledge of the endpoint is all that is necessary to send a message to your application. The endpoint URL therefore needs to be kept secret, or other applications might be able to send push messages to your application.\n\nActivating a service worker to deliver a push message can result in increased resource usage, particularly of the battery. Different browsers have different schemes for handling this, there is currently no standard mechanism. Firefox allows a limited number (quota) of push messages to be sent to an application, although Push messages that generate notifications are exempt from this limit. The limit is refreshed each time the site is visited. In Chrome there are no limits.\n\n## Interfaces\n[`PushEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PushEvent)\n\nRepresents a push action, sent to the [global scope](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerGlobalScope) of a [`ServiceWorker`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorker). It contains information sent from an application to a [`PushSubscription`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PushSubscription).\n\n[`PushManager`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PushManager)\n\nProvides a way to receive notifications from third-party servers, as well as request URLs for push notifications.\n\n[`PushMessageData`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PushMessageData)\n\nProvides access to push data sent by a server, and includes methods to manipulate the received data.\n\n[`PushSubscription`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PushSubscription)\n\nProvides a subscription's URL endpoint, and allows unsubscribing from a push service.\n\n[`PushSubscriptionOptions`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PushSubscriptionOptions)\n\nRepresents the options associated with the push subscription.\n\n## Service worker additions\nThe following additions to the [Service Worker API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) have been specified in the Push API spec to provide an entry point for using Push messages. They also monitor and respond to push and subscription change events.\n\n[`ServiceWorkerRegistration.pushManager`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerRegistration/pushManager) Read only\n\nReturns a reference to the [`PushManager`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PushManager) interface for managing push subscriptions including subscribing, getting an active subscription, and accessing push permission status. This is the entry point into using Push messaging.\n\n[`onpush`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerGlobalScope/push_event \"onpush\")\n\nAn event handler fired whenever a [`push`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerGlobalScope/push_event \"push\") event occurs; that is, whenever a server push message is received.\n\n[`onpushsubscriptionchange`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerGlobalScope/pushsubscriptionchange_event \"onpushsubscriptionchange\")\n\nAn event handler fired whenever a [`pushsubscriptionchange`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerGlobalScope/pushsubscriptionchange_event \"pushsubscriptionchange\") event occurs; for example, when a push subscription has been invalidated, or is about to be invalidated (e.g. when a push service sets an expiration time).\n\n## Examples\nMozilla's [ServiceWorker Cookbook](https://github.com/mdn/serviceworker-cookbook) contains many useful Push examples.\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [Push API\\<br>\\# pushevent-interface](https://w3c.github.io/push-api/#pushevent-interface) |\n| [Push API\\<br>\\# pushmessagedata-interface](https://w3c.github.io/push-api/#pushmessagedata-interface) |\n\n## Browser compatibility\n### [api.PushEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API#api.pushevent)\n\n|  | desktop | mobile |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Chrome | Edge | Firefox | Opera | Safari | Chrome Android | Firefox for Android | Opera Android | Safari on iOS | Samsung Internet | WebView Android | WebView on iOS |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `PushEvent` | Chrome – Full support<br>Chrome42<br>Toggle history | Edge – Full support<br>Edge17<br>Toggle history | Firefox – Full support<br>Firefox44<br>Toggle history | Opera – Full support<br>Opera37<br>Toggle history | Safari – Full support<br>Safari16<br>footnote<br>Toggle history | Chrome Android – Full support<br>Chrome Android42<br>Toggle history | Firefox for Android – Full support<br>Firefox for Android48<br>Toggle history | Opera Android – Full support<br>Opera Android37<br>Toggle history | Safari on iOS – Full support<br>Safari on iOS16.4<br>footnote<br>Toggle history | Samsung Internet – Full support<br>Samsung Internet4.0<br>Toggle history | WebView Android – No support<br>WebView AndroidNo<br>Toggle history | WebView on iOS – No support<br>WebView on iOSNo<br>Toggle history |\n| [`PushEvent()` constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PushEvent/PushEvent) | Chrome – Full support<br>Chrome42<br>Toggle history | Edge – Full support<br>Edge17<br>Toggle history | Firefox – Full support<br>Firefox44<br>Toggle history | Opera – Full support<br>Opera37<br>Toggle history | Safari – Full support<br>Safari16<br>footnote<br>Toggle history | Chrome Android – Full support<br>Chrome Android42<br>Toggle history | Firefox for Android – Full support<br>Firefox for Android48<br>Toggle history | Opera Android – Full support<br>Opera Android37<br>Toggle history | Safari on iOS – Full support<br>Safari on iOS16.4<br>footnote<br>Toggle history | Samsung Internet – Full support<br>Samsung Internet4.0<br>Toggle history | WebView Android – No support<br>WebView AndroidNo<br>Toggle history | WebView on iOS – No support<br>WebView on iOSNo<br>footnote<br>Toggle history |\n| [`data`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PushEvent/data) | Chrome – Full support<br>Chrome50<br>Toggle history | Edge – Full support<br>Edge17<br>Toggle history | Firefox – Full support<br>Firefox44<br>Toggle history | Opera – Full support<br>Opera37<br>Toggle history | Safari – Full support<br>Safari16<br>footnote<br>Toggle history | Chrome Android – Full support<br>Chrome Android50<br>Toggle history | Firefox for Android – Full support<br>Firefox for Android48<br>Toggle history | Opera Android – Full support<br>Opera Android37<br>Toggle history | Safari on iOS – Full support<br>Safari on iOS16.4<br>footnote<br>Toggle history | Samsung Internet – Full support<br>Samsung Internet5.0<br>Toggle history | WebView Android – No support<br>WebView AndroidNo<br>Toggle history | WebView on iOS – No support<br>WebView on iOSNo<br>footnote<br>Toggle history |\n\n### Legend\n\nTip: you can click/tap on a cell for more information.\n\nFull supportFull support\n\nNo supportNo support\n\nSee implementation notes.\n\nThe compatibility table on this page is generated from structured data.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Inheritance and the prototype chain\"?\n\nAssistant: This page covers the concept of inheritance in JavaScript, explaining how it is implemented through prototypes and the prototype chain, along with various methods of creating and manipulating prototype chains.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Inheritance with the prototype chain\nIn programming, inheritance refers to passing down characteristics from a parent to a child so that a new piece of code can reuse and build upon the features of an existing one. JavaScript implements inheritance by using objects. Each object has an internal link to another object called its prototype. That prototype object has a prototype of its own, and so on until an object is reached with null as its prototype. By definition, null has no prototype and acts as the final link in this prototype chain. It is possible to mutate any member of the prototype chain or even swap out the prototype at runtime, so concepts like static dispatching do not exist in JavaScript.\n\n## Inheriting properties\nJavaScript objects are dynamic \"bags\" of properties (referred to as own properties). JavaScript objects have a link to a prototype object. When trying to access a property of an object, the property will not only be sought on the object but on the prototype of the object, the prototype of the prototype, and so on until either a property with a matching name is found or the end of the prototype chain is reached.\n\nNote: Following the ECMAScript standard, the notation someObject.[[Prototype]] is used to designate the prototype of someObject. The [[Prototype]] internal slot can be accessed and modified with the Object.getPrototypeOf() and Object.setPrototypeOf() functions respectively. This is equivalent to the JavaScript accessor __proto__ which is non-standard but de-facto implemented by many JavaScript engines. To prevent confusion while keeping it succinct, in our notation we will avoid using obj.__proto__ but use obj.[[Prototype]] instead. This corresponds to Object.getPrototypeOf(obj). It should not be confused with the func.prototype property of functions, which instead specifies the [[Prototype]] to be assigned to all instances of objects created by the given function when used as a constructor.\n\n## Inheriting \"methods\"\nJavaScript does not have \"methods\" in the form that class-based languages define them. In JavaScript, any function can be added to an object in the form of a property. An inherited function acts just as any other property, including property shadowing as shown above (in this case, a form of method overriding). When an inherited function is executed, the value of this points to the inheriting object, not to the prototype object where the function is an own property.\n\n## Constructors\nThe power of prototypes is that we can reuse a set of properties if they should be present on every instance — especially for methods. Suppose we are to create a series of boxes, where each box is an object that contains a value which can be accessed through a getValue function. A naive implementation would be:\n\nconst boxes = [\n  { value: 1, getValue() { return this.value; } },\n  { value: 2, getValue() { return this.value; } },\n  { value: 3, getValue() { return this.value; } },\n];\n\nThis is subpar, because each instance has its own function property that does the same thing, which is redundant and unnecessary. Instead, we can move getValue to the [[Prototype]] of all boxes:\n\nconst boxPrototype = {\n  getValue() {\n    return this.value;\n  },\n};\n\nconst boxes = [\n  { value: 1, __proto__: boxPrototype },\n  { value: 2, __proto__: boxPrototype },\n  { value: 3, __proto__: boxPrototype },\n];\n\nThis way, all boxes' getValue method will refer to the same function, lowering memory usage.\n\n## Implicit constructors of literals\nSome literal syntaxes in JavaScript create instances that implicitly set the [[Prototype]]. For example:\n\n// Object literals (without the `__proto__` key) automatically\n// have `Object.prototype` as their `[[Prototype]]`\nconst object = { a: 1 };\nObject.getPrototypeOf(object) === Object.prototype; // true\n\n// Array literals automatically have `Array.prototype` as their `[[Prototype]]`\nconst array = [1, 2, 3];\nObject.getPrototypeOf(array) === Array.prototype; // true\n\n// RegExp literals automatically have `RegExp.prototype` as their `[[Prototype]]`\nconst regexp = /abc/;\nObject.getPrototypeOf(regexp) === RegExp.prototype; // true\n\nWe can \"de-sugar\" them into their constructor form.\n\n## Building longer inheritance chains\nThe Constructor.prototype property will become the [[Prototype]] of the constructor's instances, as-is — including Constructor.prototype's own [[Prototype]]. By default, Constructor.prototype is a plain object — that is, Object.getPrototypeOf(Constructor.prototype) === Object.prototype. The only exception is Object.prototype itself, whose [[Prototype]] is null — that is, Object.getPrototypeOf(Object.prototype) === null. Therefore, a typical constructor will build the following prototype chain:\n\nfunction Constructor() {}\n\nconst obj = new Constructor();\n// obj ---> Constructor.prototype ---> Object.prototype ---> null\n\nTo build longer prototype chains, we can set the [[Prototype]] of Constructor.prototype via the Object.setPrototypeOf() function.\n\n## Inspecting prototypes: a deeper dive\nLet's look at what happens behind the scenes in a bit more detail. In JavaScript, as mentioned above, functions are able to have properties. All functions have a special property named prototype. Please note that the code below is free-standing (it is safe to assume there is no other JavaScript on the webpage other than the below code). For the best learning experience, it is highly recommended that you open a console, navigate to the \"console\" tab, copy-and-paste in the below JavaScript code, and run it by pressing the Enter/Return key.\n\n## Different ways of creating and mutating prototype chains\nWe have encountered many ways to create objects and change their prototype chains. We will systematically summarize the different ways, comparing each approach's pros and cons.\n\n## Performance\nThe lookup time for properties that are high up on the prototype chain can have a negative impact on the performance, and this may be significant in the code where performance is critical. Additionally, trying to access nonexistent properties will always traverse the full prototype chain.\n\n## Conclusion\nJavaScript may be a bit confusing for developers coming from Java or C++, as it's all dynamic, all runtime, and it has no static types at all. Everything is either an object (instance) or a function (constructor), and even functions themselves are instances of the Function constructor.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain", "title": "Inheritance and the prototype chain", "description": "This page covers the concept of inheritance in JavaScript, explaining how it is implemented through prototypes and the prototype chain, along with various methods of creating and manipulating prototype chains.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 10, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 00:44:37", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "language": "en-US", "og:locale": "en_US", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "og:description": "In programming, inheritance refers to passing down characteristics from a parent to a child so that a new piece of code can reuse and build upon the features of an existing one.

To create a point using an object, you can instead use DOMPointReadOnly.fromPoint().\n\n## Instance properties\n- DOMPointReadOnly.x Read only: The point's horizontal coordinate, x.\n- DOMPointReadOnly.y Read only: The point's vertical coordinate, y.\n- DOMPointReadOnly.z Read only: The point's depth coordinate, z.\n- DOMPointReadOnly.w Read only: The point's perspective value, w.\n\n## Static methods\n- DOMPointReadOnly.fromPoint(): A static method that creates a new DOMPointReadOnly object given the coordinates provided in the specified object.\n\n## Instance methods\n- matrixTransform(): Applies a matrix transform specified as an object to the DOMPointReadOnly object.\n- toJSON(): Returns a JSON representation of the DOMPointReadOnly object.\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [Geometry Interfaces Module Level 1# DOMPoint](https://drafts.fxtf.org/geometry/#DOMPoint) |\n\n## Browser compatibility\n\n\n## See also\n- [DOMPoint](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMPoint)\n- [DOMRect](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMRect)\n- [DOMMatrix](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMMatrix)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMPointReadOnly", "title": "DOMPointReadOnly", "description": "The DOMPointReadOnly interface specifies the coordinate and perspective fields used by DOMPoint to define a 2D or 3D point in a coordinate system.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 8, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 00:44:50", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:locale": "en_US", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMPointReadOnly", "description": "Learn about the DOMPointReadOnly interface, including its constructor, properties, and methods, specifications and browser compatibility.", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "title": "DOMPointReadOnly - Web APIs | MDN", "ogDescription": "The DOMPointReadOnly interface specifies the coordinate and perspective fields used by DOMPoint to define a 2D or 3D point in a coordinate system.", "position": ["1", "2", "3"], "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMPointReadOnly", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "ogLocale": "en_US", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "ogTitle": "DOMPointReadOnly - Web APIs | MDN", "og:description": "The DOMPointReadOnly interface specifies the coordinate and perspective fields used by DOMPoint to define a 2D or 3D point in a coordinate system.", "og:image:height": "1080", "og:title": "DOMPointReadOnly - Web APIs | MDN", "language": "en-US", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "og:image:width": "1920", "og:image:type": "image/png", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "og:type": "website", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "scrapeId": "8b899ee0-c3a7-45cf-b80a-5cf3df95d268", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMPointReadOnly", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMPointReadOnly", "statusCode": 200}}}

You should have a basic work environment set up (as detailed in Installing basic software), and understand how to create and manage files (as detailed in Dealing with files). Both are parts of our Getting started with the web complete beginner's module.\n\n**Note:** If you are working on a computer/tablet/other device where you don't have the ability to create your own files, you could try out (most of) the code examples in an online coding program such as JSBin or Glitch.\n\n## Tutorials and challenges\nThis section includes various tutorials and challenges to help you practice HTML skills. Each tutorial covers a specific aspect of HTML, such as:\n\n- **Basic HTML syntax**: Covers the absolute basics of HTML, defining elements, attributes, and other important terms.\n- **What's in the head? Webpage metadata**: Discusses the head of an HTML document and its importance.\n- **Headings and paragraphs**: Explains how to use HTML to provide fundamental page structure.\n- **Emphasis and importance**: Focuses on HTML elements that apply emphasis and importance to text.\n- **Lists**: Shows how to define different types of lists in HTML.\n- **Structuring documents**: Looks into how to plan a basic website structure using HTML.\n- **Advanced text features**: Discusses less known HTML elements for defining text semantics.\n- **Creating links**: Teaches the syntax required to make a link and discusses best practices.\n- **Marking up a letter**: A challenge to test your HTML text formatting skills.\n- **Structuring a page of content**: A challenge to structure a page of content ready for CSS layout.\n- **HTML images**: Covers how to use the <img> element and related concepts.\n- **HTML video and audio**: Discusses adding video and audio players to HTML documents.\n- **HTML table basics**: Introduces HTML tables and their structure.\n- **HTML table accessibility**: Focuses on accessibility features for HTML tables.\n- **Forms and buttons in HTML**: Provides an introduction to HTML forms and buttons.\n- **Debugging HTML**: Introduces tools to find and fix errors in HTML.\n\n## Additional tutorials\nThese tutorials are not part of the learning pathway, but they are interesting nonetheless — you should consider these as stretch goals, to optionally study when you are done with the main Core articles. Topics include:\n\n- **Including vector graphics in HTML**: How to include vector graphics in your webpage.\n- **From object to iframe — general embedding technologies**: Discusses embedding media and other content types into webpages.\n\n## See also\nAdditional resources for learning HTML and CSS, including links to Codecademy and Scrimba courses.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content", "title": "Structuring Content", "description": "This module covers the basics of HTML, including document structure, links, lists, images, forms, and more, emphasizing the importance of semantics for accessibility and SEO.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 4, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 00:45:09", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "og:image:type": "image/png", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "og:image:width": "1920", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content", "language": "en-US", "title": "Structuring content with HTML - Learn web development | MDN", "og:description": "HTML is the technology that defines the content and structure of any website.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Authority\"?\n\nAssistant: The authority of a URI is the section that comes after the scheme and before the path. It may have up to three parts: user information, host, and port.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Syntax\nThe syntax for authority in a URI can be represented as follows:\n\n```\nhost\nhost:port\nuser@host\nuser@host:port\n```\n\n## host\nThe host is usually the domain name or IP address of the server hosting the resource. The domain name is resolved to an IP address using the Domain Name System.\n\n## port (Optional)\nThe port is a number that indicates the port on which the server is listening for requests. It is optional and defaults to 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS. Other schemes may define their own defaults or make it mandatory.\n\n## user (Optional)\nThe user is optional and is used for authentication purposes. It is not commonly used in web URIs.\n\n## Warning\nProviding user information directly in HTTP URLs is not recommended, as it can expose sensitive information. Use other methods like HTTP authentication or session cookies instead. Sometimes, phishing sites trick users by displaying misleading URLs whose \"user\" part appears as if it's a domain name, known as semantic URL attack.\n\n## Examples\n1. `https://developer.mozilla.org`\n   - The host is `developer.mozilla.org`. The port is not specified but will default to 443 if accessed via `https:`.\n\n2. `http://localhost:8080`\n   - The host is `localhost` and the port is `8080`. `localhost` is a special host name that the browser resolves to the local address `127.0.0.1`.\n\n3. `postgresql://postgres:admin123@db:5432`\n   - The host is `db`, and the port is `5432`. It also specifies a user `postgres` and its password `admin123`. This can be used to connect to a PostgreSQL database.\n\n4. `https://cnn.example.com&story=breaking_news@10.0.0.1`\n   - A misleading URL that looks like it's pointing to a trusted website. However, the host name is `10.0.0.1`, and the `cnn.example.com&story=breaking_news` part is the \"user\".\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [Unknown specification](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986.html#section-3.1) |\n\n## See also\n- [URIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI)\n- [Choosing between www and non-www URLs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Guides/Choosing_between_www_and_non-www_URLs)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Authority", "title": "Authority", "description": "The authority of a URI is the section that comes after the scheme and before the path.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Service Worker API\"?\n\nAssistant: Service workers essentially act as proxy servers that sit between web applications, the browser, and the network (when available). They are intended, among other things, to enable the creation of effective offline experiences, intercept network requests, and take appropriate action based on whether the network is available, and update assets residing on the server. They will also allow access to push notifications and background sync APIs.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Service worker concepts and usage\nA service worker is an event-driven worker registered against an origin and a path. It takes the form of a JavaScript file that can control the web page/site that it is associated with, intercepting and modifying navigation and resource requests, and caching resources in a very granular fashion to give you complete control over how your app behaves in certain situations (the most obvious one being when the network is not available).\n\nService workers run in a worker context: they therefore have no DOM access and run on a different thread to the main JavaScript that powers your app. They are non-blocking and designed to be fully asynchronous. As a consequence, APIs such as synchronous XHR and Web Storage can't be used inside a service worker.\n\nService workers can't import JavaScript modules dynamically, and import() will throw if it is called in a service worker global scope. Static imports using the import statement are allowed.\n\nService workers only run over HTTPS, for security reasons. Most significantly, HTTP connections are susceptible to malicious code injection by man in the middle attacks, and such attacks could be worse if allowed access to these powerful APIs. In Firefox, service worker APIs are also hidden and cannot be used when the user is in private browsing mode.\n\nNote: On Firefox, for testing you can run service workers over HTTP (insecurely); simply check the Enable Service Workers over HTTP (when toolbox is open) option in the Firefox DevTools options/gear menu.\n\nNote: Unlike previous attempts in this area such as AppCache, service workers don't make assumptions about what you are trying to do, but then break when those assumptions are not exactly right. Instead, service workers give you much more granular control.\n\nNote: Service workers make heavy use of promises, as generally they will wait for responses to come through, after which they will respond with a success or failure action. The promises architecture is ideal for this.\n\n## Registration\nA service worker is first registered using the ServiceWorkerContainer.register() method. If successful, your service worker will be downloaded to the client and attempt installation/activation (see below) for URLs accessed by the user inside the whole origin, or a subset specified by you.\n\n## Download, install and activate\nAt this point, your service worker will observe the following lifecycle:\n\n1. Download\n2. Install\n3. Activate\n\nThe service worker is immediately downloaded when a user first accesses a service worker–controlled site/page.\n\nAfter that, it is updated when:\n- A navigation to an in-scope page occurs.\n- An event is fired on the service worker and it hasn't been downloaded in the last 24 hours.\n\nInstallation is attempted when the downloaded file is found to be new — either different to an existing service worker (byte-wise compared), or the first service worker encountered for this page/site.\n\nIf this is the first time a service worker has been made available, installation is attempted, then after a successful installation, it is activated.\n\nIf there is an existing service worker available, the new version is installed in the background, but not yet activated — at this point it is called the worker in waiting. It is only activated when there are no longer any pages loaded that are still using the old service worker. As soon as there are no more pages to be loaded, the new service worker activates (becoming the active worker). Activation can happen sooner using ServiceWorkerGlobalScope.skipWaiting() and existing pages can be claimed by the active worker using Clients.claim().\n\nYou can listen for the install event; a standard action is to prepare your service worker for usage when this fires, for example by creating a cache using the built-in storage API, and placing assets inside it that you'll want for running your app offline.\n\nThere is also an activate event. The point where this event fires is generally a good time to clean up old caches and other things associated with the previous version of your service worker.\n\nYour service worker can respond to requests using the FetchEvent event. You can modify the response to these requests in any way you want, using the FetchEvent.respondWith() method.\n\nNote: Because install/activate events could take a while to complete, the service worker spec provides a waitUntil() method. Once it is called on install or activate events with a promise, functional events such as fetch and push will wait until the promise is successfully resolved.\n\nFor a complete tutorial to show how to build up your first basic example, read Using Service Workers.\n\n## Using static routing to control how resources are fetched\nService workers can incur an unnecessary performance cost — when a page is loaded for the first time in a while, the browser has to wait for the service worker to start up and run to know what content to load and whether it should come from a cache or the network.\n\nIf you already know ahead of time where certain content should be fetched from, you can bypass the service worker altogether and fetch resources immediately. The InstallEvent.addRoutes() method can be used to implement this use case and more.\n\n## Other use case ideas\nService workers are also intended to be used for such things as:\n- Background data synchronization.\n- Responding to resource requests from other origins.\n- Receiving centralized updates to expensive-to-calculate data such as geolocation or gyroscope, so multiple pages can make use of one set of data.\n- Client-side compiling and dependency management of CoffeeScript, less, CJS/AMD modules, etc. for development purposes.\n- Hooks for background services.\n- Custom templating based on certain URL patterns.\n- Performance enhancements, for example, pre-fetching resources that the user is likely to need soon, such as the next few pictures in a photo album.\n- API mocking.\n\nIn the future, service workers will be able to do several other useful things for the web platform that will bring it closer to native app viability. Interestingly, other specifications can and will start to make use of the service worker context, for example:\n- Background synchronization: Start up a service worker even when no users are at the site, so caches can be updated, etc.\n- Reacting to push messages: Start up a service worker to send users a message to tell them new content is available.\n- Reacting to a particular time & date.\n- Entering a geo-fence.\n\n## Interfaces\nCache\nRepresents the storage for Request / Response object pairs that are cached as part of the ServiceWorker life cycle.\n\nCacheStorage\nRepresents the storage for Cache objects. It provides a master directory of all the named caches that a ServiceWorker can access, and maintains a mapping of string names to corresponding Cache objects.\n\nClient\nRepresents the scope of a service worker client. A service worker client is either a document in a browser context or a SharedWorker, which is controlled by an active worker.\n\nClients\nRepresents a container for a list of Client objects; the main way to access the active service worker clients at the current origin.\n\nExtendableEvent\nExtends the lifetime of the install and activate events dispatched on the ServiceWorkerGlobalScope, as part of the service worker lifecycle. This ensures that any functional events (like FetchEvent) are not dispatched to the ServiceWorker, until it upgrades database schemas, and deletes outdated cache entries, etc.\n\nExtendableMessageEvent\nThe event object of a message event fired on a service worker (when a channel message is received on the ServiceWorkerGlobalScope from another context) — extends the lifetime of such events.\n\nFetchEvent\nThe parameter passed into the onfetch handler, FetchEvent represents a fetch action that is dispatched on the ServiceWorkerGlobalScope of a ServiceWorker. It contains information about the request and resulting response, and provides the FetchEvent.respondWith() method, which allows us to provide an arbitrary response back to the controlled page.\n\nInstallEvent\nThe parameter passed into an install event handler function, the InstallEvent interface represents an install action that is dispatched on the ServiceWorkerGlobalScope of a ServiceWorker. As a child of ExtendableEvent, it ensures that functional events such as FetchEvent are not dispatched during installation.\n\nNavigationPreloadManager\nProvides methods for managing the preloading of resources with a service worker.\n\nServiceWorker\nRepresents a service worker. Multiple browsing contexts (e.g. pages, workers, etc.) can be associated with the same ServiceWorker object.\n\nServiceWorkerContainer\nProvides an object representing the service worker as an overall unit in the network ecosystem, including facilities to register, unregister, and update service workers, and access the state of service workers and their registrations.\n\nServiceWorkerGlobalScope\nRepresents the global execution context of a service worker.\n\nServiceWorkerRegistration\nRepresents a service worker registration.\n\nWindowClient\nRepresents the scope of a service worker client that is a document in a browser context, controlled by an active worker. This is a special type of Client object, with some additional methods and properties available.\n\n## Extensions to other interfaces\nWindow.caches and WorkerGlobalScope.caches\nReturns the CacheStorage object associated with the current context.\n\nNavigator.serviceWorker and WorkerNavigator.serviceWorker\nReturns a ServiceWorkerContainer object, which provides access to registration, removal, upgrade, and communication with the ServiceWorker objects for the associated document.\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [Service Workers](https://w3c.github.io/ServiceWorker/) |\n\n## See also\n- [Using Service Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API/Using_Service_Workers)\n- [Service Worker Lifecycle](https://web.dev/articles/service-worker-lifecycle)\n- [Service workers basic code example](https://github.com/mdn/dom-examples/tree/main/service-worker/simple-service-worker)\n- Web APIs that are related to the Service Worker API:\n  - [Background Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Background_Fetch_API)\n  - [Background Synchronization API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Background_Synchronization_API)\n  - [Content Index API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Content_Index_API)\n  - [Cookie Store API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cookie_Store_API)\n  - [Notifications API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notifications_API)\n  - [Payment Handler API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Payment_Handler_API)\n  - [Push API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API)\n  - [Web Periodic Background Synchronization API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Periodic_Background_Synchronization_API)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API", "title": "Service Worker API", "description": "Service workers essentially act as proxy servers that sit between web applications, the browser, and the network (when available).

Although they can also be nouns, these request methods are sometimes referred to as _HTTP verbs_. Each request method has its own semantics, but some characteristics are shared across multiple methods, specifically request methods can be [safe](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Safe/HTTP), [idempotent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Idempotent), or [cacheable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Cacheable).\n\n## GET\nThe `GET` method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using `GET` should only retrieve data and should not contain a request [content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP_Content).\n\n## HEAD\nThe `HEAD` method asks for a response identical to a `GET` request, but without a response body.\n\n## POST\nThe `POST` method submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.\n\n## PUT\nThe `PUT` method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request [content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP_Content).\n\n## DELETE\nThe `DELETE` method deletes the specified resource.\n\n## CONNECT\nThe `CONNECT` method establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource.\n\n## OPTIONS\nThe `OPTIONS` method describes the communication options for the target resource.\n\n## TRACE\nThe `TRACE` method performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.\n\n## PATCH\nThe `PATCH` method applies partial modifications to a resource.\n\n## Safe, idempotent, and cacheable request methods\nThe following table lists HTTP request methods and their categorization in terms of safety, cacheability, and idempotency.\n\n| Method | Safe | Idempotent | Cacheable |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| [`GET`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET) | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n|

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)\"?\n\nAssistant: This article provides an overview of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), explaining how it works, what requests use it, and the necessary HTTP headers involved.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## What requests use CORS?\nThis cross-origin sharing standard can enable cross-origin HTTP requests for:\n\n- Invocations of `fetch()` or `XMLHttpRequest`, as discussed above.\n- Web Fonts (for cross-domain font usage in `@font-face` within CSS), so that servers can deploy TrueType fonts that can only be loaded cross-origin and used by websites that are permitted to do so.\n- WebGL textures.\n- Images/video frames drawn to a canvas using `drawImage()`.\n- CSS Shapes from images.\n\n## Functional overview\nThe Cross-Origin Resource Sharing standard works by adding new HTTP headers that let servers describe which origins are permitted to read that information from a web browser. Additionally, for HTTP request methods that can cause side-effects on server data, the specification mandates that browsers \"preflight\" the request, soliciting supported methods from the server with the HTTP `OPTIONS` request method.\n\n## Examples of access control scenarios\nWe present three scenarios that demonstrate how Cross-Origin Resource Sharing works. All these examples use `fetch()`, which can make cross-origin requests in any supporting browser.\n\n## Simple requests\nSome requests don't trigger a CORS preflight. Those are called simple requests. A simple request is one that meets all the following conditions:\n\n- One of the allowed methods: `GET`, `HEAD`, `POST`\n- The only headers which are allowed to be manually set are the CORS-safelisted request-headers.\n\n## Preflighted requests\nUnlike simple requests, for \"preflighted\" requests the browser first sends an HTTP request using the `OPTIONS` method to the resource on the other origin, in order to determine if the actual request is safe to send.\n\n## Requests with credentials\nWhen making credentialed requests to a different domain, third-party cookie policies will still apply. The most interesting capability exposed by both `fetch()` or `XMLHttpRequest` and CORS is the ability to make \"credentialed\" requests that are aware of HTTP cookies and HTTP Authentication information.\n\n## The HTTP response headers\nThis section lists the HTTP response headers that servers return for access control requests as defined by the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing specification.\n\n## The HTTP request headers\nThis section lists headers that clients may use when issuing HTTP requests in order to make use of the cross-origin sharing feature.\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [Fetch\\<br>\\# http-access-control-allow-origin](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#http-access-control-allow-origin) |\n\n## Browser compatibility\n|  | desktop | mobile |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` | Chrome – Full support<br>Chrome4<br>Toggle history | Chrome Android – Full support<br>Chrome Android18<br>Toggle history |\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS", "title": "Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)", "description": "This article provides an overview of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), explaining how it works, what requests use it, and the necessary HTTP headers involved.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 10, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 00:50:00", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:locale": "en_US", "ogLocale": "en_US", "og:description": "Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"XRInputSource\"?\n\nAssistant: The XRInputSource interface describes a single source of control input which is part of the user's WebXR-compatible virtual or augmented reality system.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Instance properties\n`gamepad` Read only\n\nA `Gamepad` object describing the state of the buttons and axes on the XR input source, if it is a gamepad or comparable device. If the device isn't a gamepad-like device, this property's value is `null`.\n\n`gripSpace` Read only\n\nAn `XRSpace` whose origin tracks the pose which is used to render objects which should appear as if they're held in the hand indicated by `handedness`. The orientation of this space indicates the angle at which the hand is gripping the object. Read on in the main article on `gripSpace` for more details on how to use this space.\n\n`hand` Read only\n\nAn `XRHand` object providing access to the underlying hand-tracking device.\n\n`handedness` Read only\n\nA string that indicates which hand the device represented by this `XRInputSource` is being used in, if any. The value will be `left`, `right`, or `none`.\n\n`profiles` Read only\n\nAn array of strings, each specifying the name of an input profile describing the preferred visual representation and behavior of this input source.\n\n`targetRayMode` Read only\n\nA string indicating the methodology used to produce the target ray: `gaze`, `tracked-pointer`, or `screen`.\n\n`targetRaySpace` Read only\n\nAn `XRSpace` object defining the origin of the target ray and the direction in which it extends. This space is established using the method defined by `targetRayMode`.\n\n## Instance methods\nThe `XRInputSource` interface defines no methods.\n\n## Usage notes\n### Actions and the target ray\n\nIf the device provides an indication of the direction in which it is pointed, this is done using a **target ray**. This is a ray extending from the position of the device outward in the direction in which it is pointed.\n\n**A target ray emitted by a hand controller.**\n\n![A screenshot showing a target ray being emitted by a hand controller](https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/hand-controller-target-ray.gif)\n\nIf the device includes a trigger or other squeezable input, such as a hand gesture device that recognizes when the user squeezes their fist, that action is called a **primary squeeze action**. A primary squeeze action should correspond to a gripping act in reality, such as taking hold of an object or pressing a trigger on a tool or weapon. When a squeeze action begins, such as by the user pressing the trigger or tightening their grip, a `squeezestart` event is sent to the `XRSession`. Once the action is completed and the user has released the trigger or the grip, a `squeeze` event is sent. This is followed by a `squeezeend`, which is also sent if the action is aborted rather than completed.\n\nIf the device has a button or other pressable input control, it is a **primary input source**, and this button is a **primary action**. A primary action may occur when the user presses a button, clicks on a touchpad or the top button of a thumb stick, or uses a hand gesture or spoken command that invokes the button-like action. When a primary action begins, a `selectstart` event is sent to the `XRSession`. When the action has completed (such as when the user releases the button), a `select` event is sent. Finally, once that is done—or if the user aborts the action—a `selectend` event is sent to the session object.\n\nAn action may be aborted either by the user in some device-specific fashion or if the input device is disconnected before the action is completed.\n\n### Local coordinate system\n\nEach input source has its own local coordinate system, which is described by the `gripSpace` property, which is an `XRSpace` used to map the input's coordinate system into the world coordinate system. The grip space's coordinate system can then be used to render objects so they appear to be held in the user's hand.\n\n![A diagram showing the coordinate system defined by the gripSpace property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XRInputSource/xr-hand-axes.svg)\n\nFor more details on the input source's coordinate system, see the article that covers the `gripSpace` property in detail.\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [WebXR Device API<br># xrinputsource-interface](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr/#xrinputsource-interface) |\n\n## Browser compatibility\n\n\n## See also\n- [WebXR Device API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API)\n- [Inputs and input sources](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API/Inputs)\n- [`XRInputSourceArray`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XRInputSourceArray)\n- [`XRSpace`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XRSpace)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XRInputSource", "title": "XRInputSource", "description": "The XRInputSource interface describes a single source of control input which is part of the user's WebXR-compatible virtual or augmented reality system.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": false, "section_count": 6, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 00:50:16", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"language": "en-US", "og:locale": "en_US", "og:image:width": "1920", "ogTitle": "XRInputSource - Web APIs | MDN", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "position": ["1", "2", "3"], "og:image:type": "image/png", "og:description": "The WebXR Device API's XRInputSource interface describes a single source of control input which is part of the user's WebXR-compatible virtual or augmented reality system.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"DOMHighResTimeStamp\"?\n\nAssistant: The DOMHighResTimeStamp type is a double and is used to store a time value in milliseconds.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Overview\nThe DOMHighResTimeStamp type is a double and is used to store a time value in milliseconds.\n\nThis type can be used to describe a discrete point in time or a time interval (the difference in time between two discrete points in time). The starting time can be either a specific time determined by the script for a site or app, or the time origin.\n\nThe time, given in milliseconds, should be accurate to 5 µs (microseconds), with the fractional part of the number indicating fractions of a millisecond. However, if the browser is unable to provide a time value accurate to 5 µs (due, for example, to hardware or software constraints), the browser can represent the value as a time in milliseconds accurate to a millisecond. Also note the section below on reduced time precision controlled by browser preferences to avoid timing attacks and fingerprinting.\n\nFurther, if the device or operating system the user agent is running on doesn't have a clock accurate to the microsecond level, they may only be accurate to the millisecond.\n\n## Security requirements\nTo offer protection against timing attacks and fingerprinting, DOMHighResTimeStamp types are coarsened based on site isolation status.\n\n- Resolution in isolated contexts: 5 microseconds\n- Resolution in non-isolated contexts: 100 microseconds\n\nCross-origin isolate your site using the Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy and Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy headers:\n\nThese headers ensure a top-level document does not share a browsing context group with cross-origin documents. COOP process-isolates your document and potential attackers can't access to your global object if they were opening it in a popup, preventing a set of cross-origin attacks dubbed XS-Leaks.\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [High Resolution Time<br># dom-domhighrestimestamp](https://w3c.github.io/hr-time/#dom-domhighrestimestamp) |\n\n## See also\n- [`performance.now()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/now)\n- [`performance.timeOrigin`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance/timeOrigin)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMHighResTimeStamp", "title": "DOMHighResTimeStamp", "description": "The DOMHighResTimeStamp type is a double and is used to store a time value in milliseconds.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 4, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 00:50:39", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMHighResTimeStamp", "ogDescription": "The DOMHighResTimeStamp type is a double and is used to store a time value in milliseconds.", "og:locale": "en_US", "position": ["1", "2", "3"], "og:type": "website", "ogTitle": "DOMHighResTimeStamp - Web APIs | MDN", "language": "en-US", "og:image:width": "1920", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMHighResTimeStamp", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "og:image:type": "image/png", "description": "Learn about the DOMHighResTimeStamp interface, including specifications.", "og:title": "DOMHighResTimeStamp - Web APIs | MDN", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "og:description": "The DOMHighResTimeStamp type is a double and is used to store a time value in milliseconds.", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "ogLocale": "en_US", "og:image:height": "1080", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "title": "DOMHighResTimeStamp - Web APIs | MDN", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "scrapeId": "4e7cbb6e-8483-4f16-882d-65bce2dd2dfa", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMHighResTimeStamp", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMHighResTimeStamp", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"WebSockets API\"?\n\nAssistant: The WebSocket API makes it possible to open a two-way interactive communication session between the user's browser and a server. With this API, you can send messages to a server and receive responses without having to poll the server for a reply.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Overview\nThe WebSocket API provides two alternative mechanisms for creating and using web socket connections: the `WebSocket` interface and the `WebSocketStream` interface.\n\n- The `WebSocket` interface is stable and has good browser and server support. However it doesn't support backpressure. As a result, when messages arrive faster than the application can process them it will either fill up the device's memory by buffering those messages, become unresponsive due to 100% CPU usage, or both.\n- The `WebSocketStream` interface is a Promise-based alternative to `WebSocket`. It uses the Streams API to handle receiving and sending messages, meaning that socket connections can take advantage of stream backpressure automatically, regulating the speed of reading or writing to avoid bottlenecks in the application. However, `WebSocketStream` is non-standard and currently only supported in one rendering engine.\n\nAdditionally, the WebTransport API is expected to replace the WebSocket API for many applications. WebTransport is a versatile, low-level API that provides backpressure and many other features not supported by either `WebSocket` or `WebSocketStream`, such as unidirectional streams, out-of-order delivery, and unreliable data transmission via datagrams. WebTransport is more complex to use than WebSockets and its cross-browser support is not as wide, but it enables the implementation of sophisticated solutions. If standard WebSocket connections are a good fit for your use case and you need wide browser compatibility, you should employ the WebSockets API to get up and running quickly. However, if your application requires a non-standard custom solution, then you should use the WebTransport API.\n\n## Interfaces\n[`WebSocket`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket)\n\nThe primary interface for connecting to a WebSocket server and then sending and receiving data on the connection.\n\n[`WebSocketStream`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocketStream) Non-standard\n\nPromise-based interface for connecting to a WebSocket server; uses streams to send and receive data on the connection.\n\n[`CloseEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CloseEvent)\n\nThe event sent by the WebSocket object when the connection closes.\n\n[`MessageEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MessageEvent)\n\nThe event sent by the WebSocket object when a message is received from the server.\n\n## Related HTTP headers\nThe HTTP headers are used in the WebSocket handshake:\n\n[`Sec-WebSocket-Key`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Sec-WebSocket-Key)\n\nAn HTTP request header that contains a nonce from the client. This is used in the WebSocket opening handshake to verify that the client explicitly intends to open a WebSocket. It is added automatically by the browser.\n\n[`Sec-WebSocket-Accept`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Sec-WebSocket-Accept)\n\nAn HTTP response header used in the WebSocket opening handshake to indicate that the server is willing to upgrade to a WebSocket connection. The value in the directive is calculated from the value of `Sec-WebSocket-Key` in the corresponding request.\n\n[`Sec-WebSocket-Version`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Sec-WebSocket-Version)\n\nAn HTTP header that in requests indicates the version of the WebSocket protocol understood by the client. In responses, it is sent only if the requested protocol version is not supported by the server, and lists the versions that the server supports.\n\n[`Sec-WebSocket-Protocol`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Sec-WebSocket-Protocol)\n\nAn HTTP header that in requests indicates the sub-protocols supported by the client in preferred order. In responses, it indicates the sub-protocol selected by the server from the client's preferences.\n\n[`Sec-WebSocket-Extensions`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Sec-WebSocket-Extensions)\n\nAn HTTP header that in requests indicates the WebSocket extensions supported by the client in preferred order. In responses, it indicates the extension selected by the server from the client's preferences.\n\n## Guides\n- [Writing WebSocket client applications](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API/Writing_WebSocket_client_applications)\n- [Writing WebSocket servers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API/Writing_WebSocket_servers)\n- [Writing a WebSocket server in C#](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API/Writing_WebSocket_server)\n- [Writing a WebSocket server in Java](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API/Writing_a_WebSocket_server_in_Java)\n- [Writing a WebSocket server in JavaScript (Deno)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API/Writing_a_WebSocket_server_in_JavaScript_Deno)\n- [Using WebSocketStream to write a client](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API/Using_WebSocketStream)\n\n## Tools\n- [AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/): A specification for describing event-driven architectures based on protocols like WebSocket.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Audio for Web Games\"?\n\nAssistant: This article provides a detailed guide to implementing audio for web games, looking at what works currently across as wide a range of platforms as possible.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Mobile audio caveats\nBy far the most difficult platforms to provide web audio support for are mobile platforms. Unfortunately these are also the platforms that people often use to play games. There are a couple of differences between desktop and mobile browsers that may have caused browser vendors to make choices that can make web audio difficult for game developers to work with. Let's look at these now.\n\n## Autoplay\nBrowser autoplay policy now affects desktop _and_ mobile browsers. There is further information about it [here from the Google Developers site](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/autoplay/).\n\nIt is worth noting that autoplay with sound is allowed if:\n\n- the User has interacted with the domain.\n- on mobile the user has [made the application installable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Guides/Making_PWAs_installable).\n\nMany browsers will ignore any requests made by your game to automatically play audio; instead playback for audio needs to be started by a user-initiated event, such as a click or tap. This means you will have to structure your audio playback to take account of that. This is usually mitigated against by loading the audio in advance and priming it on a user-initiated event.\n\nFor more passive audio autoplay, for example background music that starts as soon as a game loads, one trick is to detect _any_ user initiated event and start playback then. For other more active sounds that are to be used during the game we could consider priming them as soon as something like a _Start_ button is pressed.\n\nTo prime audio like this we want to play a part of it; for this reason it is useful to include a moment of silence at the end of your audio sample. Jumping to, playing, and then pausing that silence will mean we can now use JavaScript to play that file at arbitrary points. You can find out more about [best practices with the autoplay policy here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Best_practices#autoplay_policy).\n\n**Note:**\nPlaying part of your file at zero volume could also work if the browser allows you to change volume (see below). Also note that playing and immediately pausing your audio does not guarantee that a small piece of audio won't be played.\n\n**Note:**\nAdding a web app to your mobile's homescreen may change its capabilities. In the case of autoplay on iOS, this appears to be the case currently. If possible, you should try your code on several devices and platforms to see how it works.\n\n## Volume\nProgrammatic volume control may be disabled in mobile browsers. The reason often given is that the user should be in control of the volume at the OS level and this shouldn't be overridden.\n\n## Buffering and preloading\nLikely as an attempt to mitigate runaway mobile network data use, we also often find that buffering is disabled before playback has been initiated. Buffering is the process of the browser downloading the media in advance, which we often need to do to ensure smooth playback.\n\nThe [`HTMLMediaElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement) interface comes with [lots of properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement#instance_properties) to help determine whether a track is in a state to be playable.\n\n**Note:**\nIn many ways the concept of buffering is an outdated one. As long as byte-range requests are accepted (which is the default behavior), we should be able to jump to a specific point in the audio without having to download the preceding content. However, preloading is still useful — without it, there would always need to be some client-server communication required before playing can commence.\n\n## Concurrent audio playback\nA requirement of many games is the need to play more than one piece of audio at the same time; for example, there might be background music playing along with sound effects for various things happening in the game. Although the situation is soon going to get better with the adoption of the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API), the current most widely-supported method — using the vanilla [`<audio>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio) element — leads to patchy results on mobile devices.\n\n## Testing and support\nHere's a table that shows what mobile platforms support the features talked about above.\n\n| Mobile browser | Version | Concurrent play | Autoplay | Volume adjusting | Preload |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Chrome (Android) | 69+ | Y | Y | Y | Y |\n| Firefox (Android) | 62+ | Y | Y | Y | Y |\n| Edge Mobile |  | Y | Y | Y | Y |\n| Opera Mobile | 46+ | Y | Y | Y | Y |\n| Safari (iOS) | 7+ | Y/N* | N | N | Y |\n| Android Browser | 67+ | Y | Y | Y | Y |\n\nMobile support for web audio features\n\nThere's a [full compatibility chart for mobile and desktop HTMLMediaElement support here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement#browser_compatibility).\n\n**Note:**\nConcurrent audio playback is tested using our [concurrent audio test example](https://jsfiddle.net/dmkyaq0r/), where we attempt to play three pieces of audio at the same time using the standard audio API.\n\n**Note:**\nSimple autoplay functionality is tested with our [autoplay test example](https://jsfiddle.net/vpdspp2b/).\n\n**Note:**\nVolume changeability is tested with our [volume test example](https://jsfiddle.net/7ta12vw4/).\n\n## Mobile workarounds\nAlthough mobile browsers can present problems, there are ways to work around the issues detailed above.\n\n## Audio sprites\nAudio sprites borrow their name from [CSS sprites](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_images/Implementing_image_sprites_in_CSS), which is a visual technique for using CSS with a single graphic resource to break it into a series of sprites. We can apply the same principle to audio so that rather than having a bunch of small audio files that take time to load and play, we have one larger audio file containing all the smaller audio snippets we need. To play a specific sound from the file, we just use the known start and stop times for each audio sprite.\n\nThe advantage is that we can prime one piece of audio and have our sprites ready to go. To do this we can just play and instantly pause the larger piece of audio. You'll also reduce the number of server requests and save bandwidth.\n\n```javascript\nconst myAudio = document.createElement(\"audio\");\nmyAudio.src = \"my-sprite.mp3\";\nmyAudio.play();\nmyAudio.pause();\n```\n\nYou'll need to sample the current time to know when to stop. If you space your individual sounds by at least 500ms then using the `timeUpdate` event (which fires every 250ms) should be sufficient. Your files may be slightly longer than they strictly need to be, but silence compresses well.\n\n## Background music\nMusic in games can have a powerful emotional effect. You can mix and match various music samples and assuming you can control the volume of your audio element you could cross-fade different musical pieces. Using the [`playbackRate()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/playbackRate) method you can even adjust the speed of your music without affecting the pitch, to sync it up better with the action.\n\n## Web Audio API for games\nThe Web Audio API is supported across all modern desktop and mobile browsers, except for Opera Mini. With that in mind, it's an acceptable approach for many situations to use the Web Audio API (see the [Can I use Web Audio API page](https://caniuse.com/#feat=audio-api) for more on browser compatibility). The Web Audio API is an advanced audio JavaScript API that is ideal for game audio. Developers can generate audio and manipulate audio samples as well as positioning sound in 3D game space.\n\n## Background music with the Web Audio API\nAlthough we can use the `<audio>` element to deliver linear background music that doesn't change in reaction to the game environment, the Web Audio API is ideal for implementing a more dynamic musical experience. You may want music to change depending on whether you are trying to build suspense or encourage the player in some way. Music is an important part of the gaming experience and depending on the type of game you are making you may wish to invest significant effort into getting it right.\n\n## Loading your tracks\nWith the Web Audio API you can load separate tracks and loops individually using the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) or [`XMLHttpRequest`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest), which means you can load them synchronously or in parallel. Loading synchronously might mean parts of your music are ready earlier and you can start playing them while others load.\n\nEither way you may want to synchronize tracks or loops. The Web Audio API contains the notion of an internal clock that starts ticking the moment you create an audio context. You'll need to take account of the time between creating an audio context and when the first audio track starts playing. Recording this offset and querying the playing track's current time gives you enough information to synchronize separate pieces of audio.\n\n## Positional audio\nPositional audio can be an important technique in making audio a key part of an immersive gaming experience. The Web Audio API not only enables us to position a number of audio sources in three-dimensional space but it can also allow us to apply filters that make that audio appear more realistic.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/Audio_for_Web_Games", "title": "Audio for Web Games", "description": "This article provides a detailed guide to implementing audio for web games, looking at what works currently across as wide a range of platforms as possible.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 13, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 00:51:55", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:description": "Audio is an important part of any game; it adds feedback and atmosphere.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"opacity\"?\n\nAssistant: The `opacity` CSS property sets the opacity of an element. Opacity is the degree to which content behind an element is hidden, and is the opposite of transparency.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Try it\n[Try it](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/opacity#try_it)\n\n## Syntax\n```css\nopacity: 0.9;\nopacity: 90%;\n\n/* Global values */\nopacity: inherit;\nopacity: initial;\nopacity: revert;\nopacity: revert-layer;\nopacity: unset;\n```\n\n## Values\n[`<alpha-value>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/opacity#alpha-value)\n\nA [`<number>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/number) in the range `0.0` to `1.0`, inclusive, or a [`<percentage>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/percentage) in the range `0%` to `100%`, inclusive, representing the opacity of the channel (that is, the value of its alpha channel). Any value outside the interval, though valid, is clamped to the nearest limit in the range.\n\n| Value | Meaning |\n| --- | --- |\n| `0` | The element is fully transparent (that is, invisible). |\n| Any [`<number>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/number) strictly between `0` and `1` | The element is translucent (that is, content behind the element can be seen). |\n| `1` (default value) | The element is fully opaque (visually solid). |\n\n## Description\n`opacity` applies to the element as a whole, including its contents, even though the value is not inherited by child elements. Thus, the element and its children all have the same opacity relative to the element's background, even if they have different opacities relative to one another.\n\nTo change the opacity of a background only, use the [`background`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background) property with a [color value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value) that allows for an alpha channel. For example:\n\n```css\nbackground: rgb(0 0 0 / 40%);\n```\n\nWhen `opacity` value is set to `0`, the element and all of its children appear invisible, but they are still part of the DOM. That means they still register [pointer events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_events) and, if the elements are in a tabbing order, they do get focus. For good usability, make sure to make such elements visible when they receive user interactions or use the CSS [`pointer-events`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/pointer-events) property to disable pointer events and take the element out of the tab order by disabling with the `disabled` attribute or setting [`tab-index=\"-1\"`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/tabindex) for non-form-related interactive elements.\n\nUsing `opacity` with a value other than `1` places the element in a new [stacking context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_positioned_layout/Understanding_z-index/Stacking_context).\n\nOpacity alone should not be used to provide information to screen readers. Use the HTML [`hidden`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/hidden) attribute, CSS [`visibility`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/visibility), or CSS [`display`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display) style properties. It's best to avoid using [`aria-hidden`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-hidden) attribute, but if the element is hidden with opacity, then hide it from screen readers as well.\n\n## Transitioning opacity\nWhen [transitioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_transitions) the opacity of elements as you add them to the page when content was formerly hidden with [`visibility: hidden`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/visibility#hidden), [`display: none`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display#none), or [`content-visibility: hidden`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/content-visibility#hidden), you need to include both a [`@starting-style`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@starting-style) and [`transition-behaviour: allow-discrete`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition-behavior#allow-discrete):\n\n```css\n.card {\n  transition:\n    opacity 5s,\n    display 5s;\n  background-color: orange;\n\n  transition-behavior: allow-discrete;\n  @starting-style {\n    opacity: 0;\n  }\n}\n\n.card.hidden {\n  display: none;\n  opacity: 0;\n}\n```\n\nTo enable first-style transitions, `@starting-style` rules are needed. In the above code, setting `opacity: 0` in `@starting-style` provides a starting point for the transition when the element receives its initial style update. For more details, see [`@starting-style`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@starting-style).\n\nSetting `transition-behavior: allow-discrete` is required to transition to `display: none`. See the [`transition-behavior`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition-behavior) property for more details.\n\n## Accessibility\nIf text opacity is adjusted, it is important to ensure that the contrast ratio between the color of the text and the background the text is placed over is high enough that people experiencing low vision conditions will be able to read the content of the page.\n\nColor contrast ratio is determined by comparing the luminosity of the opacity-adjusted text and background color values. In order to meet current [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/), a ratio of 4.5:1 is required for text content and 3:1 for larger text such as headings. Large text is defined as 18.66px and [bold](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-weight) or larger, or 24px or larger.\n\n- [WebAIM: Color Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)\n- [MDN Understanding WCAG, Guideline 1.4 explanations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Understanding_WCAG/Perceivable#guideline_1.4_make_it_easier_for_users_to_see_and_hear_content_including_separating_foreground_from_background)\n- [Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.3 | W3C Understanding WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html)\n\nVarious operating systems provide a preference for reducing transparency. To set the `opacity` based on the user's operating systems transparency preferences, use the [`prefers-reduced-transparency`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-transparency) media query.\n\n## Formal definition\n| [Initial value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/initial_value) | `1` |\n| Applies to | all elements |\n| [Inherited](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/Inheritance) | no |\n| Percentages | map to the range `[0,1]` |\n| [Computed value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/computed_value) | The same as the specified value after clipping the [`<number>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/number) to the range \\[0.0, 1.0\\]. |\n| [Animation type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animated_properties) | by computed value type |\n\n## Formal syntax\n```\nopacity =\n  <opacity-value>\n\n<opacity-value> =\n  <number>      |\n  <percentage>\n```\n\n## Examples\n### Setting opacity\nThe following example demonstrates how the `opacity` property changes the opacity of the entire element and content, thus making the text very hard to read.\n\n#### HTML\n```html\n<div class=\"light\">You can barely see this.</div>\n<div class=\"medium\">This is easier to see.</div>\n<div class=\"heavy\">This is very easy to see.</div>\n```\n\n#### CSS\n```css\ndiv {\n  background-color: yellow;\n  font-weight: bold;\n  font-size: 130%;\n}\n.light {\n  opacity: 0.2; /* Barely see the text over the background */\n}\n.medium {\n  opacity: 0.5; /* See the text more clearly over the background */\n}\n.heavy {\n  opacity: 0.9; /* See the text very clearly over the background */\n}\n```\n\n#### Result\n\n### Setting opacity on hover\nIn the following example opacity is changed on hover, so the striped background image on the parent element shows through the image.\n\n#### HTML\n```html\n<div class=\"wrapper\">\n  <img\n    src=\"//interactive-examples.mdn.mozilla.net/media/dino.svg\"\n    alt=\"MDN Dino\"\n    width=\"128\"\n    height=\"146\"\n    class=\"opacity\" />\n</div>\n```\n\n#### CSS\n```css\nimg.opacity {\n  opacity: 1;\n}\n\nimg.opacity:hover {\n  opacity: 0.5;\n}\n\n.wrapper {\n  width: 200px;\n  height: 160px;\n  background-color: #f03cc3;\n  background-image: linear-gradient(\n    90deg,\n    transparent 50%,\n    rgb(255 255 255 / 50%) 50%\n  );\n  background-size: 20px 20px;\n}\n```\n\n#### Result\n\n### Styling based on user preferences\nTo style elements based on user's operating systems transparency preferences, use the [`prefers-reduced-transparency`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/opacity#styling_based_on_user_preferences) media query.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Block-level content\"?\n\nAssistant: In CSS, content that participates in block layout is called block-level content.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Introduction\nIn a block layout, boxes are laid out one after the other, vertically, beginning at the top of a containing block. Each box's left outer edge touches the left edge of the containing block.\n\nA block-level element always starts on a new line. In horizontal writing modes, like English or Arabic, it occupies the entire horizontal space of its parent element (container) and vertical space equal to the height of its contents, thereby creating a \"block\".\n\n**Note:**\nThe above behavior of block layout changes if the containing block's [`writing-mode`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/writing-mode) is set to value other than [the default value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/writing-mode#formal_definition).\n\n**Note:**\nHTML ( _HyperText Markup Language_) elements historically were categorized as either \"block-level\" elements or \"inline\" elements. As a presentational characteristic, this is now specified by CSS.\n\n## Examples\nIn this example, two paragraph ( [`<p>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p)) elements are put in a [`<div>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div).\n\n```html\n<div>\n  <p>\n    This the first paragraph. The background color of these paragraphs have been\n    colored to distinguish them from their parent element.\n  </p>\n  <p>This is the second paragraph.</p>\n</div>\n```\n\nThe paragraph( [`<p>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p)) elements are block-level by default. That is why they are displayed in block layout:\n\n```css\np {\n  background-color: #8abb55;\n}\n```\n\n## See also\n- Related glossary terms:\n  - [Inline-level content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Inline-level_content)\n- [Block formatting context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_display/Block_formatting_context)\n- [`display`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display)\n- [`writing-mode`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/writing-mode)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Block-level_content", "title": "Block-level content", "description": "In CSS, content that participates in block layout is called block-level content.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 3, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 00:53:54", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Block-level_content", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:type": "website", "og:locale": "en_US", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:image:type": "image/png", "og:image:height": "1080", "og:image:width": "1920", "language": "en-US", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "position": ["1", "2"], "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Block-level_content", "ogDescription": "In CSS, content that participates in block layout is called block-level content.", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "og:description": "In CSS, content that participates in block layout is called block-level content.", "ogLocale": "en_US", "title": "Block-level content - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og:title": "Block-level content - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "ogTitle": "Block-level content - MDN Web Docs Glossary: Definitions of Web-related terms | MDN", "description": "In CSS, content that participates in block layout is called block-level content.", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "scrapeId": "fab682b6-3a15-4fe9-8776-110383df4f70", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Block-level_content", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Block-level_content", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Date and time formats\"?\n\nAssistant: Certain HTML elements use date and/or time values. The formats of the strings that specify these values are described in this article.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Examples\nBefore getting into the intricacies of how date and time strings are written and parsed in HTML, here are some examples that should give you a good idea what the more commonly-used date and time string formats look like.\n\n| String | Date and/or time |\n| --- | --- |\n| `2005-06-07` | June 7, 2005 | [details](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Date_and_time_formats#date_strings) |\n| `08:45` | 8:45 AM | [details](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Date_and_time_formats#time_strings) |\n| `08:45:25` | 8:45 AM and 25 seconds | [details](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Date_and_time_formats#time_strings) |\n| `0033-08-04T03:40` | 3:40 AM on August 4, 33 | [details](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Date_and_time_formats#local_date_and_time_strings) |\n| `1977-04-01T14:00:30` | 30 seconds after 2:00 PM on April 1, 1977 | [details](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Date_and_time_formats#local_date_and_time_strings) |\n| `1901-01-01T00:00Z` | Midnight UTC on January 1, 1901 | [details](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Date_and_time_formats#global_date_and_time_strings) |\n| `1901-01-01T00:00:01-04:00` | 1 second past midnight Eastern Standard Time (EST) on January 1, 1901 | [details](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Date_and_time_formats#global_date_and_time_strings) |\n\n## Basics\nBefore looking at the various formats of date and time related strings used by HTML elements, it is helpful to understand a few fundamental facts about the way they're defined. HTML uses a variation of the [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) standard for its date and time strings. It's worth reviewing the descriptions of the formats you're using in order to ensure that your strings are in fact compatible with HTML, as the HTML specification includes algorithms for parsing these strings that is actually more precise than ISO 8601, so there can be subtle differences in how date and time strings are expected to look.\n\n## Character set\nDates and times in HTML are always strings which use the [ASCII](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/ASCII) character set.\n\n## Year numbers\nIn order to simplify the basic format used for date strings in HTML, the specification requires that all years be given using the modern (or **proleptic**) [Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar). While user interfaces may allow entry of dates using other calendars, the underlying value always uses the Gregorian calendar.\n\nWhile the Gregorian calendar wasn't created until the year 1582 (replacing the similar Julian calendar), for HTML's purposes, the Gregorian calendar is extended back to the year 1 C.E. Make sure any older dates account for this.\n\nFor the purposes of HTML dates, years are always at least four digits long; years prior to the year 1000 are padded with leading zeroes ( `0`), so the year 72 is written as `0072`. Years prior to the year 1 C.E. are not supported, so HTML doesn't support years 1 B.C.E. (1 B.C.) or earlier.\n\n## Leap years\nA **leap year** is any year which is divisible by 400 _or_ the year is divisible by 4 but not by 100. Although the calendar year is normally 365 days long, it actually takes the planet Earth approximately 365.2422 days to complete a single orbit around the sun. Leap years help to adjust the calendar to keep it synchronized with the actual position of the planet in its orbit. Adding a day to the year every four years essentially makes the average year 365.25 days long, which is close to correct.\n\n## Months of the year\nThere are 12 months in the year, numbered 1 through 12. They are always represented by a two-digit ASCII string whose value ranges from `01` through `12`. See the table in the section [Days of the month](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Date_and_time_formats#days_of_the_month) for the month numbers and their corresponding names (and lengths in days).\n\n## Days of the month\nMonth numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12 are 31 days long. Months 4, 6, 9, and 11 are 30 days long. Month 2, February, is 28 days long most years, but is 29 days long in leap years. This is detailed in the following table.\n\n| Month number | Name (English) | Length in days |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 01 | January | 31 |\n| 02 | February | 28 (29 in leap years) |\n| 03 | March | 31 |\n| 04 | April | 30 |\n| 05 | May | 31 |\n| 06 | June | 30 |\n| 07 | July | 31 |\n| 08 | August | 31 |\n| 09 | September | 30 |\n| 10 | October | 31 |\n| 11 | November | 30 |\n| 12 | December | 31 |\n\n## Week strings\nA week string specifies a week within a particular year. A **valid week string** consists of a valid [year number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Date_and_time_formats#year_numbers), followed by a hyphen character ( `-`, or U+002D), then the capital letter `W` (U+0057), followed by a two-digit week of the year value.\n\nThe week of the year is a two-digit string between `01` and `53`. Each week begins on Monday and ends on Sunday. That means it's possible for the first few days of January to be considered part of the previous week-year, and for the last few days of December to be considered part of the following week-year. The first week of the year is the week that contains the _first Thursday of the year_. For example, the first Thursday of 1953 was on January 1, so that week—beginning on Monday, December 29—is considered the first week of the year. Therefore, December 30, 1952 occurs during the week `1953-W01`.\n\n## Month strings\nA month string represents a specific month in time, rather than a generic month of the year. That is, rather than representing \"January,\" an HTML month string represents a month and year paired, like \"January 1972.\"\n\nA **valid month string** consists of a valid [year number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Date_and_time_formats#year_numbers) (a string of at least four digits), followed by a hyphen character ( `-`, or U+002D), followed by a two-digit numeric [month number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Date_and_time_formats#months_of_the_year), where `01` represents January and `12` represents December.\n\n## Date strings\nA valid date string consists of a [month string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Date_and_time_formats#month_strings), followed by a hyphen character ( `-`, or U+002D), followed by a two-digit [day of the month](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Date_and_time_formats#days_of_the_month).\n\n## Time strings\nA time string can specify a time with precision to the minute, second, or to the millisecond. Specifying only the hour or minute isn't permitted. A **valid time string** minimally consists of a two-digit hour followed by a colon ( `:`, U+003A), then a two-digit minute. The minute may optionally be followed by another colon and a two-digit number of seconds. Milliseconds may be specified, optionally, by adding a decimal point character ( `.`, U+002E) followed by one, two, or three digits.\n\n## Local date and time strings\nA valid [`datetime-local`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/datetime-local) string consists of a `date` string and a `time` string concatenated together with either the letter `T` or a space character separating them. No information about the time zone is included in the string; the date and time is presumed to be in the user's local time zone.\n\n## Global date and time strings\nA global date and time string specifies a date and time as well as the time zone in which it occurs. A **valid global date and time string** is the same format as a [local date and time string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Date_and_time_formats#local_date_and_time_strings), except it has a time zone string appended to the end, following the time.\n\n## Date issues\nBecause of data storage and precision issues, you may want to be aware of a few client-side and server-side issues.\n\n## The Y2K38 Problem (often server-side)\nJavaScript uses double precision floating points to store dates, as with all numbers, meaning that JavaScript code will not suffer from the Y2K38 problem unless integer coercion/bit-hacks are used because all JavaScript bit operators use 32-bit signed 2s-complement integers.\n\n## The Y10k Problem (often client-side)\nIn many servers, dates are stored as numbers instead of as strings--numbers of a fixed size and agnostic of format (aside from endianness). After the year 10,000, those numbers will just be a bit bigger than before, so many servers will not see issues with forms submitted after the year 10,000.\n\n## See also\n- [`<input>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input)\n- [`<ins>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ins) and [`<del>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/del): see the `datetime` attribute, which specifies either a date or a local date and time at which the content was inserted or deleted\n- [The ISO 8601 specification](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html)\n- [Representing dates & times](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Representing_dates_times) in the [JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide)\n- The JavaScript [`Date`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) object\n- The [`Intl.DateTimeFormat`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat) object for formatting dates and times for a given locale.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Date_and_time_formats", "title": "Date and time formats", "description": "Certain HTML elements use date and/or time values.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Media Capabilities API\"?\n\nAssistant: The Media Capabilities API allows developers to determine decoding and encoding abilities of the device, exposing information such as whether media is supported and whether playback should be smooth and power efficient, with real time feedback about playback to better enable adaptive streaming, and access to display property information.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Concepts\nThere are a myriad of video and audio codecs. Different browsers support different media types and new media types are always being developed. With the Media Capabilities API, developers can ensure each user is getting the best bitrate and storage savings for their browser, device, and OS capabilities.\n\nWhether a device uses hardware or software decoding impacts how smooth and power efficient the video decoding is and how efficient the playback will be. The Media Capabilities API enables determining which codecs are supported and how performant a media file will be both in terms of smoothness and power efficiency.\n\nThe Media Capabilities API provide more powerful features than say `MediaRecorder.isTypeSupported()` or `HTMLMediaElement.canPlayType()`, which only address general browser support, not performance. The API also provides abilities to access display property information such as supported color gamut, dynamic range abilities, and real-time feedback about the playback.\n\nTo test support, smoothness, and power efficiency for encoding and decoding video or audio content, you use the `MediaCapabilities` interface's `encodingInfo()` and `decodingInfo()` methods.\n\nMedia capabilities information enables websites to enable adaptive streaming to alter the quality of content based on actual user-perceived quality, and react to a pick of CPU/GPU usage in real time.\n\n## Interfaces\n`MediaCapabilities`\n\nProvides information about the decoding abilities of the device, system and browser based on codecs, profile, resolution, and bitrates. The information can be used to serve optimal media streams to the user and determine if playback should be smooth and power efficient.\n\n### Extensions to other interfaces\n\n`Navigator.mediaCapabilities` Read only\n\nA `MediaCapabilities` object that can expose information about the decoding and encoding capabilities for a given media format and output capabilities.\n\n`WorkerNavigator.mediaCapabilities` Read only\n\nA `MediaCapabilities` object that can expose information about the decoding and encoding capabilities for a given media format and output capabilities.\n\n## Examples\n### Detect audio file support and expected performance\n\nThis example defines an audio configuration then checks to see if the user agent supports decoding that media configuration, and whether it will perform well in terms of smoothness and power efficiency.\n\n```javascript\nif (\"mediaCapabilities\" in navigator) {\n  const audioFileConfiguration = {\n    type: \"file\",\n    audio: {\n      contentType: \"audio/mp3\",\n      channels: 2,\n      bitrate: 132700,\n      samplerate: 5200,\n    },\n  };\n\n  navigator.mediaCapabilities\n    .decodingInfo(audioFileConfiguration)\n    .then((result) => {\n      console.log(\n        `This configuration is ${result.supported ? \"\" : \"not \" }supported,`,\n      );\n      console.log(`${result.smooth ? \"\" : \"not \" }smooth, and`);\n      console.log(`${result.powerEfficient ? \"\" : \"not \" }power efficient.`);\n    })\n    .catch(() => {\n      console.log(`decodingInfo error: ${contentType}`);\n    });\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Media_Capabilities_API", "title": "Media Capabilities API", "description": "The Media Capabilities API allows developers to determine decoding and encoding abilities of the device, exposing information such as whether media is supported and whether playback should be smooth and power efficient, with real time feedback about playback to better enable adaptive streaming, and access to display property information.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 3, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 00:58:22", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "og:type": "website", "og:image:width": "1920", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "language": "en-US", "og:image:height": "1080", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "ogDescription": "The Media Capabilities API allows developers to determine decoding and encoding abilities of the device, exposing information such as whether media is supported and whether playback should be smooth and power efficient, with real time feedback about playback to better enable adaptive streaming, and access to display property information.", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "og:locale": "en_US", "position": ["1", "2", "3"], "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Media_Capabilities_API", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "title": "Media Capabilities API - Web APIs | MDN", "ogTitle": "Media Capabilities API - Web APIs | MDN", "description": "The Media Capabilities API allows developers to determine decoding and encoding abilities of the device, exposing information such as whether media is supported and whether playback should be smooth and power efficient, with real time feedback about playback to better enable adaptive streaming, and access to display property information.", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Media_Capabilities_API", "og:description": "The Media Capabilities API allows developers to determine decoding and encoding abilities of the device, exposing information such as whether media is supported and whether playback should be smooth and power efficient, with real time feedback about playback to better enable adaptive streaming, and access to display property information.", "og:image:type": "image/png", "ogLocale": "en_US", "og:title": "Media Capabilities API - Web APIs | MDN", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "scrapeId": "1a184f94-df6d-403a-91d9-a97409cd8fa7", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Media_Capabilities_API", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Media_Capabilities_API", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Event\"?\n\nAssistant: The Event interface represents an event which takes place on an EventTarget.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Overview\nThe Event interface represents an event which takes place on an EventTarget. An event can be triggered by the user action e.g. clicking the mouse button or tapping keyboard, or generated by APIs to represent the progress of an asynchronous task. It can also be triggered programmatically, such as by calling the HTMLElement.click() method of an element, or by defining the event, then sending it to a specified target using EventTarget.dispatchEvent(). There are many types of events, some of which use other interfaces based on the main Event interface. Event itself contains the properties and methods which are common to all events. Many DOM elements can be set up to accept (or \"listen\" for) these events, and execute code in response to process (or \"handle\") them. Event-handlers are usually connected (or \"attached\") to various HTML elements (such as <button>, <div>, <span>, etc.) using EventTarget.addEventListener(), and this generally replaces using the old HTML event handler attributes. Further, when properly added, such handlers can also be disconnected if needed using removeEventListener(). One element can have several such handlers, even for the exact same event—particularly if separate, independent code modules attach them, each for its own independent purposes. (For example, a webpage with an advertising-module and statistics-module both monitoring video-watching.) When there are many nested elements, each with its own handler(s), event processing can become very complicated—especially where a parent element receives the very same event as its child elements because \"spatially\" they overlap so the event technically occurs in both, and the processing order of such events depends on the Event bubbling settings of each handler triggered.\n\n## Interfaces based on Event\nBelow is a list of interfaces which are based on the main Event interface, with links to their respective documentation in the MDN API reference. Note that all event interfaces have names which end in \"Event\".\n\n- AnimationEvent\n- AudioProcessingEvent (Deprecated)\n- BeforeUnloadEvent\n- BlobEvent\n- ClipboardEvent\n- CloseEvent\n- CompositionEvent\n- CustomEvent\n- DeviceMotionEvent\n- DeviceOrientationEvent\n- DragEvent\n- ErrorEvent\n- FetchEvent\n- FocusEvent\n- FontFaceSetLoadEvent\n- FormDataEvent\n- GamepadEvent\n- HashChangeEvent\n- HIDInputReportEvent\n- IDBVersionChangeEvent\n- InputEvent\n- KeyboardEvent\n- MediaStreamEvent (Deprecated)\n- MessageEvent\n- MouseEvent\n- MutationEvent (Deprecated)\n- OfflineAudioCompletionEvent\n- PageTransitionEvent\n- PaymentRequestUpdateEvent\n- PointerEvent\n- PopStateEvent\n- ProgressEvent\n- RTCDataChannelEvent\n- RTCPeerConnectionIceEvent\n- StorageEvent\n- SubmitEvent\n- SVGEvent (Deprecated)\n- TimeEvent\n- TouchEvent\n- TrackEvent\n- TransitionEvent\n- UIEvent\n- WebGLContextEvent\n- WheelEvent\n\n## Constructor\nEvent() creates an Event object, returning it to the caller.\n\n## Instance properties\n- Event.bubbles: A boolean value indicating whether or not the event bubbles up through the DOM.\n- Event.cancelable: A boolean value indicating whether the event is cancelable.\n- Event.composed: A boolean indicating whether or not the event can bubble across the boundary between the shadow DOM and the regular DOM.\n- Event.currentTarget: A reference to the currently registered target for the event.\n- Event.defaultPrevented: Indicates whether or not the call to event.preventDefault() canceled the event.\n- Event.eventPhase: Indicates which phase of the event flow is being processed.\n- Event.isTrusted: Indicates whether or not the event was initiated by the browser or by a script.\n- Event.target: A reference to the object to which the event was originally dispatched.\n- Event.timeStamp: The time at which the event was created (in milliseconds).\n- Event.type: The name identifying the type of the event.\n\n## Legacy and non-standard properties\n- Event.cancelBubble (Deprecated): A historical alias to Event.stopPropagation().\n- Event.explicitOriginalTarget (Non-standard): The explicit original target of the event.\n- Event.originalTarget (Non-standard): The original target of the event, before any retargetings.\n- Event.returnValue (Deprecated): A historical property still supported in order to ensure existing sites continue to work.\n- Event.scoped (Deprecated): A boolean value indicating whether the given event will bubble across through the shadow root into the standard DOM.\n\n## Instance methods\n- Event.composedPath(): Returns the event's path (an array of objects on which listeners will be invoked).\n- Event.preventDefault(): Cancels the event (if it is cancelable).\n- Event.stopImmediatePropagation(): For this particular event, prevent all other listeners from being called.\n- Event.stopPropagation(): Stops the propagation of events further along in the DOM.\n\n## Deprecated methods\n- Event.initEvent() (Deprecated): Initializes the value of an Event created.\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [DOM# interface-event](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-event) |\n\n## Browser compatibility\n\n\n## See also\n- Types of events available: Event reference\n- Learn: Introduction to events\n- Learn: Event bubbling\n- Creating and triggering custom events\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event", "title": "Event", "description": "The Event interface represents an event which takes place on an EventTarget.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 10, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 00:59:11", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"title": "Event -

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Lazy loading\"?\n\nAssistant: Lazy loading is a strategy to identify resources as non-blocking (non-critical) and load these only when needed, which translates into reduced page load times.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Overview\nAs the web has evolved, we have come to see huge increases in the number and size of assets sent to users. Between 2011 and 2019, the median resource weight increased from ~100KB to ~400KB for desktop and ~50KB to ~350KB for mobile. While Image size has increased from ~250KB to ~900KB on desktop and ~100KB to ~850KB on mobile.\n\nOne of the methods we can use to tackle this problem is to shorten the Critical Rendering Path length by lazy loading resources that are not critical for the first render to happen. A practical example would be when you land on the home page of an e-commerce site with a link to a cart page/section, and none of the cart page's resources (such as JavaScript, CSS, and images) are downloaded until you navigate there.\n\n## Strategies\nLazy loading can be applied to multiple resources and through multiple strategies.\n\n## General\nJavaScript, CSS and HTML can be split into smaller chunks. This enables sending the minimal code required to provide value upfront, improving page-load times. The rest can be loaded on demand.\n\n- Entry point splitting: separates code by entry point(s) in the app\n- Dynamic splitting: separates code where dynamic import() expressions are used\n\n## JavaScript\nAny script tag with type=\"module\" is treated as a JavaScript module and is deferred by default.\n\n## CSS\nBy default, CSS is treated as a render blocking resource, so the browser won't render any processed content until the CSSOM is constructed. CSS must be thin, delivered as quickly as possible, and the usage media types and queries are advised to unblock rendering.\n\n## Fonts\nBy default, font requests are delayed until the render tree is constructed, which can result in delayed text rendering.\n\nIt is possible to override the default behavior and preload web font resources using <link rel=\"preload\">, the CSS font-display descriptor, and the Font Loading API.\n\n## Images and iframes\nVery often, webpages contain many images that contribute to data-usage and how fast a page can load. Most of those images are off-screen, requiring a user interaction, like scrolling, in order to view them.\n\n## Loading attribute\nThe loading attribute on an <img> element, or the loading attribute on an <iframe> element, can be used to instruct the browser to defer loading of images/iframes that are off-screen until the user scrolls near them. This allows non-critical resources to load only if needed, potentially speeding up initial page loads and reducing network usage.\n\n## Intersection Observer API\nIntersection Observers allow the user to know when an observed element enters or exits the browser's viewport.\n\n## Event handlers\nWhen browser compatibility is crucial, there are a few options:\n\n- polyfill intersection observer\n- fallback to scroll, resize or orientation change event handlers to determine if a specific element is in viewport\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| HTML# lazy-loading-attributes |\n\n## See also\n- Render blocking CSS\n- Browser-level image lazy loading for the web\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Lazy_loading", "title": "Lazy loading", "description": "Lazy loading is a strategy to identify resources as non-blocking (non-critical) and load these only when needed, which translates into reduced page load times.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 12, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 01:00:16", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:type": "website", "description": "Lazy loading is a strategy to identify resources as non-blocking (non-critical) and load these only when needed.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"IdleDetector\"?\n\nAssistant: The IdleDetector interface of the Idle Detection API provides methods and events for detecting user activity on a device or screen.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Secure context\nThis feature is available only in secure contexts (HTTPS), in some or all supporting browsers.\n\n## Experimental\nThis is an experimental technology. Check the Browser compatibility table carefully before using this in production.\n\n## Note\nThis feature is available in Dedicated Web Workers.\n\n## Constructor\n`IdleDetector()` creates a new `IdleDetector` object.\n\n## Instance properties\n`IdleDetector.userState` Read only: Returns a string indicating whether the users has interacted with either the screen or the device within the threshold provided to `start()`, one of \"active\" or \"idle\". This attribute returns `null` before `start()` is called.\n\n`IdleDetector.screenState` Read only: Returns a string indicating whether the screen is locked, one of \"locked\" or \"unlocked\". This attribute returns `null` before `start()` is called.\n\n## Events\n`change`: Called when the value of `userState` or `screenState` has changed.\n\n## Static methods\n`IdleDetector.requestPermission()`: Returns a `Promise` that resolves when the user has chosen whether to grant the origin access to their idle state. Resolves with \"granted\" on acceptance and \"denied\" on refusal.\n\n## Instance methods\n`IdleDetector.start()`: Returns a `Promise` that resolves when the detector starts listening for changes in the user's idle state. `userState` and `screenState` are given initial values. This method takes an optional `options` object with the `threshold` in milliseconds where inactivity should be reported and `signal` for an `AbortSignal` to abort the idle detector.\n\n## Examples\nThe following example shows creating a detector and logging changes to the user's idle state. A button is used to get the necessary user activation before requesting permission.\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [Idle Detection API# api-idledetector](https://wicg.github.io/idle-detection/#api-idledetector) |\n\n## Browser compatibility\n|  | desktop | mobile |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Chrome | Edge | Firefox | Opera | Safari | Chrome Android | Firefox for Android | Opera Android | Safari on iOS | Samsung Internet | WebView Android | WebView on iOS |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `IdleDetector` Experimental | Chrome – Full support<br>Chrome94<br>Toggle history | Edge – Full support<br>Edge114<br>more<br>Toggle history | Firefox – No support<br>FirefoxNo<br>Toggle history | Opera – Full support<br>Opera80<br>Toggle history | Safari – No support<br>SafariNo<br>Toggle history | Chrome Android – Full support<br>Chrome Android94<br>Toggle history | Firefox for Android – No support<br>Firefox for AndroidNo<br>Toggle history | Opera Android – Full support<br>Opera Android66<br>Toggle history | Safari on iOS – No support<br>Safari on iOSNo<br>Toggle history | Samsung Internet – Full support<br>Samsung Internet17.0<br>Toggle history | WebView Android – Full support<br>WebView Android94<br>Toggle history | WebView on iOS – No support<br>WebView on iOSNo<br>Toggle history |\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IdleDetector", "title": "IdleDetector", "description": "The IdleDetector interface of the Idle Detection API provides methods and events for detecting user activity on a device or screen.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 11, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 01:00:38", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"ogDescription": "The IdleDetector interface of the Idle Detection API provides methods and events for detecting user activity on a device or screen.", "ogLocale": "en_US", "language": "en-US", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "og:title": "IdleDetector - Web APIs | MDN", "position": ["1", "2", "3"], "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "og:image:width": "1920", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "ogTitle": "IdleDetector - Web APIs | MDN", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IdleDetector", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "og:image:height": "1080", "og:type": "website", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "og:description": "The IdleDetector interface of the Idle Detection API provides methods and events for detecting user activity on a device or screen.", "og:locale": "en_US", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IdleDetector", "title": "IdleDetector - Web APIs | MDN", "description": "Learn about the IdleDetector interface, including its constructor, properties, and methods, code examples, specifications, and browser compatibility.", "og:image:type": "image/png", "scrapeId": "ff78a009-2878-4b89-98f9-ed03684bb9ab", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IdleDetector", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IdleDetector", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Animation Performance and Frame Rate\"?\n\nAssistant: This page covers the performance considerations for animations on the web, including techniques, rendering processes, and best practices for maintaining a smooth frame rate.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Introduction\nAnimation on the web can be done via SVG, JavaScript, including <canvas> and WebGL, CSS animation, <video>, animated GIFs and even animated PNGs and other image types. The performance cost of animating a CSS property can vary from one property to another, and animating expensive CSS properties can result in jank as the browser struggles to hit a smooth frame rate.\n\n## Performance Concerns\nFor animated media, such as video and animated GIFs, the main performance concern is file size - downloading the file fast enough to not negatively impact performance is the greatest issue. Code based animations, be it CSS, SVG, <canvas>, WebGL or other JavaScript animations, can cause performance issues even if the bandwidth footprint is small. These animations can consume CPU and/or cause jank.\n\n## User Expectations\nUsers expect all interface interactions to be smooth and all user interfaces to be responsive. Animation can help make a site feel faster and responsive, but animations can also make a site feel slower and janky if not done correctly. Responsive user interfaces have a frame rate of 60 frames per second (fps). While it is not always possible to maintain 60fps, it is important to maintain a high and steady frame rate for all animations.\n\n## CSS Animations\nWith CSS animations you specify a number of keyframes, each of which uses CSS to define the appearance of the element at a particular stage of the animation. The browser creates the animation as a transition from each keyframe to the next. Compared with animating elements using JavaScript, CSS animations can be easier to create. They can also give better performance, as they give the browser more control over when to render frames, and to drop frames if necessary.\n\n## Rendering Waterfall\nThe process a browser uses to paint changes to a page when an element is animating CSS properties can be described as a waterfall consisting of the following steps: 1. Recalculate Style: when a property for an element changes, the browser must recalculate computed styles. 2. Layout: next, the browser uses the computed styles to figure out the position and geometry for the elements. This operation is labeled \"layout\" but is also sometimes called \"reflow\". 3. Paint: finally, the browser needs to repaint the elements to the screen. One last step is not shown in this sequence: the page may be split into layers, which are painted independently and then combined in a process called \"Composition\".\n\n## CSS Property Cost\nIn the context of the rendering waterfall, some properties are more expensive than others: Properties that affect an element's geometry or position trigger a: - style recalculation - layout - repaint For example: left, max-width, border-width, margin-left, font-size. Properties that do not affect geometry or position and are not rendered in their own layer, do not trigger a layout. They do trigger a: - style recalculation - repaint For example: color. Properties that are rendered in their own layer don't even trigger a repaint, because the update is handled in composition. These do trigger: - style recalculation For example: transform, opacity.\n\n## Developer Tools\nMost web browsers include tools to provide insight into the work the browser is doing when it animates elements of a page. Using these tools you can measure an application's animation frame rate, and diagnose performance bottlenecks if any are found.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Animation_performance_and_frame_rate", "title": "Animation Performance and Frame Rate", "description": "This page covers the performance considerations for animations on the web, including techniques, rendering processes, and best practices for maintaining a smooth frame rate.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 7, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 01:06:50", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "description": "Animation on the web can be done via SVG, JavaScript, including <canvas> and WebGL, CSS animation, <video>, animated GIFs and even animated PNGs and other image types.

For an `RTCAudioSourceStats` this will always be `audio`.\n\n## Common instance properties\nThe following properties are common to all statistics objects.\n\n`id`\n\nA string that uniquely identifies the object that is being monitored to produce this set of statistics.\n\n`timestamp`\n\nA `DOMHighResTimeStamp` object indicating the time at which the sample was taken for this statistics object.\n\n`type`\n\nA string with the value \"media-source\", indicating that the object is an instance of either `RTCAudioSourceStats` or `RTCVideoSourceStats`.\n\n## Description\nThe interface provides statistics about an audio media source attached to one or more senders.\nThe information includes the current audio level, averaged over a short (implementation dependent) duration.\n\nThe statistics also include the accumulated total energy and total sample duration, at a particular timestamp.\nThe totals can be used to determine the average audio level over the lifetime of the stats object.\nYou can calculate a root mean square (RMS) value in the same units as `audioLevel` using the following formula:\n\ntotalAudioEnergy / totalSamplesDuration\\sqrt{\\frac{totalAudioEnergy}{totalSamplesDuration}}\n\nYou can also use the accumulated totals to calculate the average audio level over an arbitrary time period.\n\nThe total audio energy of the stats object is accumulated by adding the energy of every sample over the lifetime of the stats object, while the total duration is accumulated by adding the duration of each sample.\nThe energy of each sample is determined using the following formula, where `sample_level` is the level of the sample, `max_level` is the highest-intensity encodable value, and `duration` is the duration of the sample in seconds:\n\nduration × (sample_level / max_level)²\n\nThe average audio level between any two different `getStats()` calls, over any duration, can be calculated using the following equation:\n\ntotalAudioEnergy₂ - totalAudioEnergy₁ / totalSamplesDuration₂ - totalSamplesDuration₁\\sqrt{\\frac{\\left(totalAudioEnergy\\right)_{2} - \\left(totalAudioEnergy\\right)_{1}}{\\left(totalSamplesDuration\\right)_{2} - \\left(totalSamplesDuration\\right)_{1}}\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCAudioSourceStats", "title": "RTCAudioSourceStats", "description": "The RTCAudioSourceStats dictionary of the WebRTC API provides statistics information about an audio track that is attached to one or more senders.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 4, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 01:09:01", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "description": "Learn about the RTCAudioSourceStats interface, including its properties, code examples, specifications, and browser compatibility.", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCAudioSourceStats", "og:description": "The RTCAudioSourceStats dictionary of the WebRTC API provides statistics information about an audio track (MediaStreamTrack) that is attached to one or more senders (RTCRtpSender).", "language": "en-US", "og:locale": "en_US", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "position": ["1", "2", "3"], "ogDescription": "The RTCAudioSourceStats dictionary of the WebRTC API provides statistics information about an audio track (MediaStreamTrack) that is attached to one or more senders (RTCRtpSender).", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:type": "website", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "ogLocale": "en_US", "og:image:type": "image/png", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCAudioSourceStats", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "og:image:width": "1920", "og:image:height": "1080", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "ogTitle": "RTCAudioSourceStats - Web APIs | MDN", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "title": "RTCAudioSourceStats - Web APIs | MDN", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:title": "RTCAudioSourceStats - Web APIs | MDN", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "scrapeId": "2c2b2b09-388a-4df1-b625-5fd6e9e010ba", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCAudioSourceStats", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCAudioSourceStats", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"CSS position property\"?\n\nAssistant: The `position` CSS property sets how an element is positioned in a document. The `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties determine the final location of positioned elements.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Try it\n[Try it](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position#try_it)\n\n## Syntax\n```css\nposition: static;\nposition: relative;\nposition: absolute;\nposition: fixed;\nposition: sticky;\n\n/* Global values */\nposition: inherit;\nposition: initial;\nposition: revert;\nposition: revert-layer;\nposition: unset;\n```\n\n## Values\n### static\nThe element is positioned according to the [Normal Flow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/CSS_layout/Introduction#normal_layout_flow) of the document. The `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties have no effect. This is the default value.\n\n### relative\nThe element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and then offset relative to itself based on the values of `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left`. The offset does not affect the position of any other elements.\n\n### absolute\nThe element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout. The element is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor or to the initial containing block.\n\n### fixed\nThe element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout. The element is positioned relative to the initial containing block, which is the viewport in the case of visual media.\n\n### sticky\nThe element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and then offset relative to its nearest scrolling ancestor based on the values of `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left`. The offset does not affect the position of any other elements.\n\n## Description\n### Types of positioning\n- A **positioned element** is an element whose computed `position` value is either `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, or `sticky`.\n- A **relatively positioned element** is an element whose computed `position` value is `relative`.\n- An **absolutely positioned element** is an element whose computed `position` value is `absolute` or `fixed`.\n- A **stickily positioned element** is an element whose computed `position` value is `sticky`.\n\n## Accessibility\nEnsure that elements positioned with an `absolute` or `fixed` value do not obscure other content when the page is zoomed to increase text size.\n\n## Performance & Accessibility\nScrolling elements containing `fixed` or `sticky` content can cause performance and accessibility issues. One solution is to add `will-change: transform` to the positioned elements to render the element in its own layer.\n\n## Formal definition\n| Initial value | `static` |\n| Applies to | all elements |\n| Inherited | no |\n| Computed value | as specified |\n| Animation type | discrete |\n| Creates stacking context | yes |\n\n## Formal syntax\n```css\nposition =\n  static       |\n  relative     |\n  absolute     |\n  sticky       |\n  fixed        |\n  <running()>\n\n<running()> =\n  running( <custom-ident> )\n```\n\n## Examples\n### Relative positioning\nRelatively positioned elements are offset a given amount from their normal position within the document.\n\n#### HTML\n```html\n<div class=\"box\" id=\"one\">One</div>\n<div class=\"box\" id=\"two\">Two</div>\n<div class=\"box\" id=\"three\">Three</div>\n<div class=\"box\" id=\"four\">Four</div>\n```\n\n#### CSS\n```css\n* {\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n}\n\n.box {\n  display: inline-block;\n  width: 100px;\n  height: 100px;\n  background: red;\n  color: white;\n}\n\n#two {\n  position: relative;\n  top: 20px;\n  left: 20px;\n  background: blue;\n}\n```\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [CSS Positioned Layout Module Level 3](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-position/#position-property) |\n\n## Browser compatibility\n\n\n## See also\n- [Learn CSS: Positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/CSS_layout/Positioning)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position", "title": "CSS position property", "description": "The `position` CSS property sets how an element is positioned in a document.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Attribution Reporting API\"?\n\nAssistant: The Attribution Reporting API enables developers to measure conversions without relying on third-party tracking cookies.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Concepts and usage\nAdvertisers commonly want to measure how many users see an ad and then go on to view and purchase a product (conversions). This allows them to figure out what advertising placements are giving them the greatest return on investment (ROI) so they can adjust their advertising strategy accordingly. The process of measuring conversions usually includes capturing data such as:\n\n- Which users converted (for example purchased an item, or signed up for a service), and how many.\n- The geographic regions they are based in.\n- What sites the ads were placed on.\n- How many products were sold, services were signed up for, etc.\n- How much revenue was generated.\n\nTraditionally on the web, conversion has been measured using third-party tracking cookies. An ad will typically be embedded on a web page in an `<iframe>`, which can set a cookie containing information about the user and their interaction with the ad.\n\nLater on, when the user decides to visit the advertiser's site, provided it is from the same domain as the ad, that site can access the third-party cookie set previously by the ad. The advertiser can then associate the data from the ad with their own first-party data to answer questions such as \"did the user purchase a product after interacting with an ad for the product from another site?\"\n\nThis is bad for user privacy. At this point, any page from the same domain can get access to that cookie, plus information from sites that embed those pages. A surprisingly large number of parties will be able to access that data, and infer other data about the user based on their browsing habits.\n\nThe Attribution Reporting API provides a way to measure ad conversions in a way that protects user privacy.\n\n## How does it work?\nLet's illustrate how the Attribution Reporting API works via an example.\n\nSay we have a online shop, `shop.example` (aka the advertiser), which embeds an ad for one of its products on a content site, `news.example` (aka the publisher). The ad content is found at `ad.shop.example`.\n\nThe online shop owners want to measure how many conversions they get from users interacting with the ad, viewing the product page on their site, and putting the product into their shopping cart.\n\nThe steps involved are as follows:\n\n1. When a user visits the `news.example` site, an **attribution source** can be registered for specific user interactions with the embedded ad. There are several ways that a user can interact with ads on the page. For an ad interaction to register an attribution source, the ad must send a request with an [`Attribution-Reporting-Eligible`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Attribution-Reporting-Eligible) header to indicate that the response is eligible to register an attribution source. Registration will be completed if the response includes an appropriate [`Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source) header. The attribution source can be, for example:\n   - A link. In this case, the interaction is the user clicking on the link (directly via an [`<a>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) element, or via a [`Window.open()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/open) call). The source is registered via the response to the navigation request.\n   - An image such as an advertising banner or a 1x1 transparent tracking pixel. In this case, the interaction is the user visiting the page. The source is registered when the image loads, i.e. when the server responds to the image request.\n   - A fetch request (i.e. a [`fetch()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/fetch \"fetch()\") or [`XMLHttpRequest`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest)). In this case the interaction can be specified as whatever makes sense for your app — for example the fetch request could be invoked by a `click` or `submit` event. The source is registered once the response comes back.\n2. When the attribution source interaction occurs, the source data returned in the [`Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source) header is stored in a private local cache accessible only by the browser. This data includes the contextual and first-party data available to the page and the advertiser, the origin of the ad tech company that is collecting the conversion data, and one or more destinations ( [eTLD+1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/eTLD) s) where you expect the conversion from that ad to occur (i.e. the advertiser's site(s), for example `shop.example`).\n3. When the user later visits `shop.example`, this site can register an **attribution trigger** when an interaction indicates that a conversion has occurred (for example, the user clicks the \"Add to cart\" button on `shop.example`). The browser will then send a request along with an [`Attribution-Reporting-Eligible`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Attribution-Reporting-Eligible) header to indicate that the response is eligible to register an attribution trigger, and registration will be completed if the response includes an appropriate [`Attribution-Reporting-Register-Trigger`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Attribution-Reporting-Register-Trigger) header. The attribution trigger can be, for example:\n   - An image such as a shopping cart icon or a 1x1 transparent tracking pixel. In this case, the interaction is the user visiting the page. The trigger is registered when the image loads, i.e. when the server responds to the image request.\n   - A fetch request (i.e. a [`fetch()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/fetch \"fetch()\") or [`XMLHttpRequest`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest)). In this case the interaction can be specified as whatever makes sense for your app — for example the fetch request could be invoked by a `click` or `submit` event. The trigger is registered once the response comes back.\n4. When the trigger attribution completes, the browser attempts to match the data from the [Attribution-Reporting-Register-Trigger](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Attribution-Reporting-Register-Trigger) header with a source data entry saved in the private local cache (see 2.). See [Registering attribution triggers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Attribution_Reporting_API/Registering_triggers) for matching methodology and requirements.\n5. If a match is made, the browser sends report data to an endpoint on a reporting server typically owned by the ad tech provider where it can be securely analyzed. Unlike with cookies, the data is only available to the specific site you send it to - there will be no data shared elsewhere. These reports can be either:\n   - **Event-level reports**: Reports based on an attribution source event, where detailed source data is associated with coarse trigger data. For example, a report may look like \"Click ID 200498 on `ad.shop.example` led to a purchase on `shop.example`\", where \"Click ID 200498\" is the detailed source data, and \"purchase\" is the coarse trigger data. The detailed source data may encode first-party or contextual data from the source page, and the trigger data may encode the event from the trigger page.\n   - **Summary reports**: More detailed reports that combine data from multiple conversions on both the source and trigger side. For example \"Campaign ID 774653 on `news.example` has led to 654 sales of widgets on `shop.example` from users in Italy, with a total revenue of $9540.\" Compiling a summary report requires usage of an aggregation service (see for example the [Google aggregation service](https://github.com/privacysandbox/aggregation-service)).\n\nFor more information on implementing the functionality required for the above steps, see:\n\n1.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"XRSystem\"?\n\nAssistant: The WebXR Device API interface `XRSystem` provides methods which let you get access to an `XRSession` object representing a WebXR session. With that `XRSession` in hand, you can use it to interact with the Augmented Reality (AR) or Virtual Reality (VR) device.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Secure context\nThis feature is available only in secure contexts (HTTPS), in some or all supporting browsers.\n\n## Experimental\nThis is an experimental technology. Check the Browser compatibility table carefully before using this in production.\n\n## Instance properties\nWhile `XRSystem` directly offers no properties, it does inherit properties from its parent interface, `EventTarget`.\n\n## Instance methods\nIn addition to inheriting methods from its parent interface, `EventTarget`, the `XRSystem` interface includes the following methods:\n\n- `isSessionSupported()`: Returns a promise which resolves to `true` if the browser supports the given session mode. Resolves to `false` if the specified mode isn't supported.\n- `requestSession()`: Returns a promise that resolves to a new `XRSession` with the specified session mode.\n\n## Events\n`devicechange`: Sent when the set of available XR devices has changed. Also available using the `ondevicechange` event handler.\n\n## Usage notes\nThis interface was previously known as `XR` in earlier versions of the specification; if you see references to `XR` in code or documentation, replace that with `XRSystem`.\n\n## Examples\nThe following example shows how to use both `isSessionSupported()` and `requestSession()`.\n\n```javascript\nif (navigator.xr) {\n  immersiveButton.addEventListener(\"click\", onButtonClicked);\n  navigator.xr.isSessionSupported(\"immersive-vr\").then((isSupported) => {\n    immersiveButton.disabled = !isSupported;\n  });\n}\n\nfunction onButtonClicked() {\n  if (!xrSession) {\n    navigator.xr.requestSession(\"immersive-vr\").then((session) => {\n      onSessionStarted(session);\n    });\n  } else {\n    xrSession.end().then(() => {\n      onSessionEnded();\n    });\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis code starts by checking to see if WebXR is available by looking for the `navigator.xr` property. If it's found, we know WebXR is present, so we proceed by establishing a handler for the button which the user can click to toggle immersive VR mode on and off. However, we don't yet know if the desired immersive mode is available. To determine this, we call `isSessionSupported()`, passing it the desired session option before enabling the button, `immersiveButton`, which the user can then use to switch to immersive mode only if immersive VR mode is available. If immersive VR isn't available, the button is disabled to prevent its use. The `onButtonClicked()` function checks to see if there's already a session running. If there isn't, we use `requestSession()` to start one and, once the returned promise resolves, we call a function `onSessionStarted()` to set up our session for rendering and so forth. If, on the other hand, there is already an ongoing XR session, we instead call `end()` to end the current session. When the current session ends, the `end` event is sent, so set `xrSession` to `null` in its handler to record the fact that we no longer have an ongoing session. That way, if the user clicks the button again, a new session will start.\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [WebXR Device API# xrsystem-interface](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr/#xrsystem-interface) |\n\n## Browser compatibility\n|  | desktop | mobile |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Chrome | Edge | Firefox | Opera | Safari | Chrome Android | Firefox for Android | Opera Android | Safari on iOS | Samsung Internet | WebView Android | WebView on iOS |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `XRSystem` <br>Experimental | Chrome – Full support<br>Chrome79<br>Toggle history | Edge – Full support<br>Edge79<br>Toggle history | Firefox – No support<br>FirefoxNo<br>Toggle history | Opera – Full support<br>Opera66<br>Toggle history | Safari – No support<br>SafariNo<br>Toggle history | Chrome Android – Full support<br>Chrome Android79<br>Toggle history | Firefox for Android – No support<br>Firefox for AndroidNo<br>Toggle history | Opera Android – Full support<br>Opera Android57<br>Toggle history | Safari on iOS – No support<br>Safari on iOSNo<br>Toggle history | Samsung Internet – Full support<br>Samsung Internet12.0<br>Toggle history | WebView Android – No support<br>WebView AndroidNo<br>footnote<br>Toggle history | WebView on iOS – No support<br>WebView on iOSNo<br>Toggle history |\n| `devicechange` event<br>Experimental | Chrome – Full support<br>Chrome79<br>Toggle history | Edge – Full support<br>Edge79<br>Toggle history | Firefox – No support<br>FirefoxNo<br>Toggle history | Opera – Full support<br>Opera66<br>Toggle history | Safari – No support<br>SafariNo<br>Toggle history | Chrome Android – Full support<br>Chrome Android79<br>Toggle history | Firefox for Android – No support<br>Firefox for AndroidNo<br>Toggle history | Opera Android – Full support<br>Opera Android57<br>Toggle history | Safari on iOS – No support<br>Safari on iOSNo<br>Toggle history | Samsung Internet – Full support<br>Samsung Internet12.0<br>Toggle history | WebView Android – No support<br>WebView AndroidNo<br>Toggle history | WebView on iOS – No support<br>WebView on iOSNo<br>Toggle history |\n| `isSessionSupported()`<br>Experimental | Chrome – Full support<br>Chrome79<br>Toggle history | Edge – Full support<br>Edge79<br>Toggle history | Firefox – No support<br>FirefoxNo<br>Toggle history | Opera – Full support<br>Opera66<br>Toggle history | Safari – No support<br>SafariNo<br>Toggle history | Chrome Android – Full support<br>Chrome Android79<br>Toggle history | Firefox for Android – No support<br>Firefox for AndroidNo<br>Toggle history | Opera Android – Full support<br>Opera Android57<br>Toggle history | Safari on iOS – No support<br>Safari on iOSNo<br>Toggle history | Samsung Internet – Full support<br>Samsung Internet12.0<br>Toggle history | WebView Android – No support<br>WebView AndroidNo<br>Toggle history | WebView on iOS – No support<br>WebView on iOSNo<br>Toggle history |\n| `requestSession()`<br>Experimental | Chrome – Full support<br>Chrome79<br>Toggle history | Edge – Full support<br>Edge79<br>Toggle history | Firefox – No support<br>FirefoxNo<br>Toggle history | Opera – Full support<br>Opera66<br>Toggle history | Safari – No support<br>SafariNo<br>Toggle history | Chrome Android – Full support<br>Chrome Android79<br>Toggle history | Firefox for Android – No support<br>Firefox for AndroidNo<br>Toggle history | Opera Android – Full support<br>Opera Android57<br>Toggle history | Safari on iOS – No support<br>Safari on iOSNo<br>Toggle history | Samsung Internet – Full support<br>Samsung Internet12.0<br>Toggle history | WebView Android – No support<br>WebView AndroidNo<br>Toggle history | WebView on iOS – No support<br>WebView on iOSNo<br>Toggle history |\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XRSystem", "title": "XRSystem", "description": "The WebXR Device API interface `XRSystem` provides methods which let you get access to an `XRSession` object representing a WebXR session.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Microformats\"?\n\nAssistant: Microformats are standards used to embed semantics and structured data in HTML, and provide an API to be used by social web applications, search engines, aggregators, and other tools.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## How Microformats Work\nAn author of a webpage can add microformats to their HTML. For example if they wanted to identify themselves they could use an h-card such as:\n\n### HTML Example\n\n```\n<a class=\"h-card\" href=\"https://alice.example.com\">Alice Blogger</a>\n```\n\nWhen a parser encounters this data, it will know that this page contains a \"card\" which describes a person or organization named `Alice Blogger` with a URL of `https://alice.example.com/`. The parser makes this data available via APIs that can be used for different applications. For example, an application could scan a page for a h-card to use as profile information for someone who has signed up to a service.\n\nAs in this example, some markup patterns require only a single microformat root class name, which parsers use to find a few generic properties such as `name`, `url`, `photo`.\n\n## Microformats Use Cases\nMicroformats have numerous use cases. First, the Webmention standard uses microformats to provide a way in which messages and comments can be sent from one site to another. The Webmention specification defines specific attributes that sites may publish and consume to create a rich, interoperable way of publishing messages and comments. Microformats can also be used with Webmentions to enable sending social reactions such as likes, reposts, and bookmarks from one site to another.\n\nMicroformats also enable easy syndication across sites. An aggregator could parse a page with published microformats to look for information such as a post title, a post body, and the author of a post. This aggregator could then use the semantic information gathered to render a result on their site. For instance, news aggregators and community posting boards could facilitate submissions and use microformats to exact relevant content from a page. Further, a website could use microformats to send crafted requests to third-parties to publish content, such as social networks.\n\nAll major search engines support reading and interpreting microformats. Search engines benefit greatly from direct access to this structured data because it allows them to understand the information on web pages. With this information, search engines can provide more relevant results to users. Some search engines may render special snippets such as star ratings on a search result page based on the data provided in microformats.\n\nIn addition to being machine-readable, microformats are designed to be easily read by humans. This approach makes it easy for people to understand and maintain microformats data.\n\n## Microformats Prefixes\nAll microformats consist of a root, and a collection of properties. Properties are all optional and potentially multivalued - applications needing a singular value may use the first instance of a property. Hierarchical data is represented with nested microformats, typically as property values themselves.\n\nAll microformats class names use prefixes. Prefixes are **syntax independent of vocabularies**, which are developed separately.\n\n- **\"h-*\" for root class names**, e.g. \"h-card\", \"h-entry\", \"h-feed\", and many more. These top-level root classes usually indicate a type and corresponding expected vocabulary of properties. For example:\n  - [h-card](https://microformats.org/wiki/h-card) describes a person or organization\n  - [h-entry](https://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry) describes episodic or date stamped online content like a blog post\n  - [h-feed](https://microformats.org/wiki/h-feed) describes a stream or feed of posts\n  - You can find many more [vocabularies on the microformats2 wiki.](https://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2#v2_vocabularies)\n- **\"p-*\" for plain (text) properties**, e.g. \"p-name\", \"p-summary\"\n  - Generic plain text parsing, element text in general. On certain HTML elements, use special attributes first, e.g. img/alt, abbr/title.\n- **\"u-*\" for URL properties**, e.g. \"u-url\", \"u-photo\", \"u-logo\"\n  - Special parsing: element attributes a/href, img/src, object/data etc. attributes over element contents.\n- **\"dt-*\" for datetime properties**, e.g. \"dt-start\", \"dt-end\", \"dt-bday\"\n  - Special parsing: time element datetime attribute, [value-class-pattern](https://microformats.org/wiki/value-class-pattern) and separate date time value parsing for readability.\n- **\"e-*\" for element tree properties** where the entire contained element hierarchy is the value, e.g. \"e-content\". The \"e-\" prefix can also be mnemonically remembered as \"element tree\", \"embedded markup\", or \"encapsulated markup\".\n\n## Some microformats examples\n### h-card\nThe [h-card](https://microformats.org/wiki/h-card) microformat represents a person or organization.\n\nThe value of each property is defined in HTML using the class property any element can carry\n\n#### Example h-card\n\n```\n<p class=\"h-card\">\n  <img class=\"u-photo\" src=\"https://example.org/photo.png\" alt=\"\" />\n  <a class=\"p-name u-url\" href=\"https://example.org\">Joe Bloggs</a>\n  <a class=\"u-email\" href=\"mailto:jbloggs@example.com\">jbloggs@example.com</a>,\n  <span class=\"p-street-address\">17 Austerstræti</span>\n  <span class=\"p-locality\">Reykjavík</span>\n  <span class=\"p-country-name\">Iceland</span>\n</p>\n```\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| **`p-name`** | The full/formatted name of the person or organization. |\n| **`u-email`** | email address |\n| **`u-photo`** | a photo of the person or organization |\n| **`u-url`** | home page or other URL representing the person or organization |\n| **`u-uid`** | universally unique identifier, preferably canonical URL |\n| **`p-street-address`** | street number + name |\n| **`p-locality`** | city/town/village |\n| **`p-country-name`** | country name |\n\n#### Nested h-card example\n\n```\n<div class=\"h-card\">\n  <a class=\"p-name u-url\" href=\"https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/\">\n    Mitchell Baker\n  </a>\n  (<a class=\"p-org h-card\" href=\"https://mozilla.org/\">Mozilla Foundation</a>)\n</div>\n```\n\nParsed JSON:\n\n```\n{\n  \"items\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": [\"h-card\"],\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"name\": [\"Mitchell Baker\"],\n        \"url\": [\"https://blog.lizardwrangler.com/\"],\n        \"org\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"Mozilla Foundation\",\n            \"type\": [\"h-card\"],\n            \"properties\": {\n              \"name\": [\"Mozilla Foundation\"],\n              \"url\": [\"https://mozilla.org/\"]\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, a h-card is specified for both a person and the organization they represent.

Data channels come in two flavors.\n\n**Reliable channels** guarantee that messages you send arrive at the other peer and in the same order in which they're sent. This is analogous to a TCP socket.\n\n**Unreliable channels** make no such guarantees; messages aren't guaranteed to arrive in any particular order and, in fact, aren't guaranteed to arrive at all. This is analogous to a UDP socket.\n\nWe have [documentation for using WebRTC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API). This article, however, will take advantage of some libraries that can help trivialize the work, and will demonstrate ways to use abstraction to work around implementation differences between browsers. Hopefully, of course, those differences will fade away in time.\n\n## Original Document Information\n- Author(s): Alan Kligman\n- Source Article: [WebRTC Data Channels for Great Multiplayer](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/03/webrtc-data-channels-for-great-multiplayer/)\n- Other Contributors: Robert Nyman\n- Copyright Information: Alan Kligman, 2013\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/WebRTC_data_channels", "title": "WebRTC Data Channels", "description": "This article explains the WebRTC API's support for peer-to-peer data channels, detailing how to implement them in games using libraries.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": false, "section_count": 2, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 01:14:17", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/WebRTC_data_channels", "og:title": "WebRTC data channels - Game development | MDN", "og:type": "website", "og:image:type": "image/png", "og:image:width": "1920", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "position": ["1", "2", "3"], "ogDescription": "The WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communications) API is primarily known for its support for audio and video communications; however, it also offers peer-to-peer data channels.

There are several of them:\n\n- Normal flow — all elements are part of normal flow until you do something to take them out of it. Normal flow includes block layout, designed for laying out boxes such as paragraphs and inline layout, which lays out inline items such as text.\n- Table layout, designed for laying out tables.\n- Float layout, designed to cause an item to position itself left or right with the rest of the content in normal flow wrapping around it.\n- Positioned layout, designed for positioning elements without much interaction with other elements.\n- Multi-column layout, designed for laying content out in columns as in a newspaper.\n- Flexible box layout, designed for laying out complex pages that can be resized smoothly.\n- Grid layout, designed for laying out elements relative to a fixed grid.\n\n## Important Note\nNot all CSS properties apply to all layout modes. Most of them apply to one or two of them and have no effect if they are set on an element participating in another layout mode.\n\n## See Also\nCSS key concepts:\n- CSS syntax\n- At-rules\n- Comments\n- Specificity\n- Inheritance\n- Box model\n- Visual formatting models\n- Margin collapsing\n- Values\n  - Initial values\n  - Computed values\n  - Used values\n  - Actual values\n- Value definition syntax\n- Shorthand properties\n- Replaced elements\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Layout_mode", "title": "CSS Layout Modes", "description": "An overview of different CSS layout modes that determine the position and size of boxes based on their interactions.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 3, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 01:14:32", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "og:image:type": "image/png", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "ogDescription": "A CSS layout mode, sometimes called layout, is an algorithm that determines the position and size of boxes based on the way they interact with their sibling and ancestor boxes.

Most of the time the user-agent is a Web browser, but it can be anything, for example, a robot that crawls the Web to populate and maintain a search engine index.\n\nEach individual request is sent to a server, which handles it and provides an answer called the _response_. Between the client and the server there are numerous entities, collectively called [proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Proxy_server), which perform different operations and act as gateways or [caches](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Cache), for example.\n\n## Client: the user-agent\nThe _user-agent_ is any tool that acts on behalf of the user. This role is primarily performed by the Web browser, but it may also be performed by programs used by engineers and Web developers to debug their applications.\n\nThe browser is **always** the entity initiating the request. It is never the server (though some mechanisms have been added over the years to simulate server-initiated messages).\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview", "title": "Overview of HTTP", "description": "This page provides a comprehensive overview of the HTTP protocol, its components, and how it functions in web communication.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 2, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 01:14:48", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"ogLocale": "en_US", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "position": ["1", "2", "3"], "og:image:type": "image/png", "og:title": "An overview of HTTP - HTTP | MDN", "title": "An overview of HTTP - HTTP | MDN", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "ogDescription": "HTTP is a protocol for fetching resources such as HTML documents.\nIt is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser.\nA complete document is typically constructed from resources such as text content, layout instructions, images, videos, scripts, and more.", "language": "en-US", "description": "HTTP is a protocol for fetching resources such as HTML documents.\nIt is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser.\nA complete document is typically constructed from resources such as text content, layout instructions, images, videos, scripts, and more.", "og:locale": "en_US", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "og:image:height": "1080", "og:image:width": "1920", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "og:type": "website", "ogTitle": "An overview of HTTP - HTTP | MDN", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "og:description": "HTTP is a protocol for fetching resources such as HTML documents.\nIt is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser.\nA complete document is typically constructed from resources such as text content, layout instructions, images, videos, scripts, and more.", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "scrapeId": "7394e636-052e-4229-9fa3-a670e5d721d9", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"WebAssembly JavaScript Interface\"?\n\nAssistant: The WebAssembly JavaScript object acts as the namespace for all WebAssembly-related functionality.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Description\nThe primary uses for the WebAssembly object are:\n\n- Loading WebAssembly code, using the WebAssembly.instantiate() function.\n- Creating new memory and table instances via the WebAssembly.Memory()/ WebAssembly.Table() constructors.\n- Providing facilities to handle errors that occur in WebAssembly via the WebAssembly.CompileError()/ WebAssembly.LinkError()/ WebAssembly.RuntimeError() constructors.\n\n## Interfaces\nWebAssembly.CompileError\n\nIndicates an error during WebAssembly decoding or validation.\n\nWebAssembly.Global\n\nRepresents a global variable instance, accessible from both JavaScript and importable/exportable across one or more WebAssembly.Module instances. This allows dynamic linking of multiple modules.\n\nWebAssembly.Instance\n\nIs a stateful, executable instance of a WebAssembly.Module\n\nWebAssembly.LinkError\n\nIndicates an error during module instantiation (besides traps from the start function).\n\nWebAssembly.Memory\n\nAn object whose buffer property is a resizable ArrayBuffer that holds the raw bytes of memory accessed by a WebAssembly Instance.\n\nWebAssembly.Module\n\nContains stateless WebAssembly code that has already been compiled by the browser and can be efficiently shared with Workers, and instantiated multiple times.\n\nWebAssembly.RuntimeError\n\nError type that is thrown whenever WebAssembly specifies a trap.\n\nWebAssembly.Table\n\nAn array-like structure representing a WebAssembly Table, which stores references, such as function references.\n\nWebAssembly.Tag\n\nAn object that represents a type of WebAssembly exception.\n\nWebAssembly.Exception\n\nA WebAssembly exception object that can be thrown, caught, and rethrown both within and across WebAssembly/JavaScript boundaries.\n\n## Static methods\nWebAssembly.compile()\n\nCompiles a WebAssembly.Module from WebAssembly binary code, leaving instantiation as a separate step.\n\nWebAssembly.compileStreaming()\n\ncompiles a WebAssembly.Module directly from a streamed underlying source, leaving instantiation as a separate step.\n\nWebAssembly.instantiate()\n\nThe primary API for compiling and instantiating WebAssembly code, returning both a Module and its first Instance.\n\nWebAssembly.instantiateStreaming()\n\nCompiles and instantiates a WebAssembly module directly from a streamed underlying source, returning both a Module and its first Instance.\n\nWebAssembly.validate()\n\nValidates a given typed array of WebAssembly binary code, returning whether the bytes are valid WebAssembly code (true) or not (false).\n\n## Examples\nStream a Wasm module then compile and instantiate it\n\nThe following example (see our instantiate-streaming.html demo on GitHub, and view it live also) directly streams a Wasm module from an underlying source then compiles and instantiates it, the promise fulfilling with a ResultObject. Because the instantiateStreaming() function accepts a promise for a Response object, you can directly pass it a fetch() call, and it will pass the response into the function when it fulfills.\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| WebAssembly JavaScript Interface# webassembly-namespace |\n\n## Browser compatibility\n\n\n## See also\n- WebAssembly overview page\n- WebAssembly concepts\n- Using the WebAssembly JavaScript API\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Reference/JavaScript_interface", "title": "WebAssembly JavaScript Interface", "description": "The WebAssembly JavaScript object acts as the namespace for all WebAssembly-related functionality.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": false, "section_count": 7, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 01:15:01", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "ogLocale": "en_US", "og:image:type": "image/png", "title": "WebAssembly - WebAssembly | MDN", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "og:title": "WebAssembly - WebAssembly | MDN", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "og:type": "website", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "og:locale": "en_US", "og:description": "The WebAssembly JavaScript object acts as the namespace for all WebAssembly-related functionality.", "og:image:width": "1920", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Reference/JavaScript_interface", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "The WebAssembly JavaScript object acts as the namespace for all WebAssembly-related functionality.", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Reference/JavaScript_interface", "og:image:height": "1080", "position": ["1", "2", "3"], "language": "en-US", "ogTitle": "WebAssembly - WebAssembly | MDN", "ogDescription": "The WebAssembly JavaScript object acts as the namespace for all WebAssembly-related functionality.", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "scrapeId": "93e158a4-dfcf-4372-b80f-bb410a3b9d5d", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Reference/JavaScript_interface", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Reference/JavaScript_interface", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"HTML Constraint Validation\"?\n\nAssistant: This page covers the mechanisms introduced in HTML5 for validating form inputs on the client side, including intrinsic and basic constraints, the validation process, and how to implement complex constraints using the Constraint Validation API.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Intrinsic and basic constraints\nIn HTML, basic constraints are declared in two ways:\n\n- By choosing the most semantically appropriate value for the `type` attribute of the `<input>` element, e.g., choosing the `email` type automatically creates a constraint that checks whether the value is a valid email address.\n- By setting values on validation-related attributes, allowing basic constraints to be described without the need for JavaScript.\n\n## Semantic input types\nThe intrinsic constraints for the `type` attribute are:\n\n| Input type | Constraint description | Associated violation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `<input type=\"URL\">` | The value must be an absolute URL, as defined in the URL Living Standard. | **[TypeMismatch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState/typeMismatch)** constraint violation |\n| `<input type=\"email\">` | The value must be a syntactically valid email address, which generally has the format `username@hostname.tld` but can also be local such as `username@hostname`. | **[TypeMismatch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState/typeMismatch)** constraint violation |\n\n## Validation-related attributes\nIn addition to the `type` attribute described above, the following attributes are used to describe basic constraints:\n\n| Attribute | Input types supporting the attribute | Possible values | Constraint description | Associated violation |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `pattern` | `text`, `search`, `url`, `tel`, `email`, `password` | A JavaScript regular expression (compiled with the `global`, `ignoreCase`, and `multiline` flags disabled) | The value must match the pattern. | [**`patternMismatch`**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState/patternMismatch) constraint violation |\n| `min` | `range`, `number` | A valid number | The value must be greater than or equal to the value. | **`rangeUnderflow`** constraint violation |\n| `max` | `range`, `number` | A valid number | The value must be less than or equal to the value | **`rangeOverflow`** constraint violation |\n| `required` | `text`, `search`, `url`, `tel`, `email`, `password`, `date`, `datetime-local`, `month`, `week`, `time`, `number`, `checkbox`, `radio`, `file`; also on the `<select>` and `<textarea>` elements | none as it is a Boolean attribute: its presence means true, its absence means false | There must be a value (if set). | **`valueMissing`** constraint violation |\n\n## Constraint validation process\nConstraint validation is done through the Constraint Validation API either on a single form element or at the form level, on the `<form>` element itself. The constraint validation is done in the following ways:\n\n- By a call to the `checkValidity()` or `reportValidity()` method of a form-associated DOM interface, which evaluates the constraints only on this element, allowing a script to get this information. The `checkValidity()` method returns a Boolean indicating whether the element's value passes its constraints. In contrast, the `reportValidity()` method reports any constraint failures to the user.\n- By a call to the `checkValidity()` or `reportValidity()` method on the `HTMLFormElement` interface.\n- By submitting the form itself.\n\n## Complex constraints using the Constraint Validation API\nUsing JavaScript and the Constraint API, it is possible to implement more complex constraints, for example, constraints combining several fields, or constraints involving complex calculations.\n\n## Visual styling of constraint validation\nApart from setting constraints, web developers want to control what messages are displayed to the users and how they are styled.\n\n## Controlling the look of elements\nThe look of elements can be controlled via CSS pseudo-classes.\n\n## Controlling the text of constraint violation\nThe following items can help with controlling the text of a constraint violation:\n- The `setCustomValidity(message)` method on various elements.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Constraint_validation", "title": "HTML Constraint Validation", "description": "This page covers the mechanisms introduced in HTML5 for validating form inputs on the client side, including intrinsic and basic constraints, the validation process, and how to implement complex constraints using the Constraint Validation API.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 8, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 01:15:54", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:image:type": "image/png", "og:image:height": "1080", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "position": ["1", "2", "3"], "ogLocale": "en_US", "ogDescription": "The creation of web forms has always been a complex task.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Writing style guide\"?\n\nAssistant: This writing style guide describes how content should be written, organized, spelled, and formatted on MDN Web Docs.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## General writing guidelines\nThe goal is to write pages that include all the information that readers may need for understanding the topic at hand.\n\nThe following subsections provide the recommendations to achieve this:\n\n- Consider your target audience\n- Consider the three Cs of writing\n- Include relevant examples\n- Provide a descriptive introduction\n- Use inclusive language\n- Write with SEO in mind\n\n## Consider your target audience\nKeep the target audience for the content you are writing in mind. For example, a page on advanced network techniques likely doesn't need to go into as much detail about basic networking concepts as the typical page on networking. Keep in mind that these are guidelines. Some of these tips may not apply in every case.\n\n## Consider the three Cs of writing\nThe three Cs of good writing are writing clearly, concisely, and consistently.\n\n- Clear: Ensure that your writing is clear and simple. In general, use active voice and unambiguous pronouns. Write short sentences, sticking to one idea per sentence. Define new terms, keeping the target audience in, before using them.\n- Concise: When writing any document, it's important to know how much to say. If you provide excessive detail, the page becomes tedious to read and it will rarely be used.\n- Consistent: Ensure you use the same verbiage consistently throughout the page and across multiple pages.\n\n## Include relevant examples\nIn general, add examples or real-life scenarios to better explain the content you are writing. This helps readers to understand conceptual and procedural information in a more tangible and practical way.\n\nYou should use examples to clarify what every parameter is used for and to clarify any edge cases that may exist.\nYou can also use examples to demonstrate solutions for common tasks and solutions to problems that may arise.\n\n## Provide a descriptive introduction\nMake sure that the opening paragraph(s) before the first heading adequately summarizes the information that the page will cover and perhaps what readers will be able to achieve after going through the content. This way a reader can determine quickly whether the page is relevant to their concerns and desired learning outputs.\n\nIn a guide or tutorial, the introductory paragraph(s) should inform the reader about the topics that will be covered as well as the prerequisite knowledge the reader is expected to have, if any. The opening paragraph should mention the technologies and/or APIs that are being documented or discussed, with links to the related information, and it should offer hints to situations in which the article's contents might be useful.\n\n## Use inclusive language\nMDN has a wide and diverse audience.\nWe strongly encourage keeping text as inclusive as possible.\nHere are some alternatives to common terms used in documentation:\n\n- Avoid using the terms master and slave and instead use main and replica.\n- Replace whitelist and blacklist with allowlist and denylist.\n- Sanity should be replaced with coherence.\n- Instead of dummy, use placeholder.\n- You should not need to use the terms crazy and insane in documentation; however, if the case arises, consider using fantastic instead.\n\nIt is best to use gender-neutral language in any writing where gender is irrelevant to the subject matter.\n\n## Write with SEO in mind\nWhile the primary goal of any writing on MDN Web Docs should always be to explain and inform about open web technology so developers can quickly learn to do what they want or to find the little details they need to know in order to perfect their code, it's important that they be able to find the material we write. We can achieve this by keeping Search Engine Optimization (SEO) in mind while writing.\n\nThis section covers the standard practices, recommendations, and requirements for content to help ensure that search engines can easily categorize and index our material to ensure that readers can easily find what they need.\n\n## Writing style\nOther than writing grammatically correct sentences in English, we recommend you follow these guidelines to keep content consistent across MDN Web Docs.\n\n## Page components\nThis section lists the guidelines to follow for different parts of each page, such as headings, notes, links, and examples.\n\n## See also\n- Guidelines for writing code examples\n- Guidelines for writing HTML code examples\n- Guidelines for writing CSS code examples\n- Guidelines for writing JavaScript code examples\n- Guidelines for writing shell prompt code examples\n\n## Further reading\nIf you have questions about usage and style not covered here, we recommend referring to the Microsoft Writing Style Guide or the Chicago Manual of Style.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Writing_style_guide", "title": "Writing style guide", "description": "This writing style guide describes how content should be written, organized, spelled, and formatted on MDN Web Docs.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 11, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 01:19:18", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Writing_style_guide", "ogDescription": "This writing style guide describes how content should be written, organized, spelled, and formatted on MDN Web Docs.", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "og:type": "website", "description": "This writing style guide describes how content should be written, organized, spelled, and formatted on MDN Web Docs.", "title": "Writing style guide - MDN Web Docs | MDN", "ogLocale": "en_US", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "og:title": "Writing style guide - MDN Web Docs | MDN", "og:locale": "en_US", "og:image:type": "image/png", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "language": "en-US", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "position": ["1", "2", "3"], "og:image:height": "1080", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Writing_style_guide", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "og:image:width": "1920", "og:description": "This writing style guide describes how content should be written, organized, spelled, and formatted on MDN Web Docs.", "ogTitle": "Writing style guide - MDN Web Docs | MDN", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "scrapeId": "40c99872-1537-4b5b-8f19-ef519d21c186", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Writing_style_guide", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Writing_style_guide", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"MediaRecorder\"?\n\nAssistant: The MediaRecorder interface of the MediaStream Recording API provides functionality to easily record media.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Constructor\nMediaRecorder() Creates a new MediaRecorder object, given a MediaStream to record. Options are available to do things like set the container's MIME type (such as \"video/webm\" or \"video/mp4\") and the bit rates of the audio and video tracks or a single overall bit rate.\n\n## Instance properties\nMediaRecorder.mimeType Read only Returns the MIME type that was selected as the recording container for the MediaRecorder object when it was created.\n\nMediaRecorder.state Read only Returns the current state of the MediaRecorder object ( inactive, recording, or paused.)\n\nMediaRecorder.stream Read only Returns the stream that was passed into the constructor when the MediaRecorder was created.\n\nMediaRecorder.videoBitsPerSecond Read only Returns the video encoding bit rate in use. This may differ from the bit rate specified in the constructor (if it was provided).\n\nMediaRecorder.audioBitsPerSecond Read only Returns the audio encoding bit rate in use. This may differ from the bit rate specified in the constructor (if it was provided).\n\nMediaRecorder.audioBitrateMode Read onlyExperimental Returns the bitrate mode used to encode audio tracks.\n\n## Static methods\nMediaRecorder.isTypeSupported() A static method which returns a true or false value indicating if the given MIME media type is supported by the current user agent.\n\n## Instance methods\nMediaRecorder.pause() Pauses the recording of media.\n\nMediaRecorder.requestData() Requests a Blob containing the saved data received thus far (or since the last time requestData() was called. After calling this method, recording continues, but in a new Blob.\n\nMediaRecorder.resume() Resumes recording of media after having been paused.\n\nMediaRecorder.start() Begins recording media; this method can optionally be passed a timeslice argument with a value in milliseconds. If this is specified, the media will be captured in separate chunks of that duration, rather than the default behavior of recording the media in a single large chunk.\n\nMediaRecorder.stop() Stops recording, at which point a dataavailable event containing the final Blob of saved data is fired. No more recording occurs.\n\n## Events\nListen to these events using addEventListener() or by assigning an event listener to the oneventname property of this interface.\n\ndataavailable Fires periodically each time timeslice milliseconds of media have been recorded (or when the entire media has been recorded, if timeslice wasn't specified).

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"View Transition API\"?\n\nAssistant: The View Transition API provides a mechanism for easily creating animated transitions between different website views.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Concepts and usage\nView transitions are a popular design choice for reducing users' cognitive load, helping them stay in context, and reducing perceived loading latency as they move between states or views of an application.\n\nHowever, creating view transitions on the web has historically been difficult:\n\n- Transitions between states in single-page apps (SPAs) tend to involve writing significant CSS and JavaScript to:\n  - Handle the loading and positioning of the old and new content.\n  - Animate the old and new states to create the transition.\n  - Stop accidental user interactions with the old content from causing problems.\n  - Remove the old content once the transition is complete.\n    Accessibility issues like loss of reading position, focus confusion, and strange live region announcement behavior can also result from having the new and old content both present in the DOM at once.\n- Cross-document view transitions (i.e. across navigations between different pages in MPAs) have historically been impossible.\n\nThe View Transition API provides an easy way of handling the required view changes and transition animations for both the above use cases.\n\nCreating a view transition that uses the browser's default transition animations is very quick to do, and there are features that allow you to both customize the transition animation and manipulate the view transition itself (for example specify circumstances under which the animation is skipped), for both SPA and MPA view transitions.\n\nSee [Using the View Transition API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API/Using) for more information.\n\n## Interfaces\n[`ViewTransition`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ViewTransition)\n\nRepresents a view transition, and provides functionality to react to the transition reaching different states (e.g. ready to run the animation, or animation finished) or skip the transition altogether.\n\n## Extensions to other interfaces\n[`Document.startViewTransition()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/startViewTransition)\n\nStarts a new same-document (SPA) view transition and returns a [`ViewTransition`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ViewTransition) object to represent it.\n\n[`PageRevealEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PageRevealEvent)\n\nThe event object for the [`pagereveal`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/pagereveal_event \"pagereveal\") event. During a cross-document navigation, it allows you to manipulate the related view transition (providing access to the relevant [`ViewTransition`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ViewTransition) object) from the document being navigated _to_, if a view transition was triggered by the navigation.\n\n[`PageSwapEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PageSwapEvent)\n\nThe event object for the [`pageswap`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/pageswap_event \"pageswap\") event. During a cross-document navigation, it allows you to manipulate the related view transition (providing access to the relevant [`ViewTransition`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ViewTransition) object) from the document being navigated _from_, if a view transition was triggered by the navigation. It also provides access to information on the navigation type and current and destination document history entries.\n\nThe [`Window`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window) [`pagereveal`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/pagereveal_event \"pagereveal\") event\n\nFired when a document is first rendered, either when loading a fresh document from the network or activating a document (either from [back/forward cache](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/bfcache) (bfcache) or [prerender](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Prerender)).\n\nThe [`Window`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window) [`pageswap`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/pageswap_event \"pageswap\") event\n\nFired when a document is about to be unloaded due to a navigation.\n\n## HTML additions\n[`<link rel=\"expect\">`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel#expect)\n\nIdentifies the most critical content in the associated document for the user's initial view of the page. Document rendering will be blocked until the critical content has been parsed, ensuring a consistent first paint — and therefore, view transition — across all supporting browsers.\n\n## CSS additions\n### [At-rules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API#at-rules)\n\n[`@view-transition`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@view-transition)\n\nIn the case of a cross-document navigation, `@view-transition` is used to opt in the current and destination documents to undergo a view transition.\n\n### [Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API#properties)\n\n[`view-transition-name`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/view-transition-name)\n\nProvides the selected element with a separate identifying name and causes it to participate in a separate view transition from the root view transition — or no view transition if the `none` value is specified.\n\n### [Pseudo-elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API#pseudo-elements)\n\n[`::view-transition`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::view-transition)\n\nThe root of the view transitions overlay, which contains all view transitions and sits over the top of all other page content.\n\n[`::view-transition-group()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::view-transition-group)\n\nThe root of a single view transition.\n\n[`::view-transition-image-pair()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::view-transition-image-pair)\n\nThe container for a view transition's old and new views — before and after the transition.\n\n[`::view-transition-old()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::view-transition-old)\n\nA static snapshot of the old view, before the transition.\n\n[`::view-transition-new()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::view-transition-new)\n\nA live representation of the new view, after the transition.\n\n## Examples\n- [Basic View Transitions SPA demo](https://mdn.github.io/dom-examples/view-transitions/spa/): A basic image gallery demo with view transitions, featuring separate animations between old and new images, and old and new captions.\n- [Basic View Transitions MPA demo](https://mdn.github.io/dom-examples/view-transitions/mpa/): A sample two-page site that demonstrates usage of cross-document (MPA) view transitions, providing a custom \"swipe up\" transition when the two pages are navigated between.\n- [HTTP 203 playlist](https://http203-playlist.netlify.app/): A video player demo app that features several different SPA view transitions, many of which are explained in [Smooth transitions with the View Transition API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/view-transitions/).\n- [List of Chrome DevRel team members](https://view-transitions.chrome.dev/profiles/mpa/): A basic team profile pages app that demonstrates how to use the [`pagereveal`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/pagereveal_event \"pagereveal\") and [`pageswap`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/pageswap_event \"pageswap\") events to customize the outgoing and inbound animations of a cross-document view transition based on the \"from\" and \"to\" URLs.\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [CSS View Transitions Module Level 1](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-view-transitions/) |\n\n## Browser compatibility\n### [api.Document.startViewTransition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API#api.document.startviewtransition)\n\n### [css.at-rules.view-transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API#css.at-rules.view-transition)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API", "title": "View Transition API", "description": "The View Transition API provides a mechanism for easily creating animated transitions between different website views.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": false, "section_count": 8, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 01:22:00", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"ogTitle": "View Transition API - Web APIs | MDN", "ogLocale": "en_US", "og:type": "website", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "ogDescription": "The View Transition API provides a mechanism for easily creating animated transitions between different website views.

Thus `sign(10%)` might return `1` or `-1`, depending on how the percentage is resolved! (Or even `0`, if it's resolved against a zero length.)\n\n```css\ndiv {\n  background-position: sign(10%);\n}\n```\n\n### Position direction\nAnother use case is to control the [`position`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position) of the element. Either a positive or a negative value.\n\n```css\ndiv {\n  position: absolute;\n  top: calc(100px * sign(var(--value)));\n}\n```\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [CSS Values and Units Module Level 4<br># sign-funcs](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values/#sign-funcs) |\n\n## Browser compatibility\n|  | desktop | mobile |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Chrome | Edge | Firefox | Opera | Safari | Chrome Android | Firefox for Android | Opera Android | Safari on iOS | Samsung Internet | WebView Android | WebView on iOS |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `sign()` | Chrome – No support<br>ChromeNo<br>footnote<br>Toggle history | Edge – No support<br>EdgeNo<br>footnote<br>Toggle history | Firefox – Full support<br>Firefox118<br>Toggle history | Opera – No support<br>OperaNo<br>footnote<br>Toggle history | Safari – Full support<br>Safari15.4<br>Toggle history | Chrome Android – No support<br>Chrome AndroidNo<br>footnote<br>Toggle history | Firefox for Android – Full support<br>Firefox for Android118<br>Toggle history | Opera Android – No support<br>Opera AndroidNo<br>footnote<br>Toggle history | Safari on iOS – Full support<br>Safari on iOS15.4<br>Toggle history | Samsung Internet – No support<br>Samsung InternetNo<br>footnote<br>Toggle history | WebView Android – No support<br>WebView AndroidNo<br>footnote<br>Toggle history | WebView on iOS – No support<br>WebView on iOSNo<br>Toggle history |\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/sign", "title": "sign()", "description": "The `sign()` CSS function contains one calculation, and returns `-1` if the numeric value of the argument is negative, `+1` if the numeric value of the argument is positive, `0⁺` if the numeric value of the argument is 0⁺, and `0⁻` if the numeric value of the argument is 0⁻.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 7, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 01:22:23", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:description": "The sign() CSS function contains one calculation, and returns -1 if the numeric value of the argument is negative, +1 if the numeric value of the argument is positive, 0⁺ if the numeric value of the argument is 0⁺, and 0⁻ if the numeric value of the argument is 0⁻.", "ogDescription": "The sign() CSS function contains one calculation, and returns -1 if the numeric value of the argument is negative, +1 if the numeric value of the argument is positive, 0⁺ if the numeric value of the argument is 0⁺, and 0⁻ if the numeric value of the argument is 0⁻.", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:image:width": "1920", "og:title": "sign() - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets | MDN", "description": "The sign() CSS function contains one calculation, and returns -1 if the numeric value of the argument is negative, +1 if the numeric value of the argument is positive, 0⁺ if the numeric value of the argument is 0⁺, and 0⁻ if the numeric value of the argument is 0⁻.", "language": "en-US", "og:image:type": "image/png", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "ogLocale": "en_US", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "title": "sign() - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets | MDN", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "ogTitle": "sign() - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets | MDN", "og:image:height": "1080", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/sign", "position": ["1", "2", "3"], "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/sign", "og:type": "website", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "og:locale": "en_US", "scrapeId": "509037a3-260d-4ad1-8149-f960abf4c071", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/sign", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/sign", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Web Components\"?\n\nAssistant: Web Components is a suite of different technologies allowing you to create reusable custom elements — with their functionality encapsulated away from the rest of your code — and utilize them in your web apps.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Concepts and usage\nAs developers, we all know that reusing code as much as possible is a good idea. This has traditionally not been so easy for custom markup structures — think of the complex HTML (and associated style and script) you've sometimes had to write to render custom UI controls, and how using them multiple times can turn your page into a mess if you are not careful.\n\nWeb Components aims to solve such problems — it consists of three main technologies, which can be used together to create versatile custom elements with encapsulated functionality that can be reused wherever you like without fear of code collisions.\n\n## Custom elements\nA set of JavaScript APIs that allow you to define custom elements and their behavior, which can then be used as desired in your user interface.\n\n## Shadow DOM\nA set of JavaScript APIs for attaching an encapsulated \"shadow\" DOM tree to an element — which is rendered separately from the main document DOM — and controlling associated functionality. In this way, you can keep an element's features private, so they can be scripted and styled without the fear of collision with other parts of the document.\n\n## HTML templates\nThe `<template>` and `<slot>` elements enable you to write markup templates that are not displayed in the rendered page. These can then be reused multiple times as the basis of a custom element's structure.\n\n## Basic approach for implementing a web component\n1. Create a class in which you specify your web component functionality, using the class syntax.\n2. Register your new custom element using the `CustomElementRegistry.define()` method, passing it the element name to be defined, the class or function in which its functionality is specified, and optionally, what element it inherits from.\n3. If required, attach a shadow DOM to the custom element using `Element.attachShadow()` method. Add child elements, event listeners, etc., to the shadow DOM using regular DOM methods.\n4. If required, define an HTML template using `<template>` and `<slot>`. Again use regular DOM methods to clone the template and attach it to your shadow DOM.\n5. Use your custom element wherever you like on your page, just like you would any regular HTML element.\n\n## Guides\n[Using custom elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_custom_elements)\n\nA guide showing how to use the features of custom elements to create simple web components, as well as looking into lifecycle callbacks and some other more advanced features.\n\n[Using shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_shadow_DOM)\n\nA guide that looks at shadow DOM fundamentals, showing how to attach a shadow DOM to an element, add to the shadow DOM tree, style it, and more.\n\n[Using templates and slots](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_templates_and_slots)\n\nA guide showing how to define a reusable HTML structure using `<template>` and `<slot>` elements, and then use that structure inside your web components.\n\n## Reference\n### Custom elements\n\n`CustomElementRegistry`\n\nContains functionality related to custom elements, most notably the `CustomElementRegistry.define()` method used to register new custom elements so they can then be used in your document.\n\n`Window.customElements`\n\nReturns a reference to the `CustomElementRegistry` object.\n\n### Life cycle callbacks\n\nSpecial callback functions defined inside the custom element's class definition, which affect its behavior:\n\n`connectedCallback()`\n\nInvoked when the custom element is first connected to the document's DOM.\n\n`disconnectedCallback()`\n\nInvoked when the custom element is disconnected from the document's DOM.\n\n`adoptedCallback()`\n\nInvoked when the custom element is moved to a new document.\n\n`attributeChangedCallback()`\n\nInvoked when one of the custom element's attributes is added, removed, or changed.\n\n## Examples\nWe are building up a number of examples in our web-components-examples GitHub repo. More will be added as time goes on.\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [HTML<br>\\# the-template-element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#the-template-element) |\n| [DOM<br>\\# interface-shadowroot](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-shadowroot) |\n\n## Browser compatibility\n### html.elements.template\n\n### api.ShadowRoot\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components", "title": "Web Components", "description": "Web Components is a suite of different technologies allowing you to create reusable custom elements — with their functionality encapsulated away from the rest of your code — and utilize them in your web apps.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 10, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 01:23:51", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "og:image:width": "1920", "og:image:height": "1080", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components", "og:description": "Web Components is a suite of different technologies allowing you to create reusable custom elements — with their functionality encapsulated away from the rest of your code — and utilize them in your web apps.", "og:image:type": "image/png", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "ogDescription": "Web Components is a suite of different technologies allowing you to create reusable custom elements — with their functionality encapsulated away from the rest of your code — and utilize them in your web apps.", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "title": "Web Components - Web APIs | MDN", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "ogTitle": "Web Components - Web APIs | MDN", "og:type": "website", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "position": ["1", "2", "3"], "language": "en-US", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components", "description": "Web Components is a suite of different technologies allowing you to create reusable custom elements — with their functionality encapsulated away from the rest of your code — and utilize them in your web apps.", "ogLocale": "en_US", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:title": "Web Components - Web APIs | MDN", "og:locale": "en_US", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "scrapeId": "96fbc30a-2aa6-46c1-bf18-6dbf6204d449", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Range requests\"?\n\nAssistant: An HTTP Range request asks the server to send parts of a resource back to a client. Range requests are useful for various clients, including media players that support random access, data tools that require only part of a large file, and download managers that let users pause and resume a download.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Checking if a server supports partial requests\nIf an HTTP response includes the `Accept-Ranges` header with any value other than `none`, the server supports range requests. If responses omit the `Accept-Ranges` header, it indicates the server doesn't support partial requests. If range requests are not supported, applications can adapt to this condition; for instance, download managers can disable pause buttons that relied on range requests to resume a download.\n\nTo check if a server supports range requests, you can issue a `HEAD` request to inspect headers without requesting the resource in full. If you use curl, you can use the `-I` flag to make a `HEAD` request:\n\n```bash\ncurl -I https://i.imgur.com/z4d4kWk.jpg\n```\n\nThis will produce the following HTTP request:\n\n```http\nHEAD /z4d4kWk.jpg HTTP/2\n```\n\nThe response only contains headers and doesn't include a response body:\n\n```http\nHTTP/2 200\n…\n```\n\nIn this response, `Accept-Ranges: bytes` indicates that 'bytes' can be used as units to define a range (currently, no other unit is possible). The `Content-Length` header is also helpful as it indicates the total size of the image if you were to make the same request using the `GET` method instead.\n\n## Requesting a specific range from a server\nIf the server supports range requests, you can specify which part (or parts) of the document you want the server to return by including the `Range` header in a HTTP request.\n\n## Single part ranges\nWe can request a single range from a resource using curl for illustration. The `-H` option appends a header line to the request, which in this case is the `Range` header requesting the first 1024 bytes. The last option is `--output -` which will allow printing the binary output to the terminal:\n\n```bash\ncurl https://i.imgur.com/z4d4kWk.jpg -i -H \"Range: bytes=0-1023\" --output -\n```\n\nThe issued request looks like this:\n\n```http\nGET /z4d4kWk.jpg HTTP/2\n```\n\nThe server responds with a `206 Partial Content` status:\n\n```http\nHTTP/2 206\n…\n(binary content)\n```\n\nThe `Content-Length` header indicates the size of the requested range, not the full size of the image. The `Content-Range` response header indicates where this partial message belongs within the full resource.\n\n## Multipart ranges\nThe `Range` header also allows you to get multiple ranges at once in a multipart document. The ranges are separated by a comma.\n\n```bash\ncurl http://www.example.com -i -H \"Range: bytes=0-50, 100-150\"\n```\n\nThe server responds with the `206 Partial Content` status as shown below. The response contains a `Content-Type` header, indicating that a multipart byterange follows. The boundary string ( `3d6b6a416f9b5` in this case) separates the body parts, each of which has its own `Content-Type` and `Content-Range` fields:\n\n```http\nHTTP/1.1 206 Partial Content\n\n--3d6b6a416f9b5\n\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang=\"en-US\">\n<head>\n    <title>Example Do\n--3d6b6a416f9b5\nContent-Type: text/html\nContent-Range: bytes 100-150/1270\n\neta http-equiv=\"Content-type\" content=\"text/html; c\n--3d6b6a416f9b5--\n```\n\n## Conditional range requests\nWhen resuming to request more parts of a resource, you need to guarantee that the stored resource has not been modified since the last fragment has been received.\n\nThe `If-Range` HTTP request header makes a range request conditional: if the condition is fulfilled, the range request will be issued and the server sends back a `206 Partial Content` answer with the appropriate body. If the condition is not fulfilled, the full resource is sent back, with a `200 OK` status. This header can be used either with a `Last-Modified` validator, or with an `ETag`, but not with both.\n\n## Partial request responses\nThere are three relevant statuses, when working with range requests:\n\n- A successful range request elicits a `206 Partial Content` status from the server.\n- A range request that is out of bounds will result in a `416 Requested Range Not Satisfiable` status, meaning that none of the range values overlap the extent of the resource. For example, the first-byte-pos of every range might be greater than the resource length.\n- If range requests are not supported, an `200 OK` status is sent back and the entire response body is transmitted.\n\n## Comparison to chunked Transfer-Encoding\nThe `Transfer-Encoding` header allows chunked encoding, which is useful when larger amounts of data are sent to the client and the total size of the response is not known until the request has been fully processed. The server sends data to the client straight away without buffering the response or determining the exact length, which leads to improved latency. Range requests and chunking are compatible and can be used with or without each other.\n\n## See also\n- Related status codes `200`, `206`, `416`.\n- Related headers: `Accept-Ranges`, `Range`, `Content-Range`, `If-Range`, `Transfer-Encoding`.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Range_requests", "title": "Range requests", "description": "An HTTP Range request asks the server to send parts of a resource back to a client.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Exported Functions in WebAssembly\"?\n\nAssistant: This article describes how exported WebAssembly functions are represented in JavaScript and how to work with them.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Exported… What?\nExported WebAssembly functions are basically just JavaScript wrappers that represent WebAssembly functions in JavaScript. When you call them, you get some activity in the background to convert the arguments into types that Wasm can work with (for example converting JavaScript numbers to Int32), the arguments are passed to the function inside your Wasm module, the function is invoked, and the result is converted and passed back to JavaScript.\n\nYou can retrieve exported WebAssembly functions in two ways:\n\n- By calling [`Table.prototype.get()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Reference/JavaScript_interface/Table/get) on an existing table.\n- By accessing a function exported from a Wasm module instance via [`Instance.exports`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Reference/JavaScript_interface/Instance/exports).\n\nEither way, you get the same kind of wrapper for the underlying function. From a JavaScript point of view, it's as if every Wasm function _is_ a JavaScript function too — but they are encapsulated by the exported Wasm function object instance and there are only limited ways to access them.\n\n## An example\nLet's look at an example to clear things up (you can find this on GitHub as [table-set.html](https://github.com/mdn/webassembly-examples/blob/main/other-examples/table-set.html); see it [running live also](https://mdn.github.io/webassembly-examples/other-examples/table-set.html), and check out the Wasm [text representation](https://github.com/mdn/webassembly-examples/blob/main/js-api-examples/table.wat)):\n\n```javascript\nconst otherTable = new WebAssembly.Table({ element: \"anyfunc\", initial: 2 });\n\nWebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(fetch(\"table.wasm\")).then((obj) => {\n  const tbl = obj.instance.exports.tbl;\n  console.log(tbl.get(0)()); // 13\n  console.log(tbl.get(1)()); // 42\n  otherTable.set(0, tbl.get(0));\n  otherTable.set(1, tbl.get(1));\n  console.log(otherTable.get(0)());\n  console.log(otherTable.get(1)());\n});\n```\n\nHere we create a table ( `otherTable`) from JavaScript using the [`WebAssembly.Table`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Reference/JavaScript_interface/Table) constructor, then we load `table.wasm` into our page using the [`WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Reference/JavaScript_interface/instantiateStreaming_static) method.\n\nWe then get the function exported from the module, retrieve the functions it references via [`tbl.get()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Reference/JavaScript_interface/Table/get) and log the result of invoking each one to the console. Next, we use `set()` to make the `otherTable` table contain references to the same functions as the `tbl` table.\n\nTo prove this, we then retrieve these references back from `otherTable` and print their results to console too, which gives the same results.\n\n## They are real functions\nIn the previous example, the return value of each [`Table.prototype.get()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Reference/JavaScript_interface/Table/get) call is an exported WebAssembly function — exactly what we have been talking about.\n\nIt is worth noting that these are real JavaScript functions, in addition to being wrappers for WebAssembly functions. If you load the above example in a [WebAssembly-supporting browser](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly#browser_compatibility), and run the following lines in your console:\n\n```javascript\nconst testFunc = otherTable.get(0);\ntypeof testFunc;\n```\n\nyou'll get the result `function` returned. You can then go on to do pretty much anything to this function that you can do to other [functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function) in JavaScript — [`call()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call), [`bind()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind), etc. `testFunc.toString()` returns an interesting result:\n\n```\nfunction 0() {\n    [native code]\n}\n```\n\nThis gives you more of an idea of its wrapper-type nature.\n\nSome other particulars to be aware of with exported WebAssembly functions:\n\n- Their [length](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/length) property is the number of declared arguments in the Wasm function signature.\n- Their [name](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/name) property is the `toString()` result of the function's index in the Wasm module.\n- If you try to call an exported Wasm function that takes or returns an i64 type value, it currently throws an error because JavaScript currently has no precise way to represent an i64. The solution is to use BigInt values, which represent integers of arbitrary size, so they can represent 64-bit integers properly.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Guides/Exported_functions", "title": "Exported Functions in WebAssembly", "description": "This article describes how exported WebAssembly functions are represented in JavaScript and how to work with them.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 3, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 01:31:58", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"ogTitle": "Exported WebAssembly functions - WebAssembly | MDN", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "og:title": "Exported WebAssembly functions - WebAssembly | MDN", "ogLocale": "en_US", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "language": "en-US", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "description": "Exported WebAssembly functions are how WebAssembly functions are represented in JavaScript.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"AudioData\"?\n\nAssistant: The AudioData interface of the WebCodecs API represents an audio sample.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Description\nAn audio track consists of a stream of audio samples, each sample representing a captured moment of sound. An AudioData object is a representation of such a sample. Working alongside the interfaces of the Insertable Streams API, you can break a stream into individual AudioData objects with MediaStreamTrackProcessor, or construct an audio track from a stream of frames with MediaStreamTrackGenerator.\n\nNote: Find out more about audio on the web in Digital audio concepts.\n\n## The media resource\nAn AudioData object contains a reference to an attached media resource. This media resource contains the actual audio sample data described by the object. A media resource is maintained by the user agent until it is no longer referenced by an AudioData object, for example when AudioData.close() is called.\n\n## Planes and audio format\nTo return the sample format of an AudioData use the AudioData.format property. The format may be described as interleaved or planar. In interleaved formats, the audio samples from the different channels are laid out in a single buffer, described as a plane. This plane contains a number of elements equal to AudioData.numberOfFrames * AudioData.numberOfChannels.\n\nIn planar format, the number of planes is equal to AudioData.numberOfChannels, and each plane is a buffer containing a number of elements equal to AudioData.numberOfFrames.\n\n## Constructor\nAudioData() Creates a new AudioData object.\n\n## Instance properties\nAudioData.format Read only\nReturns the sample format of the audio.\n\nAudioData.sampleRate Read only\nReturns the sample rate of the audio in Hz.\n\nAudioData.numberOfFrames Read only\nReturns the number of frames.\n\nAudioData.numberOfChannels Read only\nReturns the number of audio channels.\n\nAudioData.duration Read only\nReturns the duration of the audio in microseconds.\n\nAudioData.timestamp Read only\nReturns the timestamp of the audio in microseconds.\n\n## Instance methods\nAudioData.allocationSize() Returns the number of bytes required to hold the sample as filtered by options passed into the method.\n\nAudioData.copyTo() Copies the samples from the specified plane of the AudioData object to the destination.\n\nAudioData.clone() Creates a new AudioData object with reference to the same media resource as the original.\n\nAudioData.close() Clears all states and releases the reference to the media resource.\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [WebCodecs# audiodata-interface](https://w3c.github.io/webcodecs/#audiodata-interface) |\n\n## Browser compatibility\n\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioData", "title": "AudioData", "description": "The AudioData interface of the WebCodecs API represents an audio sample.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 8, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 01:32:17", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:image:type": "image/png", "title": "AudioData - Web APIs | MDN", "language": "en-US", "ogTitle": "AudioData - Web APIs | MDN", "ogLocale": "en_US", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioData", "og:image:height": "1080", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "position": ["1", "2", "3"], "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "ogDescription": "The AudioData interface of the WebCodecs API represents an audio sample.", "description": "Learn about the AudioData interface, including its constructor, properties, and methods, specifications and browser compatibility.", "og:description": "The AudioData interface of the WebCodecs API represents an audio sample.", "og:image:width": "1920", "og:type": "website", "og:title": "AudioData - Web APIs | MDN", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioData", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "og:locale": "en_US", "scrapeId": "2adc35e2-106d-4966-8dc0-8a799a08f19f", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioData", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioData", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Invoker Commands API\"?\n\nAssistant: The Invoker Commands API provides a way to declaratively assign behaviors to buttons, allowing control of interactive elements when the button is enacted (clicked or invoked via a keypress, such as the spacebar or return key).\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Concepts and usage\nA common pattern on the web is to have `<button>` elements control various aspects of the page, such as opening and closing popovers or `<dialog>` elements, formatting text, and more.\n\nHistorically creating these kinds of controls has required JavaScript event listeners added to the button which can then call the APIs on the element they control. The `commandForElement` and `command` properties provide a way to do this declaratively for a limited set of actions. This can be advantageous for built-in commands as the user does not have to wait for JavaScript to download and execute to make these buttons interactive.\n\n## HTML attributes\n`commandfor`\n\nTurns a `<button>` element into a button, controlling the given interactive element; takes the ID of the element to control as its value.\n\n`command`\n\nSpecifies the action to be performed on an element being controlled by a control `<button>`, specified via the `commandfor` attribute.\n\n## Interfaces\n`CommandEvent`\n\nRepresents an event notifying the user that a command has been issued. It is the event object for the `command` event. The event fires on element referenced by `commandForElement`.\n\n## Extensions to other interfaces\n### Instance properties\n\n`HTMLButtonElement.commandForElement`\n\nGets and sets the element being controlled by the button. The JavaScript equivalent of the `commandfor` HTML attribute.\n\n`HTMLButtonElement.command`\n\nGets and sets the action to be performed on the element being controlled by the button. Reflects the value of the `command` HTML attribute.\n\n### Events\n\n`command` event\n\nFired on the element referenced by the button.\n\n## Examples\n### Creating declarative popovers\n\n```html\n<button commandfor=\"mypopover\" command=\"toggle-popover\">\n  Toggle the popover\n</button>\n<div id=\"mypopover\" popover>\n  <button commandfor=\"mypopover\" command=\"hide-popover\">Close</button>\n  Popover content\n</div>\n```\n\n### Creating declarative dialogs\n\n```html\n<button commandfor=\"mydialog\" command=\"show-modal\">Show modal dialog</button>\n<dialog id=\"mydialog\">\n  <button commandfor=\"mydialog\" command=\"close\">Close</button>\n  Dialog Content\n</dialog>\n```\n\n### Creating custom commands\n\n```html\n<button commandfor=\"my-img\" command=\"--rotate-left\">Rotate left</button>\n<button commandfor=\"my-img\" command=\"--rotate-right\">Rotate right</button>\n<img id=\"my-img\" src=\"photo.jpg\" alt=\"[add appropriate alt text here]\" />\n```\n\n```js\nconst myImg = document.getElementById(\"my-img\");\n\nmyImg.addEventListener(\"command\", (event) => {\n  if (event.command == \"--rotate-left\") {\n    myImg.style.rotate = \"-90deg\";\n  } else if (event.command == \"--rotate-right\") {\n    myImg.style.rotate = \"90deg\";\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [HTML<br>#

These can also be defined in SVG using attributes of the form data-*, where * is the key name for the pair. This works just like HTML's HTMLElement.dataset property and HTML's data-* global attribute.\n\nSVGElement.className Deprecated Read only\n\nAn SVGAnimatedString that reflects the value of the class attribute on the given element, or the empty string if class is not present.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Insecure Passwords\"?\n\nAssistant: This page discusses the dangers of serving login forms over HTTP and the importance of using HTTPS to protect user data.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Introduction\nServing login forms over HTTP is especially dangerous because of the wide variety of attacks that can be used against them to extract a user's password. Network eavesdroppers could steal a user's password by sniffing the network, or by modifying the served page in transit.\n\n## Importance of HTTPS\nThe HTTPS protocol is designed to protect user data from eavesdropping (confidentiality) and from modification (integrity) on the network. Websites that handle user data should use HTTPS to protect their users from attackers. If a website uses HTTP instead of HTTPS, it is trivial to steal user information (such as their login credentials). This was famously demonstrated by Firesheep.\n\n## Fixing the Issue\nTo fix this issue, install and configure a TLS certificate on your server. There are various vendors offering free and paid certificates. If you are using a cloud platform, it may have its own ways of enabling HTTPS.\n\n## Note on Password Reuse\nSometimes websites require username and passwords but don't actually store data that is very sensitive. For example, a news site may save which news articles a user wants to go back to and read, but not save any other data about a user. Web developers of the news site may be less motivated to secure their site and their user credentials. Unfortunately, password reuse is a big problem. Users use the same password across multiple sites (news websites, social networks, email providers, banks). Hence, even if access to the username and password to your site doesn't seem like a huge risk to you, it is a great risk to users who have used the same username and password to log in to their bank accounts. Attackers are getting smarter; they steal username/password pairs from one site and then try reusing them on more lucrative sites.\n\n## See Also\nNo More Passwords over HTTP, Please! — detailed blog post with more information, and FAQ.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Insecure_passwords", "title": "Insecure Passwords", "description": "This page discusses the dangers of serving login forms over HTTP and the importance of using HTTPS to protect user data.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 5, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 01:36:12", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:image:height": "1080", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "ogDescription": "Serving login forms over HTTP is especially dangerous because of the wide variety of attacks that can be used against them to extract a user's password.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"InputDeviceCapabilities API\"?\n\nAssistant: The InputDeviceCapabilities API provides details about the underlying sources of input events, describing how the device behaves rather than what it is.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Input device capabilities concepts and usage\nBecause DOM events abstract device input, they provide no way to learn what device or type of device fired an event. This can lead to instances where the same action triggers multiple event handlers. To deal with this, developers make assumptions and use heuristics to normalize behavior on web pages.\n\nThe InputDeviceCapabilities API addresses this problem by abstracting the capabilities of input devices. For example, let's say we have a web page that implements both a `touchstart` and a `mousedown` event. We can assume that if the touchstart event is triggered that the user's device has a touch interface. What about when the mousedown event is triggered? It would be useful to know if a `touchstart` event were also triggered so that we don't take the same action twice. We can do this by checking the sourceCapabilities property of the [`UIEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/UIEvent).\n\n## Interfaces\n[`InputDeviceCapabilities`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/InputDeviceCapabilities)Experimental\n\nProvides logical information about an input device.\n\n## Extensions to other interfaces\n[`UIEvent.sourceCapabilities`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/UIEvent/sourceCapabilities)ExperimentalRead only\n\nReturns an instance of the `InputDeviceCapabilities` interface, which provides information about the physical device responsible for generating a touch event.\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [Input Device

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Fetch API\"?\n\nAssistant: The Fetch API provides an interface for fetching resources (including across the network). It is a more powerful and flexible replacement for XMLHttpRequest.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Concepts and usage\nThe Fetch API uses Request and Response objects (and other things involved with network requests), as well as related concepts such as CORS and the HTTP Origin header semantics.\n\nFor making a request and fetching a resource, use the fetch() method. It is a global method in both Window and Worker contexts. This makes it available in pretty much any context you might want to fetch resources in.\n\nThe fetch() method takes one mandatory argument, the path to the resource you want to fetch. It returns a Promise that resolves to the Response to that request — as soon as the server responds with headers — even if the server response is an HTTP error status. You can also optionally pass in an init options object as the second argument (see Request).\n\nOnce a Response is retrieved, there are a number of methods available to define what the body content is and how it should be handled.\n\nYou can create a request and response directly using the Request() and Response() constructors, but it's uncommon to do this directly. Instead, these are more likely to be created as results of other API actions (for example, FetchEvent.respondWith() from service workers).\n\nFind out more about using the Fetch API features in Using Fetch.\n\n## Fetch Interfaces\nWindow.fetch() and WorkerGlobalScope.fetch()\n\nThe fetch() method used to fetch a resource.\n\nHeaders\n\nRepresents response/request headers, allowing you to query them and take different actions depending on the results.\n\nRequest\n\nRepresents a resource request.\n\nResponse\n\nRepresents the response to a request.\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [Fetch# fetch-method](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#fetch-method) |\n\n## Browser compatibility\n\n\n## See also\n- [Using Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)\n- [Service Worker API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API)\n- [HTTP access control (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)\n- [HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API", "title": "Fetch API", "description": "The Fetch API provides an interface for fetching resources (including across the network).

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"How browsers work\"?\n\nAssistant: This page explains how browsers work and how to improve web performance by understanding the browser's processes.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Overview\nFast sites provide better user experiences. Users want and expect web experiences with content that is fast to load and smooth to interact with.\n\nTwo major issues in web performance are issues having to do with latency and issues having to do with the fact that for the most part, browsers are single-threaded.\n\nLatency is the biggest threat to our ability to ensure a fast-loading page. It is the developers' goal to make the site load as fast as possible — or at least appear to load super fast — so the user gets the requested information as quickly as possible. Network latency is the time it takes to transmit bytes over the air to computers. Web performance is what we have to do to make the page load as quickly as possible.\n\nFor the most part, browsers are considered single-threaded. That is, they execute a task from beginning to end before taking up another task. For smooth interactions, the developer's goal is to ensure performant site interactions, from smooth scrolling to being responsive to touch. Render time is key, ensuring the main thread can complete all the work we throw at it and still always be available to handle user interactions. Web performance can be improved by understanding the single-threaded nature of the browser and minimizing the main thread's responsibilities, where possible and appropriate, to ensure rendering is smooth and responses to interactions are immediate.\n\n## Navigation\nNavigation is the first step in loading a web page. It occurs whenever a user requests a page by entering a URL into the address bar, clicking a link, submitting a form, as well as other actions.\n\nOne of the goals of web performance is to minimize the amount of time navigation takes to complete. In ideal conditions, this usually doesn't take too long, but latency and bandwidth are foes that can cause delays.\n\n## DNS lookup\nThe first step of navigating to a web page is finding where the assets for that page are located. If you navigate to https://example.com, the HTML page is located on the server with IP address of 93.184.216.34. If you've never visited this site, a DNS lookup must happen.\n\nYour browser requests a DNS lookup, which is eventually fielded by a name server, which in turn responds with an IP address. After this initial request, the IP will likely be cached for a time, which speeds up subsequent requests by retrieving the IP address from the cache instead of contacting a name server again.\n\nDNS lookups usually only need to be done once per hostname for a page load. However, DNS lookups must be done for each unique hostname the requested page references. If your fonts, images, scripts, ads, and metrics all have different hostnames, a DNS lookup will have to be made for each one.\n\n## TCP handshake\nOnce the IP address is known, the browser sets up a connection to the server via a TCP three-way handshake. This mechanism is designed so that two entities attempting to communicate — in this case the browser and web server — can negotiate the parameters of the network TCP socket connection before transmitting data, often over HTTPS.\n\nTCP's three-way handshaking technique is often referred to as \"SYN-SYN-ACK\" — or more accurately SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK — because there are three messages transmitted by TCP to negotiate and start a TCP session between two computers. Yes, this means three more messages back and forth between each server, and the request has yet to be made.\n\n## TLS negotiation\nFor secure connections established over HTTPS, another \"handshake\" is required. This handshake, or rather the TLS negotiation, determines which cipher will be used to encrypt the communication, verifies the server, and establishes that a secure connection is in place before beginning the actual transfer of data. This requires five more round trips to the server before the request for content is actually sent.\n\n## Response\nOnce we have an established connection to a web server, the browser sends an initial HTTP GET request on behalf of the user, which for websites is most often an HTML file. Once the server receives the request, it will reply with relevant response headers and the contents of the HTML.\n\n## Congestion control / TCP slow start\nTCP packets are split into segments during transmission. Because TCP guarantees the sequence of packets, the server must receive an acknowledgment from the client in the form of an ACK packet after sending a certain number of segments.\n\nIf the server waits for an ACK after each segment, that will result in frequent ACKs from the client and may increase transmission time, even in the case of a low-load network.\n\nOn the other hand, sending too many segments at once can lead to the problem that in a busy network the client will not be able to receive the segments and will just keep responding with ACKs for a long time, and the server will have to keep re-sending the segments.\n\nIn order to balance the number of transmitted segments, the TCP slow start algorithm is used to gradually increase the amount of transmitted data until the maximum network bandwidth can be determined, and to reduce the amount of transmitted data in case of high network load.\n\n## Parsing\nOnce the browser receives the first chunk of data, it can begin parsing the information received. Parsing is the step the browser takes to turn the data it receives over the network into the DOM and CSSOM, which is used by the renderer to paint a page to the screen.\n\n## Building the DOM tree\nWe describe five steps in the critical rendering path. The first step is processing the HTML markup and building the DOM tree. HTML parsing involves tokenization and tree construction. HTML tokens include start and end tags, as well as attribute names and values. If the document is well-formed, parsing it is straightforward and faster.\n\n## Preload scanner\nWhile the browser builds the DOM tree, this process occupies the main thread. As this happens, the preload scanner will parse through the content available and request high-priority resources like CSS, JavaScript, and web fonts.\n\n## Building the CSSOM tree\nThe second step in the critical rendering path is processing CSS and building the CSSOM tree. The CSS object model is similar to the DOM. The DOM and CSSOM are both trees. They are independent data structures.\n\n## Other processes\nJavaScript compilation: While the CSS is being parsed and the CSSOM created, other assets, including JavaScript files, are downloading (thanks to the preload scanner). JavaScript is parsed, compiled, and interpreted.\n\n## Render\nRendering steps include style, layout, paint, and in some cases compositing. The CSSOM and DOM trees created in the parsing step are combined into a render tree which is then used to compute the layout of every visible element, which is then painted to the screen.\n\n## Style\nThe third step in the critical rendering path is combining the DOM and CSSOM into a render tree. The computed style tree, or render tree, construction starts with the root of the DOM tree, traversing each visible node.\n\n## Layout\nThe fourth step in the critical rendering path is running layout on the render tree to compute the geometry of each node.\n\n## Paint\nThe last step in the critical rendering path is painting the individual nodes to the screen, the first occurrence of which is called the first Meaningful Paint.\n\n## Compositing\nWhen sections of the document are drawn in different layers, overlapping each other, compositing is necessary to ensure they are drawn to the screen in the right order and the content is rendered correctly.\n\n## Interactivity\nOnce the main thread is done painting the page, you would think we would be \"all set.\" That isn't necessarily the case. If the load includes JavaScript, that was correctly deferred, and only executed after the onload event fires, the main thread might be busy, and not available for scrolling, touch, and other interactions.\n\n## See also\nWeb Performance\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/How_browsers_work", "title": "How browsers work", "description": "This page explains how browsers work and how to improve web performance by understanding the browser's processes.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 19, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 01:37:39", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "ogDescription": "Users want web experiences with content that is fast to load and smooth to interact with.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Firefox Security Guidelines\"?\n\nAssistant: This document outlines a set of security guidelines that will generally apply to all client applications, such as Firefox and Thunderbird.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Purpose\nThis document outlines a set of security guidelines that will generally apply to all client applications, such as Firefox and Thunderbird.\n\n## Secure Coding Principles\nEnsure that the application follows the OWASP Secure Coding Principles:\n\n1. Minimize attack surface area\n2. Establish secure defaults\n3. Principle of Least privilege\n4. Principle of Defense in depth\n5. Fail securely\n6. Don't trust services\n7. Keep security simple\n8. Fix security issues correctly\n\n## Input Validation\n1. Does the application accept user input?\n   1. Verify a sampling of input locations to ensure that reasonable maximums are in place when accepting user data\n   2. Verify a sampling of input locations to ensure that the application allows only a defined set of acceptable characters\n   3. Ensure that allowlisting is used instead of denylisting\n2. Does the application accept user input that is displayed in any way?\n   1. Verify a sampling of input and output locations to ensure user supplied content is properly encoded in the response.\n\n## Chrome JS - Dangerous Functions\nAre any of the following functions used?\n\nIf so ensure they are safe and that no better alternatives are available.\n\n| Name | Risk Level | Problem | Solution |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| eval | Very High | Invokes JavaScript parser - dangerous if used with untrusted input | Avoid eval if at all possible. |\n| setTimeout(string, time) | Very High | Acts like eval | Use setTimeout(function, time, param1, param2, …) |\n\n## C++ - Dangerous Functions\nAre any of the following functions used?\n\nIf so ensure they are safe and that no better alternatives are available.\n\n| Name | Risk Level | Problem | Solution |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| gets | Very High | No bounds checking | Do not use gets. Use fgets instead. |\n| strcpy | Very High | No bounds checking | strcpy is safe only if the source string is a constant and the destination is large enough to hold it. Otherwise, use strncpy. |\n| sprintf | Very High | No bounds checking, format string attacks | sprintf is very hard to use safely. Use snprintf instead. |\n| scanf, sscanf | High | Possibly no bounds checking, format string attacks | Make sure all %-directives match the corresponding argument types. Do not use '%s' directives with no bounds checking. Use '%xs' where x is the buffer size of the corresponding argument. Do not use untrusted, un-validated data in the format string. |\n| strcat | High | No bounds checking | If input sizes are not well-known and fixed, use strncat instead. |\n| printf, fprintf, snprintf, vfprintf, vsprintf, syslog | High | format string attacks | Do not use untrusted, un-validated data in the format string. If the format string can be influenced by Web content or user input, validate it for the proper number and type of %-directives before calling these functions. Make sure destination size arguments are correct. |\n| strncpy, fgets, strncat | Low | May not null-terminate | Always explicitly null-terminate the destination buffer. Make sure the size argument is correct. Be sure to leave room in the destination buffer to add the null character!\n\n## URLs\n1. Does the application make use of untrusted data to construct URLs?\n   - Ensure any such data is adequately sanitized and encoded prior to use.\n   - Ensure any data obtained from these URLs is checked before use or storage.\n2. Does the application follow redirects?\n   - Ensure security checks are performed on redirects as well as the original request URI.\n\n## Security Controls\n1. Does the application implement suitable permission checks?\n   - Ensure the correct APIs are used where available (e.g. shouldLoad, etc.)\n   - Ensure the application fails securely.\n\n## Remote System Access\n1. Does the application access any remote systems?\n\n- Ensure that TLS is used unless there's a very good reason not to.\n- Ensure that no user information is transmitted without the user's consent.\n\n## Information Storage\n1. File storage\n   1. Ensure the application checks that any files created are under allowed paths\n   2. Are filenames generated from untrusted data?\n      - Ensure the data is suitably encoded\n   3. Check files are of an acceptable type\n   4. Check files cannot exceed reasonable size limits\n2. Database storage\n   1. Ensure any untrusted information sent to the database is adequately sanitized\n   2. Where possible, make use of type safe parameterization to prevent injection attacks\n3. Sensitive information\n   1. Ensure any security sensitive or personal information is adequately protected (see Encryption section)\n   2. Particular care must be taken around credentials (passwords, etc.) - If you're working with information of this type and you're unsure of what to do, it's always worth asking\n4. Logging\n   1. Don't forget the above rules apply to logs as well as your usual application data.\n\n## Encryption\n1. Does the application use any form of encryption?\n2. Are the algorithms used recognized standards?\n\n## Denial of Service\n1. Ensure the application protects against exhaustion of:\n   1. System memory\n   2. Storage\n\n## Security Warnings\n1. Does the application present the user with any security warnings?\n\n2. Are they clearly understandable and appropriate?\n\n3. Can untrusted data change the meaning of messages to the user?\n   - Can user input change the meaning of messages?\n   - Can user input force system messages off the visible screen?\n   - Can user input include special characters that can change the meaning of messages (e.g. Unicode right-to-left override U+202E)\n4. Can an attacker use the timing of dialogs to fool the user into clicking on something they didn't intend to?\n\n## Information Disclosure\n1. Does the application disclose information that could compromise the user?\n2. Does the application disclose any information that it does not need to?\n3. Does the application disclose anything that may surprise or upset the user?\n\n## Front End\n1. Are safe mechanisms used to create XUL and HTML UI elements?\n   - e.g. use createTextNode instead of innerHTML or similar\n2. Does the application create its own docshells (tabs, iframes)?\n   - Ensure you are explicit about the type of these, e.g. iframe.setAttribute(\"type\", \"content\")\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Firefox_Security_Guidelines", "title": "Firefox Security Guidelines", "description": "This document outlines a set of security guidelines that will generally apply to all client applications, such as Firefox and Thunderbird.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 14, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 01:38:30", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"language": "en-US", "ogLocale": "en_US", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "title": "Firefox security guidelines - Security on the web | MDN", "ogTitle": "Firefox security guidelines - Security on the web | MDN", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "og:description": "This document outlines a set of security guidelines that will generally apply to all client applications, such as Firefox and Thunderbird.", "ogDescription": "This document outlines a set of security guidelines that will generally apply to all client applications, such as Firefox and Thunderbird.", "og:type": "website", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:image:width": "1920", "og:locale": "en_US", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "description": "This document outlines a set of security guidelines that will generally apply to all client applications, such as Firefox and Thunderbird.", "og:image:type": "image/png", "og:title": "Firefox security guidelines - Security on the web | MDN", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "position": ["1", "2", "3"], "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Firefox_Security_Guidelines", "og:image:height": "1080", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Firefox_Security_Guidelines", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "scrapeId": "05c3468c-fd87-4086-9d19-b551725c652c", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Firefox_Security_Guidelines", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Firefox_Security_Guidelines", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Storage Access Policy\"?\n\nAssistant: Firefox includes a new storage access policy that blocks cookies and other site data from third-party tracking resources. This policy is designed as an alternative to the older cookie policies, which have been available in Firefox for many years. This policy protects against cross-site tracking while minimizing the site breakage associated with traditional cookie blocking. This article explains how the policy works and how you can test it.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Testing in Firefox\nThis cookie policy has been available in Firefox since version 63. This documentation describes the policy that we intend to ship to Firefox Release users, but may not match what is implemented in the current Release version of Firefox. That's because we document new aspects of the policy as soon as they land in Firefox Nightly, our pre-release channel. Firefox Nightly may also contain experimental features that we don't yet plan to ship to Release users; experimental features will not be included in this documentation, but may nevertheless impact the functionality of domains classified as trackers.\n\nWe recommend sites test with Firefox Nightly, as this includes the newest version of our protections. As described above, note that Nightly may include additional protections that end up getting removed or changed before they reach our Release users. We'll keep this page updated with the newest information as we strengthen our protections.\n\nThese protections are on by default in Nightly. The cookie policy can be enabled in other versions of Firefox through the Content Blocking settings (these steps will vary by version; the linked documentation includes a dropdown to select the appropriate Firefox version).\n\n## Report Broken Sites\nIf you find a website broken as a result of this change, file a bug under the Tracking Protection component within the Firefox product on Bugzilla. Alternatively you can report broken sites directly in Firefox by clicking \"Report a Problem\" in the Content Blocking section of the Control Center (this shortcut may not be available in all versions of Firefox).\n\n## Tracking protection explained\nHow does Firefox determine which resources are tracking resources?\n\nFirefox uses the Tracking Protection list to determine which resources are tracking resources. The Tracking Protection list is maintained by Disconnect. When the list is applied in Firefox, we make two important changes:\n\n- First, we only use the \"Basic Protection\" version of the list, which excludes some categories of trackers. In the future, we may expand our protections to use the \"Strict Protection\" version of the list.\n- Second, Firefox uses an additional \"entity list\", which prevents domains from being classified as trackers when they are loaded on a top-level site owned by the same organization.\n\nFirefox uses the built-in Tracking Protection URL classifier to determine which resources match the tracking protection list. Domains are matched against the list in accordance with the SafeBrowsing v4 specification. Specifically, we check the exact hostname of the resource against the list, as well as the last four hostnames formed by starting with the last five components and successively removing the leading component.\n\n## What does the storage access policy block?\nThe storage access policy blocks resources identified as trackers from accessing third-party cookies and other site storage loaded in a third-party context. This prevents those resources from retrieving tracking identifiers and using them to identify users across visits to multiple first parties. Specifically, Firefox does this by imposing the following restrictions:\n\nCookies:\n- Block Cookie request headers and ignore Set-Cookie response headers.\n- Return an empty string for calls to Document.cookie and ignore requests to set cookies via Document.cookie.\n\nDOM Storage:\n- localStorage: read and write attempts throw a SecurityError exception. Prior to Firefox 70: Window.localStorage is null. Thus, attempts to read and write using this object will throw a TypeError exception.\n- sessionStorage: read and write attempts are permitted.\n- IndexedDB: attempting to access the IndexedDB factory object throws a SecurityError exception.\n\nMessaging and Workers:\n- Broadcast Channel: attempts to create a new BroadcastChannel will throw a SecurityError exception.\n- Shared Worker: attempts to create a new SharedWorker will throw a SecurityError exception.\n- Service Worker: attempts to create a new ServiceWorker will throw a SecurityError exception.\n\nDOM Cache:\n- Calls to CacheStorage will always reject with a SecurityError.\n\nBrowser caches:\n- The HTTP cache, the Image cache, and the Alternative Services (Alt-Svc) cache are all partitioned for tracking resources, such that each top-level origin will have a separate partition and tracking resources on different top-level origins will be cached separate from each other.\n\nNetwork connections:\n- TLS sessions will not be resumed using a session ticket when an HTTPS connection is made to an embedded third-party resource that is classified as a tracker.\n- HTTP connection reuse by domains classified as trackers is limited to requests that occur under the same top-level origin.\n\nHTTP Referrers\n- The default Referrer Policy for third-party resources classified as trackers is set to strict-origin-when-cross-origin.\n\n## What is not blocked by the policy?\n1. This policy does not currently restrict third-party storage access for resources that are not classified as tracking resources. We may choose to apply additional restrictions to third-party storage access in the future.\n2. The restrictions applied by the policy will not prevent third-party scripts classified as tracking resources from accessing storage in the main context of the page. These scripts can continue to use storage scoped to the top-level origin.\n3. Origins classified as trackers will have access to their own storage when they are loaded in a first-party context.\n4. Cross-origin resources loaded from the same eTLD+1 as the top-level context will still have access to their storage.\n5. Origins normally classified as trackers will not be blocked if the top-level page origin is determined to be from the same organization as them.\n\n## Storage access grants\nIn order to improve web compatibility and permit third-party integrations that require storage access, Firefox will grant storage access scoped to the first party for a particular third-party origin as described in this section. Currently, Firefox includes some web compatibility heuristics that grant storage access to third-party resources classified as trackers when a user interacts with those third parties. We do this when we expect that not granting access would cause the web page to break. We also support an initial implementation of the Storage Access API, through which embedded <iframe>s can request storage access by calling Document.requestStorageAccess(). Although both of these approaches provide the same level of storage access, we recommend third parties switch to using the Storage Access API in order to guarantee their access to storage.\n\n## Automatic storage access upon interaction\nIn order to improve web compatibility, Firefox currently includes some heuristics to grant storage access automatically to third parties that receive user interaction. These heuristics are intended to allow some third-party integrations that are common on the web to continue to function. They are intended to be temporary and will be removed in a future version of Firefox. They should not be relied upon for current and future web development.\n\nThird-party storage access may be granted to resources that have been classified as tracking resources when a user gesture triggers a pop-up window that has opener access to the originating document. When that occurs, there are three possible ways a third-party origin can be granted access:\n- The origin of the resource that is initially loaded in the pop-up window is granted storage access on the opener document if that origin has received user interaction as a first party within the past 30 days.\n- After the initial resource is loaded in the pop-up window, the window may go through a series of redirects to other hosts. If a user interacts with the pop-up window following a redirect, the origin of the content loaded in the pop-up window is given storage access on the opener document.\n- When there is a top-level redirect from a tracking origin to a non-tracking origin, the tracking origin receives short-lived storage access on the non-tracking origin and any other non-tracking origins that appear further down the redirect chain.\n\n## Scope of storage access\nWhen storage access is granted, it is scoped to the site of the opener document or subdomains of that origin. Access that is granted on the subdomain of an origin does extend to the top-level origin. As an example, if a resource from tracker.example is granted storage access on foo.example.com, then tracker.example will be able to access its cookies on bar.foo.example.com and on example.com.\n\nWhen storage access is granted to tracker.example on example.com, all resources loaded from tracker.example on any top-level document loaded from example.com are immediately given storage access. This includes all resources loaded in the main context of the page, embedded <iframe>s, and resources loaded within embedded <iframe>s. Storage access is not extended to other resources loaded on example.com (e.g. other-tracker.example), nor to other first parties on which tracker.example is embedded (e.g. example.org).\n\n## Storage access expiration\nThe storage access grant expires after 30 days. Domains classified as tracking resources may be granted third-party storage access on multiple first parties, and the storage permission for each party expires independently. The above heuristics will also serve to extend the lifetime of a third-party storage permission on origins that have already been granted access.\n\n## Debugging\nWe encourage site owners to test their sites, particularly those that rely on third-party content integrations. We've added several new features to Firefox to make testing easier.\n\n## Developer Tools notifications\nThe Network Monitor in Firefox Developer Tools now includes an indicator for all resource requests that have been classified as tracking resources. This indicator is shown as a shield icon in the domain column.\n\n## Adding custom domains to the Tracking Protection list\nCurious how things will work if a third-party domain on your site were classified as a tracker? We've added a preference that allows you to add custom domains to the Tracking Protection URL classifier.\n\n## FAQ\nThis cookie policy has the potential to lead to site breakage, but has been designed to allow common third-party integrations to continue to work while preventing cross-site tracking. In this section we describe the functionality you can expect in different integration scenarios.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Storage_Access_Policy", "title": "Storage Access Policy", "description": "Firefox includes a new storage access policy that blocks cookies and other site data from third-party tracking resources.

Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the compatibility table at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.\n\n## Syntax\nThe <shape> data type is specified using the rect() function, which produces a region in the form of a rectangle.\n\n`rect()`\n\n```\nrect(top, right, bottom, left)\n```\n\n## Values\n_top_ is a <length> representing the offset for the top of the rectangle relative to the top border of the element's box.\n\n_right_ is a <length> representing the offset for the right of the rectangle relative to the left border of the element's box.\n\n_bottom_ is a <length> representing the offset for the bottom of the rectangle relative to the top border of the element's box.\n\n_left_ is a <length> representing the offset for the left of the rectangle relative to the left border of the element's box.\n\n## Interpolation\nWhen animated, values of the <shape> data type are interpolated over their top, right, bottom, and left components, each treated as a real, floating-point number. The speed of the interpolation is determined by the easing function associated with the animation.\n\n## Example\nExample demonstrating correct use of the rect() function:\n\n```\nimg.clip04 {\n  clip: rect(10px, 20px, 20px, 10px);\n}\n```\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [Cascading Style Sheets Level 2<br># value-def-shape](https://drafts.csswg.org/css2/#value-def-shape) |\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/shape", "title": "CSS shape", "description": "The <shape> CSS data type defines the specific form (shape) of a region, which represents the part of an element to which the clip property applies.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 6, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 01:39:39", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/shape", "ogDescription": "The <shape> CSS data type defines the specific form (shape) of a region.

This will be \"enforce\" or \"report\".  \n\n[`CSPViolationReportBody.documentURL`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSPViolationReportBody/documentURL) Read only  \nA string representing the URL of the document or worker in which the violation was found.  \n\n[`CSPViolationReportBody.effectiveDirective`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSPViolationReportBody/effectiveDirective) Read only  \nA string representing the directive whose enforcement uncovered the violation.  \n\n[`CSPViolationReportBody.lineNumber`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSPViolationReportBody/lineNumber) Read only  \nThe line number in the script at which the violation occurred.  \n\n[`CSPViolationReportBody.originalPolicy`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSPViolationReportBody/originalPolicy) Read only  \nA string containing the policy whose enforcement uncovered the violation.  \n\n[`CSPViolationReportBody.referrer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSPViolationReportBody/referrer) Read only  \nA string representing the URL for the referrer of the resources whose policy was violated, or `null`.  \n\n[`CSPViolationReportBody.sample`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSPViolationReportBody/sample) Read only  \nA string representing a sample of the resource that caused the violation, usually the first 40 characters. This will only be populated if the resource is an inline script, event handler, or style — external resources causing a violation will not generate a sample.  \n\n[`CSPViolationReportBody.sourceFile`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSPViolationReportBody/sourceFile) Read only  \nIf the violation occurred as a result of a script, this will be the URL of the script; otherwise, it will be `null`. Both `columnNumber` and `lineNumber` should have non-null values if this property is not `null`.  \n\n[`CSPViolationReportBody.statusCode`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSPViolationReportBody/statusCode) Read only  \nA number representing the HTTP status code of the document or worker in which the violation occurred.\n\n## Instance methods\n_Also inherits methods from its parent interface, [`ReportBody`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReportBody)._  \n\n[`CSPViolationReportBody.toJSON()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSPViolationReportBody/toJSON)  \nA _serializer_ which returns a JSON representation of the `CSPViolationReportBody` object.\n\n## Examples\n### [Obtaining a `CSPViolationReportBody` object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSPViolationReportBody#obtaining_a_cspviolationreportbody_object)  \nTo obtain a `CSPViolationReportBody` object, you must configure your page so that a CSP violation will occur.  \nIn this example, we will set our CSP to only allow content from the site's own origin, and then attempt to load a script from `apis.google.com`, which is an external origin.  \n\nFirst, we will set our [`Content-Security-Policy`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy) header in the HTTP response:  \n\n```http  \nContent-Security-Policy: default-src 'self';  \n```  \n\nor in the HTML [`<meta>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta) element:  \n\n```html  \n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Security-Policy\" content=\"default-src 'self'\" />  \n```  \n\nThen, we will attempt to load an external script:  \n\n```html  \n<!-- This should generate a CSP violation -->  \n<script src=\"https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js\"></script>  \n```  \n\nFinally, we will create a new [`ReportingObserver`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReportingObserver) object to listen for CSP violations (this will need to be loaded from the same location, before the script that causes the violation).  \n\n```js  \nconst observer = new ReportingObserver(  \n  (reports, observer) => {  \n    reports.forEach((violation) => {  \n      console.log(violation);  \n      console.log(JSON.stringify(violation));  \n    });  \n  },  \n  {  \n    types: [\"csp-violation\"],  \n    buffered: true,  \n  },  \n);  \n\nobserver.observe();  \n```  \n\nAbove we log the each violation report object and a JSON-string version of the object, which might look similar to the object below.  \nNote that the `body` is an instance of the `CSPViolationReportBody` and the `type` is \"csp-violation\".  \n\n```json  \n{  \n    \"type\": \"csp-violation\",  \n    \"url\": \"http://127.0.0.1:9999/\",  \n    \"body\": {  \n        \"sourceFile\": null,  \n        \"lineNumber\": null,  \n        \"columnNumber\": null,  \n        \"documentURL\": \"http://127.0.0.1:9999/\",  \n        \"referrer\": \"\",  \n        \"blockedURL\": \"https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js\",  \n        \"effectiveDirective\": \"script-src-elem\",  \n        \"originalPolicy\": \"default-src 'self';\",  \n        \"sample\": \"\",  \n        \"disposition\": \"enforce\",  \n        \"statusCode\": 200  \n    }  \n}  \n```  \n\n### [Sending a CSP violation report](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSPViolationReportBody#sending_a_csp_violation_report)  \nConfiguring a web page to send a CSP violation report is similar to the previous example.  \nAs before, you need to configure your page so that there is a violation.  \nIn addition, you also need to specify the endpoint(s) where the report will be sent.  \nA server specifies endpoints using the [`Reporting-Endpoints`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Reporting-Endpoints) response header: these must be secure URLs (HTTPS).  \nThe CSP [`report-to`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/report-to) directive is then used to specify that a particular endpoint is used for reporting CSP violations:  \n\n```http  \nReporting-Endpoints: csp-endpoint=\"https://example.com/csp-report-to\"  \nContent-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; report-to csp-endpoint  \n```  \n\nAs before, we can trigger a violation by loading an external script from a location that is not allowed by our CSP header:  \n\n```html  \n<!-- This should generate a CSP violation -->  \n<script src=\"https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js\"></script>  \n```  \n\nThe violation report will then be sent to the indicated endpoint as a JSON file.  \nAs you can see from the example below, the `type` is \"csp-violation\" and the `body` property is a serialization of the `CSPViolationReportBody` object:  \n\n```json  \n[  \n  {  \n    \"age\": 53531,  \n    \"body\": {  \n      \"blockedURL\": \"inline\",  \n      \"columnNumber\": 59,  \n      \"disposition\": \"enforce\",  \n      \"documentURL\": \"https://example.com/csp-report-to\",  \n      \"effectiveDirective\": \"script-src-elem\",  \n      \"lineNumber\": 1441,  \n      \"originalPolicy\": \"default-src 'self'; report-to csp-endpoint\",  \n      \"referrer\": \"https://www.google.com/\",  \n      \"sample\": \"\",  \n      \"sourceFile\": \"https://example.com/csp-report-to\",  \n      \"statusCode\": 200  \n    },  \n    \"type\": \"csp-violation\",  \n    \"url\": \"https://example.com/csp-report-to\",  \n    \"user_agent\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0;

For example, HTML5-compliant browsers hide content marked as `<foo hidden>…</foo>`, even though `<foo>` is not a valid HTML element.\n\n## Additional Global Attributes\nIn addition to the basic HTML global attributes, the following global attributes also exist:\n\n- `xml:lang` and `xml:base` — these are inherited from the XHTML specifications and deprecated, but kept for compatibility purposes.\n- The ARIA `role` attribute and the multiple `aria-*` states and properties, used for ensuring accessibility.\n- The event handler attributes: `onabort`, `onautocomplete`, `onautocompleteerror`, `onblur`, `oncancel`, `oncanplay`, `oncanplaythrough`, `onchange`, `onclick`, `onclose`, `oncontextmenu`, `oncuechange`, `ondblclick`, `ondrag`, `ondragend`, `ondragenter`, `ondragleave`, `ondragover`, `ondragstart`, `ondrop`, `ondurationchange`, `onemptied`, `onended`, `onerror`, `onfocus`, `oninput`, `oninvalid`, `onkeydown`, `onkeypress`, `onkeyup`, `onload`, `onloadeddata`, `onloadedmetadata`, `onloadstart`, `onmousedown`, `onmouseenter`, `onmouseleave`, `onmousemove`, `onmouseout`, `onmouseover`, `onmouseup`, `onmousewheel`, `onpause`, `onplay`, `onplaying`, `onprogress`, `onratechange`, `onreset`, `onresize`, `onscroll`, `onseeked`, `onseeking`, `onselect`, `onshow`, `onsort`, `onstalled`, `onsubmit`, `onsuspend`, `ontimeupdate`, `ontoggle`, `onvolumechange`, `onwaiting.\n\n## List of Global Attributes\nHere is a list of global attributes:\n\n- [`accesskey`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/accesskey): Provides a hint for generating a keyboard shortcut for the current element.\n- [`anchor`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/anchor): Non-standard, associates a positioned element with an anchor element.\n- [`autocapitalize`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/autocapitalize): Controls whether inputted text is automatically capitalized.\n- [`autocorrect`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/autocorrect): Controls whether input text is automatically corrected for spelling errors.\n- [`autofocus`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/autofocus): Indicates that an element is to be focused on page load.\n- [`class`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/class): A space-separated list of the classes of the element.\n- [`contenteditable`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/contenteditable): Indicates if the element should be editable by the user.\n- [`data-*`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/data-*): Custom data attributes for exchanging proprietary information.\n- [`dir`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/dir): Indicates the directionality of the element's text.\n- [`draggable`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/draggable): Indicates whether the element can be dragged.\n- [`enterkeyhint`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/enterkeyhint): Hints what action label to present for the enter key on virtual keyboards.\n- [`exportparts`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/exportparts): Used to transitively export shadow parts from a nested shadow tree.\n- [`hidden`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/hidden): Indicates that the element is not yet, or is no longer, relevant.\n- [`id`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/id): Defines a unique identifier which must be unique in the whole document.\n- [`inert`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/inert): Makes the browser disregard user input events for the element.\n- [`inputmode`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/inputmode): Provides a hint to browsers about the type of virtual keyboard configuration to use.\n- [`is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/is): Allows you to specify that a standard HTML element should behave like a registered custom built-in element.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes", "title": "Global attributes", "description": "Global attributes are attributes common to all HTML elements;

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"IDBKeyRange\"?\n\nAssistant: The IDBKeyRange interface of the IndexedDB API represents a continuous interval over some data type that is used for keys. Records can be retrieved from IDBObjectStore and IDBIndex objects using keys or a range of keys.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Introduction\nThe IDBKeyRange interface of the IndexedDB API represents a continuous interval over some data type that is used for keys. Records can be retrieved from IDBObjectStore and IDBIndex objects using keys or a range of keys. You can limit the range using lower and upper bounds. For example, you can iterate over all values of a key in the value range A–Z.\n\n## Key Range Types\nA key range can be a single value or a range with upper and lower bounds or endpoints. If the key range has both upper and lower bounds, then it is bounded; if it has no bounds, it is unbounded. A bounded key range can either be open (the endpoints are excluded) or closed (the endpoints are included). To retrieve all keys within a certain range, you can use the following code constructs:\n\n| Range | Code |\n| --- | --- |\n| All keys ≥ **x** | `IDBKeyRange.lowerBound(x)` |\n| All keys > **x** | `IDBKeyRange.lowerBound(x, true)` |\n| All keys ≤ **y** | `IDBKeyRange.upperBound(y)` |\n| All keys < **y** | `IDBKeyRange.upperBound(y, true)` |\n| All keys ≥ **x** && ≤ **y** | `IDBKeyRange.bound(x, y)` |\n| All keys > **x** &&< **y** | `IDBKeyRange.bound(x, y, true, true)` |\n| All keys > **x** && ≤ **y** | `IDBKeyRange.bound(x, y, true, false)` |\n| All keys ≥ **x** &&< **y** | `IDBKeyRange.bound(x, y, false, true)` |\n| The key = **z** | `IDBKeyRange.only(z)` |\n\n## Key Range Conditions\nA key is in a key range if the following conditions are true:\n\n- The lower value of the key range is one of the following:\n  - `undefined`\n  - Less than key value\n  - Equal to key value if `lowerOpen` is `false`.\n- The upper value of the key range is one of the following:\n  - `undefined`\n  - Greater than key value\n  - Equal to key value if `upperOpen` is `false`.\n\n## Instance properties\n[`IDBKeyRange.lower`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IDBKeyRange/lower) Read only\n\nLower bound of the key range.\n\n[`IDBKeyRange.upper`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IDBKeyRange/upper) Read only\n\nUpper bound of the key range.\n\n[`IDBKeyRange.lowerOpen`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IDBKeyRange/lowerOpen) Read only\n\nReturns false if the lower-bound value is included in the key range.\n\n[`IDBKeyRange.upperOpen`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IDBKeyRange/upperOpen) Read only\n\nReturns false if the upper-bound value is included in the key range.\n\n## Static methods\n[`IDBKeyRange.bound()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IDBKeyRange/bound_static \"IDBKeyRange.bound()\")\n\nCreates a new key range with upper and lower bounds.\n\n[`IDBKeyRange.only()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IDBKeyRange/only_static \"IDBKeyRange.only()\")\n\nCreates a new key range containing a single value.\n\n[`IDBKeyRange.lowerBound()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IDBKeyRange/lowerBound_static \"IDBKeyRange.lowerBound()\")\n\nCreates a new key range with only a lower bound.\n\n[`IDBKeyRange.upperBound()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IDBKeyRange/upperBound_static \"IDBKeyRange.upperBound()\")\n\nCreates a new upper-bound key range.\n\n## Instance methods\n[`IDBKeyRange.includes()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IDBKeyRange/includes)\n\nReturns a boolean indicating whether a specified key is inside the key range.\n\n## Examples\nThe following example illustrates how you'd use a key range. Here we declare a `keyRangeValue` as a range between values of \"A\" and \"F\". We open a transaction (using [`IDBTransaction`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IDBTransaction)) and an object store, and open a cursor with [`IDBObjectStore.openCursor`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IDBObjectStore/openCursor), declaring `keyRangeValue` as its optional key range value. This means that the cursor will only retrieve records with keys inside that range. This range includes the values \"A\" and \"F\", as we haven't declared that they should be open bounds.\nIf we used `IDBKeyRange.bound(\"A\", \"F\", true, true);`, then the range would not include \"A\" and \"F\", only the values between them.\n\n**Note:** For a more complete example allowing you to experiment with key range, have a look at our [IDBKeyRange-example](https://github.com/mdn/dom-examples/tree/main/indexeddb-examples/idbkeyrange) repo ( [view the example live too](https://mdn.github.io/dom-examples/indexeddb-examples/idbkeyrange/).)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IDBKeyRange", "title": "IDBKeyRange", "description": "The IDBKeyRange interface of the IndexedDB API represents a continuous interval over some data type that is used for keys.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"HTMLImageElement\"?\n\nAssistant: The HTMLImageElement interface represents an HTML <img> element, providing the properties and methods used to manipulate image elements.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Constructor\nImage()\n\nThe Image() constructor creates and returns a new HTMLImageElement object representing an HTML <img> element which is not attached to any DOM tree. It accepts optional width and height parameters. When called without parameters, new Image() is equivalent to calling document.createElement('img').\n\n## Instance properties\nInherits properties from its parent, HTMLElement.\n\nHTMLImageElement.alt\n\nA string that reflects the alt HTML attribute, thus indicating the alternate fallback content to be displayed if the image has not been loaded.\n\nHTMLImageElement.attributionSrc\n\nSecure contextExperimental\n\nGets and sets the attributionsrc attribute on an <img> element programmatically, reflecting the value of that attribute. attributionsrc specifies that you want the browser to send an Attribution-Reporting-Eligible header along with the image request. On the server-side this is used to trigger sending an Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source or Attribution-Reporting-Register-Trigger header in the response, to register an image-based attribution source or attribution trigger, respectively.\n\nHTMLImageElement.complete\n\nReturns a boolean value that is true if the browser has finished fetching the image, whether successful or not. That means this value is also true if the image has no src value indicating an image to load.\n\nHTMLImageElement.crossOrigin\n\nA string specifying the CORS setting for this image element. See CORS settings attributes for further details. This may be null if CORS is not used.\n\nHTMLImageElement.currentSrc\n\nReturns a string representing the URL from which the currently displayed image was loaded. This may change as the image is adjusted due to changing conditions, as directed by any media queries which are in place.\n\nHTMLImageElement.decoding\n\nAn optional string representing a hint given to the browser on how it should decode the image. If this value is provided, it must be one of the possible permitted values: sync to decode the image synchronously, async to decode it asynchronously, or auto to indicate no preference (which is the default). Read the decoding page for details on the implications of this property's values.\n\nHTMLImageElement.fetchPriority\n\nAn optional string representing a hint given to the browser on how it should prioritize fetching of the image relative to other images. If this value is provided, it must be one of the possible permitted values: high to fetch at a high priority, low to fetch at a low priority, or auto to indicate no preference (which is the default).\n\nHTMLImageElement.height\n\nAn integer value that reflects the height HTML attribute, indicating the rendered height of the image in CSS pixels.\n\nHTMLImageElement.isMap\n\nA boolean value that reflects the ismap HTML attribute, indicating that the image is part of a server-side image map. This is different from a client-side image map, specified using an <img> element and a corresponding <map> which contains <area> elements indicating the clickable areas in the image. The image must be contained within an <a> element; see the ismap page for details.\n\nHTMLImageElement.loading\n\nA string providing a hint to the browser used to optimize loading the document by determining whether to load the image immediately ( eager) or on an as-needed basis ( lazy).\n\nHTMLImageElement.naturalHeight\n\nReturns an integer value representing the intrinsic height of the image in CSS pixels, if it is available; else, it shows 0. This is the height the image would be if it were rendered at its natural full size.\n\nHTMLImageElement.naturalWidth\n\nReturns an integer value representing the intrinsic width of the image in CSS pixels, if it is available; otherwise, it will show 0. This is the width the image would be if it were rendered at its natural full size.\n\nHTMLImageElement.referrerPolicy\n\nA string that reflects the referrerpolicy HTML attribute, which tells the user agent how to decide which referrer to use in order to fetch the image. Read this article for details on the possible values of this string.\n\nHTMLImageElement.sizes\n\nA string reflecting the sizes HTML attribute. This string specifies a list of comma-separated conditional sizes for the image; that is, for a given viewport size, a particular image size is to be used. Read the documentation on the sizes page for details on the format of this string.\n\nHTMLImageElement.src\n\nA string that reflects the src HTML attribute, which contains the full URL of the image including base URI. You can load a different image into the element by changing the URL in the src attribute.\n\nHTMLImageElement.srcset\n\nA string reflecting the srcset HTML attribute. This specifies a list of candidate images, separated by commas ( ',', U+002C COMMA). Each candidate image is a URL followed by a space, followed by a specially-formatted string indicating the size of the image. The size may be specified either the width or a size multiple. Read the srcset page for specifics on the format of the size substring.\n\nHTMLImageElement.useMap\n\nA string reflecting the usemap HTML attribute, containing the page-local URL of the <map> element describing the image map to use. The page-local URL is a pound (hash) symbol (#) followed by the ID of the <map> element, such as #my-map-element. The <map> in turn contains <area> elements indicating the clickable areas in the image.\n\nHTMLImageElement.width\n\nAn integer value that reflects the width HTML attribute, indicating the rendered width of the image in CSS pixels.\n\nHTMLImageElement.x\n\nAn integer indicating the horizontal offset of the left border edge of the image's CSS layout box relative to the origin of the <html> element's containing block.\n\nHTMLImageElement.y\n\nThe integer vertical offset of the top border edge of the image's CSS layout box relative to the origin of the <html> element's containing block.\n\n## Obsolete properties\nHTMLImageElement.align\n\nDeprecated\n\nA string indicating the alignment of the image with respect to the surrounding context. The possible values are \"left\", \"right\", \"justify\", and \"center\". This is obsolete; you should instead use CSS (such as text-align, which works with images despite its name) to specify the alignment.\n\nHTMLImageElement.border\n\nDeprecated\n\nA string which defines the width of the border surrounding the image. This is deprecated; use the CSS border property instead.\n\nHTMLImageElement.hspace\n\nDeprecated\n\nAn integer value which specifies the amount of space (in pixels) to leave empty on the left and right sides of the image.\n\nHTMLImageElement.longDesc\n\nDeprecated\n\nA string specifying the URL at which a long description of the image's contents may be found. This is used to turn the image into a hyperlink automatically. Modern HTML should instead place an <img> inside an <a> element defining the hyperlink.\n\nHTMLImageElement.name\n\nDeprecated\n\nA string representing the name of the element.\n\nHTMLImageElement.vspace\n\nDeprecated\n\nAn integer value specifying the amount of empty space, in pixels, to leave above and below the image.\n\n## Instance methods\nInherits methods from its parent, HTMLElement.\n\nHTMLImageElement.decode()\n\nReturns a Promise that resolves when the image is decoded and it's safe to append the image to the DOM. This prevents rendering of the next frame from having to pause to decode the image, as would happen if an undecoded image were added to the DOM.\n\n## Errors\nIf an error occurs while trying to load or render the image, and an onerror event handler has been configured to handle the error event, that event handler will get called.

In particular, the [`Element`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element) interface is enhanced to become [`HTMLElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement) and various subclasses, each representing one of (or a family of closely related) elements.\n\nThe HTML DOM API provides access to various browser features such as tabs and windows, CSS styles and stylesheets, browser history, etc. These interfaces are discussed further in the [HTML DOM API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_DOM_API) documentation.\n\n## SVG DOM\nSimilarly, a document containing SVG is also described using the [`Document`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document) interface, which is extended by the SVG specification to include various SVG-specific features. In particular, the [`Element`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element) interface is enhanced to become [`SVGElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SVGElement) and various subclasses, each representing an element or a family of closely related elements.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"ContactsManager\"?\n\nAssistant: The ContactsManager interface of the Contact Picker API allows users to select entries from their contact list and share limited details of the selected entries with a website or application.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Secure context\nThis feature is available only in secure contexts (HTTPS), in some or all supporting browsers.\n\n## Experimental\nThis is an experimental technology. Check the Browser compatibility table carefully before using this in production.\n\n## Instance methods\nThe ContactsManager interface provides the following instance methods:\n\n- `select()`: Returns a Promise which, when resolved, presents the user with a contact picker which allows them to select contact(s) they wish to share.\n- `getProperties()`: Returns a Promise which resolves with an Array of strings indicating which contact properties are available.\n\n## Examples\n### Feature Detection\nThe following code checks whether the Contact Picker API is supported.\n\n```javascript\nconst supported = \"contacts\" in navigator && \"ContactsManager\" in window;\n```\n\n### Checking for Supported Properties\nThe following asynchronous function uses the `getProperties` method to check for supported properties.\n\n```javascript\nasync function checkProperties() {\n  const supportedProperties = await navigator.contacts.getProperties();\n  if (supportedProperties.includes(\"name\")) {\n    // run code for name support\n  }\n  if (supportedProperties.includes(\"email\")) {\n    // run code for email support\n  }\n  if (supportedProperties.includes(\"tel\")) {\n    // run code for telephone number support\n  }\n  if (supportedProperties.includes(\"address\")) {\n    // run code for address support\n  }\n  if (supportedProperties.includes(\"icon\")) {\n    // run code for avatar support\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Selecting Contacts\nThe following example sets an array of properties to be retrieved for each contact, as well as setting an options object to allow for multiple contacts to be selected.\n\n```javascript\nconst props = [\"name\", \"email\", \"tel\", \"address\", \"icon\"];\nconst opts = { multiple: true };\n\nasync function getContacts() {\n  try {\n    const contacts = await navigator.contacts.select(props, opts);\n    handleResults(contacts);\n  } catch (ex) {\n    // Handle any errors here.\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`handleResults()` is a developer defined function.\n\n##

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Certificate Transparency\"?\n\nAssistant: Certificate Transparency is an open framework designed to protect against and monitor for certificate mis-issuances. With certificate transparency, newly-issued certificates are 'logged' to publicly-run, often independent CT logs — which maintain an append-only, cryptographically-assured record of issued TLS certificates.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Background\nCT logs are built upon the foundation of the Merkle tree data structure. Nodes are labelled with the cryptographic hashes of their child nodes. Leaf nodes contain hashes of actual pieces of data. The label of the root node therefore depends on all other nodes in the tree.\n\nIn the context of certificate transparency, the data hashed by the leaf nodes are the certificates that have been issued by the various different CAs operating today. Certificate inclusion can be verified via an audit proof which can be generated and verified efficiently, in logarithmic O(log n) time.\n\nCertificate transparency initially came about in 2013 against a backdrop of CA compromises (DigiNotar breach in 2011), questionable decisions (Trustwave subordinate root incident in 2012) and technical issuance issues (weak, 512-bit certificate issuance by DigiCert Sdn Bhd of Malaysia).\n\n## Implementation\nWhen certificates are submitted to a CT log, a signed certificate timestamp (SCT) is generated and returned. This serves as a proof that the certificate has been submitted and will be added to the log.\n\nThe specification states that compliant servers must provide a number of these SCTs to TLS clients when they connect. This can be accomplished via a number of different mechanisms:\n\n- X.509v3 certificate extension which embeds signed certificate timestamps directly into the leaf certificate\n- A TLS extension of type signed_certificate_timestamp sent during the handshake\n- OCSP stapling (that is, the status_request TLS extension) and providing a SignedCertificateTimestampList with one or more SCTs\n\nWith the X.509 certificate extension, the included SCTs are decided by the issuing CA. Since June 2021, most actively used and valid publicly-trusted certificates contain transparency data embedded in this extension. This method should not require web servers to be modified.\n\nWith the latter methods, servers will need to be updated to send the required data. The advantage is that the server operator can customize the CT log sources providing the SCTs sent via the TLS extension/stapled OCSP response.\n\n## Browser Requirements\nGoogle Chrome 107 and later requires CT log inclusion for all certificates issued with a notBefore date of after 30 April 2018. Users will be prevented from visiting sites using non-compliant TLS certificates.\nChrome had previously required CT inclusion for Extended Validation (EV) and Symantec-issued certificates.\n\nApple requires a varying number of SCTs in order for Safari and other servers to trust server certificates.\n\nFirefox desktop from version 135 requires CT log inclusion for all certificates issued by certificate authorities in Mozilla's Root CA Program.\nFirefox for Android does not currently require CT log inclusion.\n\n## Specifications\nBrowser implementations are based on the obsoleted specification RFC 6962: Certificate Transparency (January 2025).\nThe current specification is RFC 9162: Certificate Transparency Version 2.0.\n\n## See also\n- Apple's Certificate Transparency log program\n- Chrome's Certificate Transparency Log Policy\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Certificate_Transparency", "title": "Certificate Transparency", "description": "Certificate Transparency is an open framework designed to protect against and monitor for certificate mis-issuances.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"FileSystemDirectoryEntry\"?\n\nAssistant: The FileSystemDirectoryEntry interface of the File and Directory Entries API represents a directory in a file system. It provides methods which make it possible to access and manipulate the files in a directory, as well as to access the entries within the directory.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Basic concepts\nYou can create a new directory by calling `getDirectory()`. If you want to create subdirectories, create each child directory in sequence. If you try creating a directory using a full path that includes parent directories that do not exist yet, an error is returned. So create the hierarchy by recursively adding a new path after creating the parent directory.\n\n## Example\nIn the following code snippet, we create a directory called \"Documents.\"\n\n```javascript\n// Taking care of the browser-specific prefixes.\nwindow.requestFileSystem =\n  window.requestFileSystem || window.webkitRequestFileSystem;\nwindow.directoryEntry = window.directoryEntry || window.webkitDirectoryEntry;\n\n// …\n\nfunction onFs(fs) {\n  fs.root.getDirectory(\n    \"Documents\",\n    { create: true },\n    (directoryEntry) => {\n      //directoryEntry.isFile === false\n      //directoryEntry.isDirectory === true\n      //directoryEntry.name === 'Documents'\n      //directoryEntry.fullPath === '/Documents'\n    },\n    onError,\n  );\n}\n\n// Opening a file system with temporary storage\nwindow.requestFileSystem(TEMPORARY, 1024 * 1024 /*1MB*/, onFs, onError);\n```\n\n## Instance properties\nThis interface has no properties of its own, but inherits properties from its parent interface, `FileSystemEntry`.\n\n## Instance methods\nThis interface inherits methods from its parent interface, `FileSystemEntry`.\n\n- `createReader()`: Creates a `FileSystemDirectoryReader` object which can be used to read the entries in this directory.\n- `getDirectory()`: Returns a `FileSystemDirectoryEntry` object representing a directory located at a given path, relative to the directory on which the method is called.\n- `getFile()`: Returns a `FileSystemFileEntry` object representing a file located within the directory's hierarchy, given a path relative to the directory on which the method is called.\n- `removeRecursively()`: Deprecated Non-standard. Removes the directory as well as all of its content, hierarchically iterating over its entire subtree of descendant files and directories.\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [File and Directory Entries API<br># api-directoryentry](https://wicg.github.io/entries-api/#api-directoryentry) |\n\n## Browser compatibility\n\n\n## See also\n- [File and Directory Entries API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_and_Directory_Entries_API)\n- [`FileSystemDirectoryReader`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileSystemDirectoryReader)\n- [`FileSystemEntry`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileSystemEntry)\n- [`FileSystemFileEntry`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileSystemFileEntry)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileSystemDirectoryEntry", "title": "FileSystemDirectoryEntry", "description": "The FileSystemDirectoryEntry interface of the File and Directory Entries API represents a directory in a file system.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Forms\"?\n\nAssistant: This module provides a series of articles that will help you master the essentials of web forms. Web forms are a very powerful tool for interacting with users — most commonly they are used for collecting data from users, or allowing them to control a user interface. However, for historical and technical reasons, it's not always obvious how to use them to their full potential.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Prerequisites\nBefore starting this module, you should at least work through our [Introduction to HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content). At this point you should find the [Introductory tutorials](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms#introductory_tutorials) easy to understand, and also be able to make use of our [Basic native form controls](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Basic_native_form_controls) tutorial.\n\nMastering forms however requires more than just HTML knowledge — you also need to learn some specific techniques to style form controls, and some scripting knowledge is required to handle things like validation and creating custom form controls. Therefore, before you look at the other sections listed below we'd recommend that you go away and learn some [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics) and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting) first.\n\nThe above text is a good indicator as to why we've put web forms into its own standalone module, rather than trying to mix bits of it into the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript topic areas — form elements are more complex than most other HTML elements, and they also require a close marriage of related CSS and JavaScript techniques to get the most out of them.\n\n**Note:**\nIf you are working on a computer/tablet/other device where you don't have the ability to create your own files, you could try out (most of) the code examples in an online coding program such as [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com/) or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/).\n\n## Introductory tutorials\n[Your first form](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Your_first_form)\n\nThe first article in our series provides your very first experience of creating a web form, including designing a simple form, implementing it using the right HTML elements, adding some very simple styling via CSS, and how data is sent to a server.\n\n[How to structure a web form](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/How_to_structure_a_web_form)\n\nWith the basics out of the way, we now look in more detail at the elements used to provide structure and meaning to the different parts of a form.\n\n## The different form controls\n[Basic native form controls](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Basic_native_form_controls)\n\nWe start off this section by looking at the functionality of the original HTML [`<input>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) types in detail, looking at what options are available to collect different types of data.\n\n[The HTML5 input types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/HTML5_input_types)\n\nHere we continue our deep dive into the `<input>` element, looking at the additional input types provided when HTML5 was released, and the various UI controls and data collection enhancements they provide. Additionally, we look at the [`<output>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/output) element.\n\n[Other form controls](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Other_form_controls)\n\nNext we take a look at all the non- `<input>` form controls and associated tools, such as [`<select>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select), [`<textarea>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/textarea), [`<meter>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meter), and [`<progress>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/progress).\n\n## Form styling tutorials\n[Styling web forms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Styling_web_forms)\n\nThis article provides an introduction to styling forms with CSS, including all the basics you might need to know for basic styling tasks.\n\n[Advanced form styling](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Advanced_form_styling)\n\nHere we look at some more advanced form styling techniques that need to be used when trying to deal with some of the more difficult-to-style form elements.\n\n[UI pseudo-classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/UI_pseudo-classes)\n\nAn introduction to the UI pseudo-classes enabling HTML form controls to be targeted based on their current state.\n\n## Validating and submitting form data\n[Client-side form validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Form_validation)\n\nSending data is not enough — we also need to make sure that the data users enter into forms is in the correct format to process it successfully, and that it won't break our applications. We also want to help our users to fill out our forms correctly and not get frustrated when trying to use our apps. Form validation helps us achieve these goals — this article tells you what you need to know.\n\n[Sending form data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Sending_and_retrieving_form_data)\n\nThis article looks at what happens when a user submits a form — where does the data go, and how do we handle it when it gets there? We also look at some of the security concerns associated with sending form data.\n\n## Advanced articles\nThe following articles aren't included in the learning pathway, but they'll prove interesting and useful when you've mastered the above techniques and want to know more.\n\n[How to build custom form controls](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/How_to_build_custom_form_controls)\n\nYou'll come across some cases where the native form widgets just don't provide what you need, e.g. because of styling or functionality. In such cases, you may need to build your own form widget out of raw HTML. This article explains how you'd do this and the considerations you need to be aware of when doing so, with a practical case study.\n\n[Sending forms through JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Sending_forms_through_JavaScript)\n\nThis article looks at ways to use a form to assemble an HTTP request and send it via custom JavaScript, rather than standard form submission. It also looks at why you'd want to do this, and the implications of doing so.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"HTTP response status codes\"?\n\nAssistant: HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed. Responses are grouped in five classes: Informational responses, Successful responses, Redirection messages, Client error responses, and Server error responses.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Informational responses\n100 Continue: This interim response indicates that the client should continue the request or ignore the response if the request is already finished.\n\n101 Switching Protocols: This code is sent in response to an Upgrade request header from the client and indicates the protocol the server is switching to.\n\n102 Processing: Deprecated. This code was used in WebDAV contexts to indicate that a request has been received by the server, but no status was available at the time of the response.\n\n103 Early Hints: This status code is primarily intended to be used with the Link header, letting the user agent start preloading resources while the server prepares a response or preconnect to an origin from which the page will need resources.\n\n## Successful responses\n200 OK: The request succeeded. The result and meaning of \"success\" depends on the HTTP method:\n- GET: The resource has been fetched and transmitted in the message body.\n- HEAD: Representation headers are included in the response without any message body.\n- PUT or POST: The resource describing the result of the action is transmitted in the message body.\n- TRACE: The message body contains the request as received by the server.\n\n201 Created: The request succeeded, and a new resource was created as a result. This is typically the response sent after POST requests, or some PUT requests.\n\n202 Accepted: The request has been received but not yet acted upon. It is noncommittal, since there is no way in HTTP to later send an asynchronous response indicating the outcome of the request.\n\n203 Non-Authoritative Information: This response code means the returned metadata is not exactly the same as is available from the origin server, but is collected from a local or a third-party copy.\n\n204 No Content: There is no content to send for this request, but the headers are useful.\n\n205 Reset Content: Tells the user agent to reset the document which sent this request.\n\n206 Partial Content: This response code is used in response to a range request when the client has requested a part or parts of a resource.\n\n207 Multi-Status (WebDAV): Conveys information about multiple resources, for situations where multiple status codes might be appropriate.\n\n208 Already Reported (WebDAV): Used inside a <dav:propstat> response element to avoid repeatedly enumerating the internal members of multiple bindings to the same collection.\n\n226 IM Used (HTTP Delta encoding): The server has fulfilled a GET request for the resource, and the response is a representation of the result of one or more instance-manipulations applied to the current instance.\n\n## Redirection messages\n300 Multiple Choices: In agent-driven content negotiation, the request has more than one possible response and the user agent or user should choose one of them.\n\n301 Moved Permanently: The URL of the requested resource has been changed permanently. The new URL is given in the response.\n\n302 Found: This response code means that the URI of requested resource has been changed temporarily.\n\n303 See Other: The server sent this response to direct the client to get the requested resource at another URI with a GET request.\n\n304 Not Modified: This is used for caching purposes. It tells the client that the response has not been modified.\n\n305 Use Proxy: Deprecated. Defined in a previous version of the HTTP specification to indicate that a requested response must be accessed by a proxy.\n\n306 unused: This response code is no longer used; but is reserved.\n\n307 Temporary Redirect: The server sends this response to direct the client to get the requested resource at another URI with the same method that was used in the prior request.\n\n308 Permanent Redirect: This means that the resource is now permanently located at another URI, specified by the Location response header.\n\n## Client error responses\n400 Bad Request: The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error.\n\n401 Unauthorized: Although the HTTP standard specifies \"unauthorized\", semantically this response means \"unauthenticated\".\n\n402 Payment Required: The initial purpose of this code was for digital payment systems, however this status code is rarely used.\n\n403 Forbidden: The client does not have access rights to the content; that is, it is unauthorized.\n\n404 Not Found: The server cannot find the requested resource.\n\n405 Method Not Allowed: The request method is known by the server but is not supported by the target resource.\n\n406 Not Acceptable: This response is sent when the web server doesn't find any content that conforms to the criteria given by the user agent.\n\n407 Proxy Authentication Required: This is similar to 401 Unauthorized but authentication is needed to be done by a proxy.\n\n408 Request Timeout: This response is sent on an idle connection by some servers.\n\n409 Conflict: This response is sent when a request conflicts with the current state of the server.\n\n410 Gone: This response is sent when the requested content has been permanently deleted from server.\n\n411 Length Required: Server rejected the request because the Content-Length header field is not defined.\n\n412 Precondition Failed: In conditional requests, the client has indicated preconditions in its headers which the server does not meet.\n\n413 Content Too Large: The request body is larger than limits defined by server.\n\n414 URI Too Long: The URI requested by the client is longer than the server is willing to interpret.\n\n415 Unsupported Media Type: The media format of the requested data is not supported by the server.\n\n416 Range Not Satisfiable: The ranges specified by the Range header field in the request cannot be fulfilled.\n\n417 Expectation Failed: This response code means the expectation indicated by the Expect request header field cannot be met by the server.\n\n418 I'm a teapot: The server refuses the attempt to brew coffee with a teapot.\n\n421 Misdirected Request: The request was directed at a server that is not able to produce a response.\n\n422 Unprocessable Content (WebDAV): The request was well-formed but was unable to be followed due to semantic errors.\n\n423 Locked (WebDAV): The resource that is being accessed is locked.\n\n424 Failed Dependency (WebDAV): The request failed due to failure of a previous request.\n\n425 Too Early: Indicates that the server is unwilling to risk processing a request that might be replayed.\n\n426 Upgrade Required: The server refuses to perform the request using the current protocol but might be willing to do so after the client upgrades to a different protocol.\n\n428 Precondition Required: The origin server requires the request to be conditional.\n\n429 Too Many Requests: The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time.\n\n431 Request Header Fields Too Large: The server is unwilling to process the request because its header fields are too large.\n\n451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons: The user agent requested a resource that cannot legally be provided.\n\n## Server error responses\n500 Internal Server Error: The server has encountered a situation it does not know how to handle.\n\n501 Not Implemented: The request method is not supported by the server and cannot be handled.\n\n502 Bad Gateway: This error response means that the server, while working as a gateway, got an invalid response.\n\n503 Service Unavailable: The server is not ready to handle the request.\n\n504 Gateway Timeout: This error response is given when the server is acting as a gateway and cannot get a response in time.\n\n505 HTTP Version Not Supported: The HTTP version used in the request is not supported by the server.\n\n506 Variant Also Negotiates: The server has an internal configuration error.\n\n507 Insufficient Storage (WebDAV): The method could not be performed on the resource because the server is unable to store the representation needed.\n\n508 Loop Detected (WebDAV): The server detected an infinite loop while processing the request.\n\n510 Not Extended: The client request declares an HTTP Extension that should be used to process the request, but the extension is not supported.\n\n511 Network Authentication Required: Indicates that the client needs to authenticate to gain network access.\n\n## Browser compatibility\nThe compatibility table on this page is generated from structured data.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Transport Layer Security (TLS)\"?\n\nAssistant: This article provides an overview of TLS and the kinds of decisions you need to make when securing your content.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## History\nWhen HTTPS was introduced, it was based on Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 2.0, a technology introduced by Netscape. It was updated to SSL 3.0 not long after, and as its usage expanded, it became clear that a common, standard encryption technology needed to be specified to ensure interoperability among all web browsers and servers. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) specified TLS 1.0 in RFC 2246 in January 1999. The current version of TLS is 1.3 (RFC 8446).\n\nDespite the fact that the web now uses TLS for encryption, many people still refer to it as \"SSL\" out of habit.\n\nAlthough TLS can be used on top of any low-level transport protocol, the original goal of the protocol was to encrypt HTTP traffic. HTTP encrypted using TLS is commonly referred to as HTTPS. TLS-encrypted web traffic is by convention exchanged on port 443 by default, while unencrypted HTTP uses port 80 by default. HTTPS remains an important use case for TLS.\n\n## HTTP over TLS\nTLS provides three primary services that help ensure the safety and security of data exchanged with it:\n\nAuthentication lets each party to the communication verify that the other party is who they claim to be.\n\nData is encrypted while being transmitted between the user agent and the server, in order to prevent it from being read and interpreted by unauthorized parties.\n\nTLS ensures that between encrypting, transmitting, and decrypting the data, no information is lost, damaged, tampered with, or falsified.\n\nA TLS connection starts with a handshake phase where a client and server agree on a shared secret and important parameters, like cipher suites, are negotiated. Once parameters and a data exchange mode where application data, such HTTP, is exchanged.\n\n## Cipher suites\nThe primary parameters that the TLS handshake negotiates is a cipher suite.\n\nIn TLS 1.2 and earlier, the negotiated cipher suite includes a set of cryptographic algorithms that together provide the negotiation of the shared secret, the means by which a server is authenticated, and the method that will be used to encrypt data.\n\nThe cipher suite in TLS 1.3 primarily governs the encryption of data, separate negotiation methods are used for key agreement and authentication.\n\nDifferent software might use different names for the same cipher suites. For instance, the names used in OpenSSL and GnuTLS differ from those in the TLS standards. The cipher names correspondence table on the Mozilla OpSec team's article on TLS configurations lists these names as well as information about compatibility and security levels.\n\n## Configuring your server\nCorrectly configuring your server is crucial. In general, you should try to limit cipher support to the newest ciphers possible which are compatible with the browsers you want to be able to connect to your site. The Mozilla OpSec guide to TLS configurations provides more information on recommended configurations.\n\nTo assist you in configuring your site, Mozilla provides a helpful TLS configuration generator that will generate configuration files for the following Web servers:\n\n- Apache\n- Nginx\n- Lighttpd\n- HAProxy\n- Amazon Web Services CloudFormation Elastic Load Balancer\n\nUsing the configurator is a recommended way to create the configuration to meet your needs; then copy and paste it into the appropriate file on your server and restart the server to pick up the changes. The configuration file may need some adjustments to include custom settings, so be sure to review the generated configuration before using it; installing the configuration file without ensuring any references to domain names and the like are correct will result in a server that just doesn't work.\n\n## TLS 1.3\nRFC 8446: TLS 1.3 is a major revision to TLS. TLS 1.3 includes numerous changes that improve security and performance. The goals of TLS 1.3 are:\n\n- Remove unused and unsafe features of TLS 1.2.\n- Include strong security analysis in the design.\n- Improve privacy by encrypting more of the protocol.\n- Reduce the time needed to complete a handshake.\n\nTLS 1.3 changes much of the protocol fundamentals, but preserves almost all of the basic capabilities of previous TLS versions. For the web, TLS 1.3 can be enabled without affecting compatibility with some rare exceptions (see below).\n\nThe major changes in TLS 1.3 are:\n\n- The TLS 1.3 handshake completes in one round trip in most cases, reducing handshake latency.\n- A server can enable a 0-RTT (zero round trip time) handshake. Clients that reconnect to the server can send requests immediately, eliminating the latency of the TLS handshake entirely. Though the performance gains from 0-RTT can be significant, they come with some risk of replay attack, so some care is needed before enabling this feature.\n- TLS 1.3 supports forward-secure modes only, unless the connection is resumed or it uses a pre-shared key.\n- TLS 1.3 defines a new set of cipher suites that are exclusive to TLS 1.3. These cipher suites all use modern Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) algorithms.\n- The TLS 1.3 handshake is encrypted, except for the messages that are necessary to establish a shared secret. In particular, this means that server and client certificates are encrypted. Note however that the server identity (the server_name or SNI extension) that a client sends to the server is not encrypted.\n- Numerous mechanisms have been disabled: renegotiation, generic data compression, Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) certificates, static RSA key exchange, and key exchange with custom Diffie-Hellman (DH) groups.\n\nImplementations of draft versions of TLS 1.3 are available. TLS 1.3 is enabled in some browsers, including the 0-RTT mode. Web servers that enable TLS 1.3 might need to adjust configuration to allow TLS 1.3 to operate successfully.\n\nTLS 1.3 adds just one significant new use case. The 0-RTT handshake can provide significant performance gains for latency sensitive applications, like the web. Enabling 0-RTT requires additional steps, both to ensure successful deployment and to manage the risks of replay attacks.\n\nThe removal of renegotiation in TLS 1.3 might affect some web servers that rely on client authentication using certificates. Some web servers use renegotiation to either ensure that client certificates are encrypted, or to request client certificates only when certain resources are requested. For the privacy of client certificates, the encryption of the TLS 1.3 handshake ensures that client certificates are encrypted; however this might require some software changes. Reactive client authentication using certificates is supported by TLS 1.3 but not widely implemented. Alternative mechanisms are in the process of being developed, which will also support HTTP/2.\n\n## Retiring old TLS versions\nTo help with working towards a more modern, more secure web, all major browsers began removing support for TLS 1.0 and 1.1 in early 2020. You'll need to make sure your web server supports TLS 1.2 or 1.3 going forward.\n\nFrom version 74 onwards, Firefox will return a Secure Connection Failed error when connecting to servers using the older TLS versions.\n\n## TLS handshake timeout values\nIf the TLS handshake starts to become slow or unresponsive for some reason, the user's experience can be affected significantly. To mitigate this problem, modern browsers have implemented handshake timeouts:\n\n- Since version 58, Firefox implements a TLS handshake timeout with a default value of 30 seconds. The timeout value can be varied by editing the network.http.tls-handshake-timeout pref in about:config.\n\n## See also\n- The Mozilla SSL Configuration Generator and Cipherlist.eu can help you generate configuration files for your server to secure your site.\n- The Mozilla Operations Security (OpSec) team maintains a wiki page with reference TLS configurations.\n- Use HTTP Observatory and SSL Labs to test how secure a site's HTTP/TLS configuration is.\n- Secure Contexts\n- Strict-Transport-Security HTTP header\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Transport_Layer_Security", "title": "Transport Layer Security (TLS)", "description": "This article provides an overview of TLS and the kinds of decisions you need to make when securing your content.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 8, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 01:44:35", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "og:type": "website", "og:image:width": "1920", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Transport_Layer_Security", "description": "The security of any connection using Transport Layer Security (TLS) is heavily dependent upon the cipher suites and security parameters selected.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Storage API\"?\n\nAssistant: The Storage API provides a shared storage system designed to be used by all APIs and technologies that websites can use to store data in a user's browser.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Concepts and usage\nThe storage system described by the Storage Standard, where site data is stored, usually consists of a single _bucket_ for each origin. In essence, every website has its own storage space into which its data gets placed. In some cases however, user agents may decide to store a single origin's data in multiple different buckets, for example when this origin is embedded in different third-party origins.\n\n## Storage buckets\nThe storage system described by the Storage Standard, where site data is stored, usually consists of a single _bucket_ for each origin. In essence, every website has its own storage space into which its data gets placed. In some cases however, user agents may decide to store a single origin's data in multiple different buckets, for example when this origin is embedded in different third-party origins.\n\n## Bucket modes\nEach site storage bucket has a _mode_ that describes the data retention policy for that bucket. There are two modes: \"best-effort\" and \"persistent\". The user agent will try to retain the data contained in the bucket for as long as it can, but will not warn users if storage space runs low and it becomes necessary to clear the bucket in order to relieve the storage pressure. The user agent will retain the data as long as possible, clearing all \"best-effort\" buckets before considering clearing a bucket marked \"persistent\".\n\n## Quotas and usage estimates\nThe user agent determines, using whatever mechanism it chooses, the maximum amount of storage a given site can use. This maximum is the origin's **quota**. The amount of this space which is in use by the site is called its **usage**. Both of these values are estimates; there are several reasons why they're not precise.\n\n## Data eviction\nData eviction is the process by which a user agent deletes an origin's stored data. This can happen, for example, when the device used to store the data is running low on storage space. When clearing the data stored by an origin, the origin's bucket is treated as a single entity.\n\n## Interfaces\nThe StorageManager provides an interface for managing persistence permissions and estimating available storage.\n\n## Extensions to other interfaces\nNavigator.storage returns the singleton StorageManager object used for managing persistence permissions and estimating available storage on a site-by-site/app-by-app basis.\n\n## Specifications\nThe Storage Standard defines a shared storage system designed to be used by all APIs and technologies that websites can use to store data in a user's browser.\n\n## Browser compatibility\nThe compatibility table on this page is generated from structured data.\n\n## See also\nLinks to related resources and documentation.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage_API", "title": "Storage API", "description": "The Storage API provides a shared storage system designed to be used by all APIs and technologies that websites can use to store data in a user's browser.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 10, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 01:45:26", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:title": "Storage API - Web APIs | MDN", "title": "Storage API - Web APIs | MDN", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage_API", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage_API", "og:image:type": "image/png", "og:image:height": "1080", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "og:description": "The Storage Standard defines a shared storage system designed to be used by all APIs and technologies that websites can use to store data in a user's browser.", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "ogDescription": "The Storage Standard defines a shared storage system designed to be used by all APIs and technologies that websites can use to store data in a user's browser.", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "position": ["1", "2", "3"], "og:type": "website", "description": "The Storage Standard defines a shared storage system designed to be used by all APIs and technologies that websites can use to store data in a user's browser.", "ogTitle": "Storage API - Web APIs | MDN", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "language": "en-US", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "ogLocale": "en_US", "og:locale": "en_US", "og:image:width": "1920", "scrapeId": "72df2cc9-c6fd-4a41-b4dd-df2ecee415ec", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage_API", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage_API", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Semantic HTML\"?\n\nAssistant: HTML is the technology that defines the content and structure of any website. Written properly, it should also define the semantics (meaning) of the content in a machine-readable way, which is vital for accessibility, search engine optimization, and making use of the built-in features browsers provide for content to work optimally. This module covers the basics of the language, before looking at key areas such as document structure, links, lists, images, forms, and more.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## 2.1 Basic HTML syntax\nLearning outcomes:\n\n- The need for a doctype at the top of HTML documents. Its original intended purpose, and the fact that now it is somewhat of a historical artifact.\n\n- The need to set the language of a document using the `lang` attribute in the opening `<html>` tag.\n\n- The HTML head, and its purpose as a metadata container for the document including key uses:\n  - Setting information like character encoding and title.\n\n  - Providing metadata for search engines (e.g. `<meta name=\"description\">`) and social media platforms (e.g. [Open Graph Data](https://ogp.me/)), and the Search Engine Optimization (SEO) benefits.\n\n  - Linking to icons for use on browsers and mobile platforms.\n\n  - Linking to stylesheets and script files.\n- The HTML body and its purpose as a container for the page content.\n\n- The anatomy of an HTML element — element, opening tag, content, closing tag, attributes.\n\n- What [void elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/Void_element) (also known as empty elements) are, and how they differ from other elements.\n\nResources:\n\n- [Getting started with HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Basic_HTML_syntax)\n\n- [What's in the head? Metadata in HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Webpage_metadata)\n\n## 2.2 Good document structure\nLearning outcomes:\n\n- How to create a good document structure with headings and content beneath those headings.\n\n- Using semantic HTML rather than presentational HTML:\n\n  - Some presentational markup should no longer be used at all (e.g. `<big>` and `<font>`); it is deprecated.\n\n  - Some presentational markup has been repurposed to have new semantic meaning (e.g. `<i>` and `<b>`).\n\n  - It is tempting to just use `<div>` elements wherever a block-level container is required, but you should be aware of the other available structural elements and their benefits (such as improved accessibility). Examples include `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<header>`, `<nav>`, and `<footer>`.\n\n> **Notes**:\n>\n> One key point to understand here is the difference between semantic and presentational markup, what these terms mean, and why semantic markup is important to SEO and accessibility.\n\n- The need for heading levels to be used logically, i.e. no skipping levels or using them arbitrarily because you want to achieve a certain font size (that's a job for CSS).\n\n- SEO benefits: for example, keywords are boosted in headings.\n\n> **Notes**:\n>\n> This conformance criterium doesn't require that you go too deep into strategies for writing SEO-friendly content, although you should understand what this means.\n\n- Accessibility benefits: Assistive technology (AT) such as screen readers use headings and landmarks as signposts to navigate content. HTML documents are very difficult for AT users to use without headings.\n\n- Understanding that HTML needs to be correctly nested. If not, the browser has to guess what you meant your structure to be, and it might not be what you wanted.\n\n- Validating your markup using the [HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/) or another similar tool (for example, [view source](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/view_source/index.html) in Firefox highlights validation errors with a dotted red underline).\n\nResources:\n\n- [HTML text fundamentals](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Headings_and_paragraphs)\n\n- [Document and website structure](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Structuring_documents)\n\n- [What is accessibility?](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/What_is_accessibility)\n\n## 2.3 Lists\nLearning outcomes:\n\n- The HTML structure for the three types of lists — unordered, ordered, and description.\n\n- Understand that description lists are less commonly used than the other two types, with use cases mainly in areas such as academia and documentation.\n\n- The correct usage for each list type.\n\n> **Notes**:\n>\n> - Unordered lists are for marking up a list of items where the order doesn't matter, such as a shopping list.\n> - Ordered lists are for marking up a list of items where the order does matter, such as a set of directions.\n> - Description lists are for associating a list of terms with descriptions of those terms, for example, product names and descriptions in a shopping cart.\n\n- The broader use cases of lists, such as navigation menus.\n\nResources:\n\n- [HTML text fundamentals > Lists](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Headings_and_paragraphs#lists)\n\n- [Advanced text formatting > Description lists](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Advanced_text_features#description_lists)\n\n## 2.4 Advanced text techniques\nLearning outcomes:\n\n- Correct usage of elements for emphasis and importance, such as `<strong>` and `<em>`.\n\n- Understand HTML elements that represent other less common semantic requirements, for example:\n  - Quotations.\n\n  - Abbreviations and acronyms.\n\n  - Addresses.\n\n  - Times and dates.\n\n  - Superscript and subscript.\n\n  - HTML entities.\n\n  - Other text markup features such as `<u>`, `<s>`, and `<ruby>`.\n\n> **Notes**:\n>\n> It is not necessary to have an exhaustive understanding of all the semantic elements HTML offers at this stage, but you should understand that they exist, and how to look them up using MDN if you need them.\n\nResources:\n\n- [HTML text fundamentals > Emphasis and importance](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Headings_and_paragraphs#emphasis_and_importance)\n\n- [Advanced text formatting](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Advanced_text_features)\n\n- [A delightful reference for HTML Symbols, Entities and ASCII Character Codes](https://www.toptal.com/designers/htmlarrows/), Toptal (2023)\n\n## 2.5 Links\nLearning outcomes:\n\n- Understand why links are _the_ fundamental feature of the web. There is no web without links.\n\n- The `href` attribute.\n\n- Absolute and relative paths, and when to use them.\n\n- Path syntax in detail — slashes, single dot, and double dot.\n\n- Link states and why they are important — `:hover`, `:focus`, `:visited`, and `:active`.\n\n- Inline and block-level links.\n\n- Understanding the benefits of writing good link text, such as better accessibility for screenreader users, and potential positive SEO effects.\n\nResources:\n\n- [Anchor tags](https://v2.scrimba.com/the-frontend-developer-career-path-c0j/~0p?via=mdn), Scrimba _Course Partner_\n\n- [Creating hyperlinks](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Creating_links)\n\n## 2.6 Media\nLearning outcomes:\n\n- The term \"replaced element\" — what does it mean?\n\n- Images, audio, video:\n  - The basics — `<img>`, `<audio>`, and `<video>` tags.\n\n  - Using `src` to point to a resource (Paths are also important here; see [2.5 Links](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/curriculum/core/semantic-html/#2.5_links)).\n\n  - Using `width` and `height`, for example, to avoid unpleasant jerky updates to the UI once an image has finished loading and is displayed.\n\n  - Video and audio-specific attributes such as `controls` and `muted`.\n\n  - `<sources>`.\n\n  - Optimizing media assets for the web — keep file sizes small.\n- Media assets and licensing:\n  - Different types of licensing — public domain/CC0, permissive (e.g. CC license, MIT), copyrighted (rights-managed/royalty-free).\n\n  - Searching for appropriately licensed media files to use in projects, e.g. via [Google Images](https://images.google.co.uk/), [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/), and [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/).\n\n  - Complying with license requirements.\n- Alternative text (\"alt text\") for media.\n\nResources:\n\n- [What is multimedia?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-multimedia/), Geeks for geeks (2023)\n\n- [Multimedia and embedding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content)\n\n## 2.7 Other interactive elements\nLearning outcomes:\n\n- Aside from links, `<button>` and form elements are the main tools for building controls for users to interact with your sites.\n\n> **Notes**:\n>\n> There are a lot of input types and form features not explicitly mentioned here; the purpose is to get a good general introduction to buttons and form elements, and learn the most common cases. The advanced/specialized cases can be studied on a need-to-know basis, as part of a web developer's constant learning throughout their career.\n\n- `<button>`:\n  - Button types — `button`, `submit`, and `reset`.\n\n  - Why reset buttons are nearly always a bad idea.\n- Common `<input>` types — `text`, `number`, `file`, `checkbox`, `radio`, `password`, `search`, and `submit`.\n\n- Common attributes — `name` and `value`.\n\n- Client-side validation basics — `required`, `min`, `max`, `minlength`, `maxlength`, and `pattern`.\n\n> **Notes**:\n>\n> Make sure to understand that client-side form validation is really a usability enhancement, to be used alongside server-side form validation.

For example, use a `<button>` to submit your form, and not a `<div>` programmed to behave like a `<button>`.\n> - Understand the features programmed into `<button>` s and form elements by the browser by default, and how important they are. Examples include keyboard accessibility, focus outlines, and semantic meaning for AT to identify the elements and communicate their meaning.\n\n- Form states and why they are important — `:focus`, `:readonly`, `:disabled`, etc.\n\n- `<textarea>`.\n\n- `<select>` and `<option>`.\n\n- `<form>` elements:\n  - Form submission: what happens when a form is submitted.\n\n  - The difference between submission methods — `GET`, `POST`, etc.\n\nResources:\n\n- [Input tags](https://v2.scrimba.com/the-frontend-developer-career-path-c0j/~0n?via=mdn), Scrimba _Course Partner_\n\n- [Web forms — Working with user data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms)\n\n## 2.8 HTML tables\nLearning outcomes:\n\n- What tables are for — structuring tabular data.\n\n- What tables are not for — layout, or _anything else_.\n\n- Basic tables — `<table>`, `<tr>`, and `<td>`.\n\n- `colspan` and `rowspan`.\n\n- Better table structuring for accessibility — `<th>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tfoot>`, `<caption>`, and the `scope` attribute.\n\nResources:\n\n- [HTML tables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/HTML_table_basics)\n\n## 2.9 Debugging HTML\nLearning outcomes:\n\n- Use the [HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to see if you have any markup errors.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"MDN Community Roles and Teams\"?\n\nAssistant: This page describes the various roles and teams within the MDN Web Docs community, detailing the responsibilities, requirements, and privileges associated with each role.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Roles\nIn the MDN Web Docs project, you can take on the role of a contributor, an organization member, a maintainer, or an owner. The progression from one role to the next is a step-by-step journey. With the advancement in your responsibilities, you could serve more than one role at the same time. Roles such as invited expert can be directly obtained if you've demonstrated expertise in a particular area.\n\nIrrespective of the role you take on in this project, you are always a contributor. A contributor is the base role and all other roles are built on top of it. So while working on this project in any capacity, you must satisfy the requirements of the contributor role.\n\n## Contributor\nContributors, or community participants, add to the project with their time, skills, opinions, and ideas. Contributors work on the project directly and add value to it. Apart from writing and testing code, contributions include creating and updating documentation, researching, fixing bugs, and helping other community members.\n\nDepending on the frequency of your contributions, you can be someone who contributes occasionally or an active contributor. If you demonstrate a large impact on the project, you may be nominated as a spotlight contributor or be promoted to an organization member.\n\nIf you're new here and you would like to become a contributor, take a look at our contribution guide and the repositories in the MDN GitHub organization.\n\nAs a contributor, you can get involved with the project by engaging in the following activities:\n- Participating in community discussions on the communication channels.\n- Helping other contributors with their pull requests and issues or mentoring new contributors.\n- Submitting bug reports. Check out the main repositories for more information.\n- Commenting on issues to move conversations towards a fruitful resolution.\n- Addressing open issues (for example, in the content repository) by submitting pull requests.\n- Attending community events.\n- Helping to promote the MDN project.\n\n## Requirements\nTo be a contributor, you must follow:\n- Mozilla's code of conduct\n- Contribution guidelines (check the CONTRIBUTING.md file in each repository; for example, these are the contribution guidelines for the mdn/content repository).\n\n## Privileges\nContributors enjoy the following privileges:\n- Invitations to contributor events.\n- Eligibility to become an organization member.\n\n## Organization member\nOrganization members are established contributors who participate in and contribute to the MDN Web Docs project regularly.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Your First Website\"?\n\nAssistant: This module introduces you to the practicalities of web development. You'll gather the assets and write the code to construct a simple webpage, then publish it for the world to see.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Prerequisites\nThis module assumes no prior knowledge of web technologies, but you should already be comfortable with using your operating system, including using the file system and browsing the web. You should have a code editor and multiple web browsers installed.\n\nIf this is not the case, we'd suggest that you run through the Environment setup module first.\n\n## Tutorials\n1. **What will your website look like?**  \nBefore you start writing the code for your website, you should plan it first. What information are you showcasing? What fonts and colors are you using? Here we'll outline a simple method that you can follow to plan out your site's content and design.\n\n2. **Creating the content**  \nHTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. This article provides a basic understanding of HTML and its functions, and shows you how to create the basic content for your first website.\n\n3. **Styling the content**  \nCSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that styles web content. Styling the content walks through what you need to get started. We'll answer questions like: How do I make text red? How do I make content display at a certain location in the (webpage) layout? How do I decorate my webpage with background images and colors?\n\n4. **Adding interactivity**  \nJavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to websites. This happens in games, in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms, with dynamic styling, with animation, etc. This article helps you get started with JavaScript and furthers your understanding of what is possible.\n\n5. **Publishing your website**  \nOnce you finish writing the code and organizing the files that make up your website, you need to put it all online so people can find it. This article explains how to get your sample website online with little effort.\n\n## See also\n[The Frontend Developer Career Path](https://v2.scrimba.com/the-frontend-developer-career-path-c0j?via=mdn) MDN learning partner\n\n[Scrimba's](https://scrimba.com/?via=mdn) Frontend Developer Career Path teaches all you need to know to be a competent front-end web developer, with fun interactive lessons and challenges, knowledgeable teachers, and a supportive community.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"outline\"?\n\nAssistant: The `outline` CSS shorthand property sets most of the outline properties in a single declaration.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Constituent properties\nThis property is a shorthand for the following CSS properties:\n\n- [`outline-width`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/outline-width)\n- [`outline-style`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/outline-style)\n- [`outline-color`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/outline-color)\n\n## Syntax\ncssCopy to Clipboard\n\n```\n/* style */\noutline: solid;\n\n/* style | color */\noutline: dashed #f66;\n\n/* width | style */\noutline: thick inset;\n\n/* width | style | color*/\noutline: 3px solid green;\n\n/* Global values */\noutline: inherit;\noutline: initial;\noutline: revert;\noutline: revert-layer;\noutline: unset;\n```\n\nThe `outline` property may be specified using one, two, or three of the values listed below. The order of the values does not matter. As with all shorthand properties, any omitted sub-values will be set to their [initial value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/initial_value).\n\n## Values\n[`<'outline-width'>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/outline#outline-width)\n\nSets the thickness of the outline. Defaults to `medium` if absent. See [`outline-width`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/outline-width).\n\n[`<'outline-style'>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/outline#outline-style)\n\nSets the style of the outline. Defaults to `none` if absent. See [`outline-style`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/outline-style).\n\n[`<'outline-color'>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/outline#outline-color)\n\nSets the color of the outline. Defaults to `invert` for browsers supporting it, `currentcolor` for the others. See [`outline-color`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/outline-color).\n\n## Description\nOutline is a line outside of the element's [border](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border). Unlike other areas of the box, outlines don't take up space, so they don't affect the layout of the document in any way.\n\nThere are a few properties that affect an outline's appearance. It is possible to change the style, color, and width using the `outline` property, the distance from the border using the [`outline-offset`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/outline-offset) property, and corner angles using the [`border-radius`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-radius) property.\n\nAn outline is not required to be rectangular: While dealing with multiline text, some browsers will draw an outline for each line box separately, while others will wrap the whole text with a single outline.\n\n## Accessibility\nAssigning `outline` a value of `0` or `none` will remove the browser's default focus style. If an element can be interacted with it must have a visible focus indicator. Provide obvious focus styling if the default focus style is removed.\n\n- [How to Design Useful and Usable Focus Indicators](https://www.deque.com/blog/give-site-focus-tips-designing-usable-focus-indicators/)\n- WCAG 2.1: [Understanding Success Criterion 2.4.7: Focus Visible](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/focus-visible.html)\n\n## Formal definition\n| [Initial value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/initial_value) | as each of the properties of the shorthand:<br>- [`outline-width`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/outline-width): `medium`<br>- [`outline-style`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/outline-style): `none`<br>- [`outline-color`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/outline-color): `auto` |\n| Applies to | all elements |\n| [Inherited](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/Inheritance) | no |\n| [Computed value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade/computed_value) | as each of the properties of the shorthand:<br>- [`outline-width`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/outline-width): an absolute length; if the keyword `none` is specified, the computed value is `0`<br>- [`outline-style`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/outline-style): as specified<br>- [`outline-color`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/outline-color): For the keyword `auto`, the computed value is `currentcolor`.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"HTMLElement\"?\n\nAssistant: The HTMLElement interface represents any HTML element. Some elements directly implement this interface, while others implement it via an interface that inherits it.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Instance properties\nAlso inherits properties from its parent, Element.\n\nHTMLElement.accessKey\n\nA string representing the access key assigned to the element.\n\nHTMLElement.accessKeyLabel Read only\n\nReturns a string containing the element's assigned access key.\n\nHTMLElement.anchorElement Read onlyNon-standardExperimental\n\nReturns a reference to the element's anchor element, or null if it doesn't have one.\n\nHTMLElement.attributeStyleMap Read only\n\nA StylePropertyMap representing the declarations of the element's style attribute.\n\nHTMLElement.autocapitalize\n\nA string that represents the element's capitalization behavior for user input. Valid values are: none, off, on, characters, words, sentences.\n\nHTMLElement.autofocus\n\nA boolean value reflecting the autofocus HTML global attribute, which indicates whether the control should be focused when the page loads, or when dialog or popover become shown if specified in an element inside <dialog> elements or elements whose popover attribute is set.\n\nHTMLElement.autocorrect\n\nA boolean that represents whether or not text input by a user should be automatically corrected. This reflects the autocorrect HTML global attribute.\n\nHTMLElement.contentEditable\n\nA string, where a value of true means the element is editable and a value of false means it isn't.\n\nHTMLElement.dataset Read only\n\nReturns a DOMStringMap with which script can read and write the element's custom data attributes (data-*).\n\nHTMLElement.dir\n\nA string, reflecting the dir global attribute, representing the directionality of the element. Possible values are \"ltr\", \"rtl\", and \"auto\".\n\nHTMLElement.draggable\n\nA boolean value indicating if the element can be dragged.\n\nHTMLElement.editContext Experimental\n\nReturns the EditContext associated with the element, or null if there isn't one.\n\nHTMLElement.enterKeyHint\n\nA string defining what action label (or icon) to present for the enter key on virtual keyboards.\n\nHTMLElement.hidden\n\nA string or boolean value reflecting the value of the element's hidden attribute.\n\nHTMLElement.inert\n\nA boolean value indicating whether the user agent must act as though the given node is absent for the purposes of user interaction events, in-page text searches (\"find in page\"), and text selection.\n\nHTMLElement.innerText\n\nRepresents the rendered text content of a node and its descendants. As a getter, it approximates the text the user would get if they highlighted the contents of the element with the cursor and then copied it to the clipboard. As a setter, it replaces the content inside the selected element, converting any line breaks into <br> elements.\n\nHTMLElement.inputMode\n\nA string value reflecting the value of the element's inputmode attribute.\n\nHTMLElement.isContentEditable Read only\n\nReturns a boolean value indicating whether or not the content of the element can be edited.\n\nHTMLElement.lang\n\nA string representing the language of an element's attributes, text, and element contents.\n\nHTMLElement.nonce\n\nReturns the cryptographic number used once that is used by Content Security Policy to determine whether a given fetch will be allowed to proceed.\n\nHTMLElement.offsetHeight Read only\n\nReturns a double containing the height of an element, relative to the layout.\n\nHTMLElement.offsetLeft Read only\n\nReturns a double, the distance from this element's left border to its offsetParent's left border.\n\nHTMLElement.offsetParent Read only\n\nAn Element that is the element from which all offset calculations are currently computed.\n\nHTMLElement.offsetTop Read only\n\nReturns a double, the distance from this element's top border to its offsetParent's top border.\n\nHTMLElement.offsetWidth Read only\n\nReturns a double containing the width of an element, relative to the layout.\n\nHTMLElement.outerText\n\nRepresents the rendered text content of a node and its descendants. As a getter, it is the same as HTMLElement.innerText (it represents the rendered text content of an element and its descendants). As a setter, it replaces the selected node and its contents with the given value, converting any line breaks into <br> elements.\n\nHTMLElement.popover\n\nGets and sets an element's popover state via JavaScript (\"auto\", \"hint\", or \"manual\"), and can be used for feature detection. Reflects the value of the popover global HTML attribute.\n\nHTMLElement.spellcheck\n\nA boolean value that controls the spell-checking hint. It is available on all HTML elements, though it doesn't affect all of them.\n\nHTMLElement.style\n\nA CSSStyleDeclaration representing the declarations of the element's style attribute.\n\nHTMLElement.tabIndex\n\nA long representing the position of the element in the tabbing order.\n\nHTMLElement.title\n\nA string containing the text that appears in a popup box when mouse is over the element.\n\nHTMLElement.translate\n\nA boolean value representing the translation.\n\nHTMLElement.virtualKeyboardPolicy Experimental\n\nA string indicating the on-screen virtual keyboard behavior on devices such as tablets, mobile phones, or other devices where a hardware keyboard may not be available, if the element's content is editable (for example, it is an <input> or <textarea> element, or an element with the contenteditable attribute set).\n\nHTMLElement.writingSuggestions\n\nA string indicating if browser-provided writing suggestions should be enabled under the scope of the element or not.\n\n## Instance methods\nAlso inherits methods from its parent, Element.\n\nHTMLElement.attachInternals()\n\nReturns an ElementInternals object, and enables a custom element to participate in HTML forms.\n\nHTMLElement.blur()\n\nRemoves keyboard focus from the currently focused element.\n\nHTMLElement.click()\n\nSends a mouse click event to the element.\n\nHTMLElement.focus()\n\nMakes the element the current keyboard focus.\n\nHTMLElement.hidePopover()\n\nHides a popover element by removing it from the top layer and styling it with display: none.\n\nHTMLElement.showPopover()\n\nShows a popover element by adding it to the top layer and removing display: none; from its styles.\n\nHTMLElement.togglePopover()\n\nToggles a popover element between the hidden and showing states.\n\n## Events\nListen to these events using addEventListener() or by assigning an event listener to the oneventname property of this interface.\n\nAlso, inherits events from its parent, Element.\n\ncancel\n\nFired for <input> and <dialog> elements when the user cancels the currently open dialog by closing it with the Esc key.\n\nchange\n\nFired when the value of an <input>, <select>, or <textarea> element has been changed and committed by the user. Unlike the input event, the change event is not necessarily fired for each alteration to an element's value.\n\nerror\n\nFired when a resource failed to load, or can't be used.\n\nload\n\nFires for elements containing a resource when the resource has successfully loaded.\n\nClipboard events\n\ncopy\n\nFired when the user initiates a copy action through the browser's user interface.\n\ncut\n\nFired when the user initiates a cut action through the browser's user interface.\n\npaste\n\nFired when the user initiates a paste action through the browser's user interface.\n\nDrag & drop events\ndrag\n\nThis event is fired when an element or text selection is being dragged.\n\ndragend\n\nThis event is fired when a drag operation is being ended (by releasing a mouse button or hitting the escape key).\n\ndragenter\n\nThis event is fired when a dragged element or text selection enters a valid drop target.\n\ndragleave\n\nThis event is fired when a dragged element or text selection leaves a valid drop target.\n\ndragover\n\nThis event is fired continuously when an element or text selection is being dragged and the mouse pointer is over a valid drop target (every 50 ms WHEN mouse is not moving ELSE much faster between 5 ms (slow movement) and 1ms (fast movement) approximately. This firing pattern is different than mouseover).\n\ndragstart\n\nThis event is fired when the user starts dragging an element or text selection.\n\ndrop\n\nThis event is fired when an element or text selection is dropped on a valid drop target.\n\nToggle events\n\nbeforetoggle\n\nFired when the element is a popover or <dialog>, before it is hidden or shown.\n\ntoggle\n\nFired when the element is a popover, <dialog>, or <details> element, just after it is hidden or shown.\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| HTML# htmlelement |\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement", "title": "HTMLElement", "description": "The HTMLElement interface represents any HTML element.

It consists of key/value pairs, where keys are strings and values can be strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, or null.\n\n## Data Types in JSON\nThe data types supported in JSON include:\n1. String\n2. Number\n3. Object\n4. Array\n5. Boolean\n6. Null\n\n## Best Practices\nWhen working with JSON, consider the following best practices:\n- Use consistent naming conventions for keys.\n- Keep the structure simple and avoid deeply nested objects.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/Themes/Theme_concepts", "title": "Understanding JSON Structure", "description": "This page provides an overview of JSON structure, including its syntax, data types, and best practices for usage.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 4, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 01:49:21", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:site_name": "Firefox Extension Workshop", "ogSiteName": "Firefox Extension Workshop", "language": "en", "description": "Get help creating & publishing Firefox extensions.", "og:locale": "en_US", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og:description": "Get help creating & publishing Firefox extensions.", "og:title": "Themes", "publishedTime": "2025-02-20T20:18:31.844Z", "article:published_time": "2025-02-20T20:18:31.844Z", "og:url": "https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/themes/", "ogTitle": "Themes", "ogUrl": "https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/themes/", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/assets/img/favicon.6119d485.png", "ogLocale": "en_US", "ogDescription": "Get help creating & publishing Firefox extensions.", "title": "Themes | Firefox Extension Workshop", "scrapeId": "2e4eac1e-7ff7-41b2-bd66-b4376ae1b631", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/Themes/Theme_concepts", "url": "https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/themes/", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"MutationObserver\"?\n\nAssistant: The MutationObserver interface provides the ability to watch for changes being made to the DOM tree. It is designed as a replacement for the older Mutation Events feature, which was part of the DOM3 Events specification.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Constructor\nCreates and returns a new `MutationObserver` which will invoke a specified callback function when DOM changes occur.\n\n## Instance methods\n- `disconnect()`: Stops the `MutationObserver` instance from receiving further notifications until and unless `observe()` is called again.\n- `observe()`: Configures the `MutationObserver` to begin receiving notifications through its callback function when DOM changes matching the given options occur.\n- `takeRecords()`: Removes all pending notifications from the `MutationObserver`'s notification queue and returns them in a new `Array` of `MutationRecord` objects.\n\n## Mutation Observer & customize resize event listener & demo\n[Demo Link](https://codepen.io/milofultz/pen/LYjPXPw)\n\n## Example\nThe following example was adapted from [this blog post](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/05/dom-mutationobserver-reacting-to-dom-changes-without-killing-browser-performance/).\n\n```javascript\n// Select the node that will be observed for mutations\nconst targetNode = document.getElementById(\"some-id\");\n\n// Options for the observer (which mutations to observe)\nconst config = { attributes: true, childList: true, subtree: true };\n\n// Callback function to execute when mutations are observed\nconst callback = (mutationList, observer) => {\n  for (const mutation of mutationList) {\n    if (mutation.type === \"childList\") {\n      console.log(\"A child node has been added or removed.\");\n    } else if (mutation.type === \"attributes\") {\n      console.log(`The ${mutation.attributeName} attribute was modified.`);\n    }\n  }\n};\n\n// Create an observer instance linked to the callback function\nconst observer = new MutationObserver(callback);\n\n// Start observing the target node for configured mutations\nobserver.observe(targetNode, config);\n\n// Later, you can stop observing\nobserver.disconnect();\n```\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [DOM<br>#

A render bundle is encoded using the following function:\n\n```javascript\nfunction recordRenderPass(\n  passEncoder: GPURenderBundleEncoder | GPURenderPassEncoder\n) {\n  if (settings.dynamicOffsets) {\n    passEncoder.setPipeline(dynamicPipeline);\n  } else {\n    passEncoder.setPipeline(pipeline);\n  }\n  passEncoder.setVertexBuffer(0, vertexBuffer);\n  passEncoder.setBindGroup(0, timeBindGroup);\n  const dynamicOffsets = [0];\n  for (let i = 0; i < numTriangles; ++i) {\n    if (settings.dynamicOffsets) {\n      dynamicOffsets[0] = i * alignedUniformBytes;\n      passEncoder.setBindGroup(1, dynamicBindGroup, dynamicOffsets);\n    } else {\n      passEncoder.setBindGroup(1, bindGroups[i]);\n    }\n    passEncoder.draw(3, 1, 0, 0);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nLater on, a GPURenderBundleEncoder is created, the function is invoked, and the render bundle is recorded using GPURenderBundleEncoder.finish():\n\n```javascript\nconst renderBundleEncoder = device.createRenderBundleEncoder({\n  colorFormats: [presentationFormat],\n});\nrecordRenderPass(renderBundleEncoder);\nconst renderBundle = renderBundleEncoder.finish();\n```\n\nGPURenderPassEncoder.executeBundles() is then used to reuse the work across multiple render passes to improve performance.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Compute Pressure API\"?\n\nAssistant: The Compute Pressure API is a JavaScript API that enables you to observe the pressure of system resources such as the CPU.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Use cases\nIn real-time applications, such as video conferencing web apps, the Compute Pressure API lets you detect which pressure the system is currently facing. The system will handle any stress as well as it can, but a collaboration between system and app is useful to handle the pressure best. This API notifies you of high-level pressure state changes, so you can adjust your workloads and still offer a pleasant user experience. The signal is proactively delivered when the system pressure trend is either rising or easing to allow timely adaptation.\n\nYou can use these pressure change signals, for example, to reduce or increase the video quality or the number of video feeds shown simultaneously to avoid dropping video frames, audio cuts, or delaying other critical parts of the application. The quality of service of your web app can vary, also due to pressure from external factors and apps at unexpected times, but ideally that does not lead to a total system failure, input delay, or unresponsiveness. Instead, the set of enabled features and their quality level is balanced against the resource pressure of the end-user device. It is similar to network pressure in which case a streaming app adapts to the available bandwidth.\n\nMore use cases are:\n\n- Web games, for which you could balance the quality and amount of 3D assets, change the framerate, resolution, depth of field etc., to ensure low latency and stable frame rate.\n- User interfaces, for which you could render placeholders instead of real data while the system is under pressure, and render the real content once the pressure has eased.\n\n## Concepts and usage\nFast and delightful web applications should balance workloads when the system's computing resources are used at (near) full capacity. The Compute Pressure API's goal is to prevent, rather than mitigate, bad user experience in the web app itself and also for the user's device to not become too hot, too loud, or to drain the battery at an unacceptable rate. Therefore, it is advised to prefer this API over feedback mechanisms or singular performance adjustments (for example, by lowering the frequency of `window.requestAnimationFrame`) where bad user experience might be mitigated, but not proactively avoided. For measuring and segmenting the performance of user sessions after the fact, the `PerformanceLongTaskTiming` API is better suited to analyze tasks that occupy the UI thread for 50 milliseconds or more (see also Performance API for additional performance measurement APIs).\n\n## Pressure source types\nIn your web app or website, different tasks are fighting for the processing time of different processing units (CPU, GPU, and other specialized processing units). The current version of the Compute Pressure API specification defines two main source types that can be queried to gather pressure information:\n\n- \"thermals\" represents the global thermal state of the entire system.\n- \"cpu\" represents the average pressure of the central processing unit (CPU) across all its cores. This state can be affected by other apps and sites than the observing site.\n\nThe list of supported sources varies per browser, operating system, and hardware, and is evolving. Use the static `PressureObserver.knownSources` hint to see which source types are available to your browser. Note that availability can also vary by your operating system and your hardware. Call `observe()` and check for a `NotSupportedError` to see if pressure observation is possible.\n\nThe Compute Pressure API is available in the following contexts:\n\n- `Window` (main thread)\n- `Worker`\n- `SharedWorker`\n- `<iFrame>` (if a suitable Permissions-Policy is provided)\n\n## Pressure states\nThe Compute Pressure API exposes high-level pressure states which abstract away complexities of system bottlenecks that cannot be adequately explained with low-level metrics such as processor clock speed and utilization. In fact, metrics for CPU utilization are often misleading. Therefore, the Compute Pressure API uses human-readable pressure states with the following semantics:\n\n- ⚪ \"nominal\": The conditions of the target device are at an acceptable level with no noticeable adverse effects on the user.\n- 🟢 \"fair\": Target device pressure, temperature and/or energy usage are slightly elevated, potentially resulting in reduced battery-life, as well as fans (or systems with fans) becoming active and audible. Apart from that the target device is running flawlessly and can take on additional work.\n- 🟡 \"serious\": Target device pressure, temperature and/or energy usage is consistently highly elevated. The system may be throttling as a countermeasure to reduce thermals.\n- 🔴 \"critical\": The temperature of the target device or system is significantly elevated and it requires cooling down to avoid any potential issues.\n\nThe contributing factors (that is, the underlying system metrics) for the pressure states above are not defined by the specification and can vary depending on the underlying hardware and platform behavior. However, the specification requires that the change in contributing factors must be substantial to avoid flip-flopping between states. This means you can expect the API to not report different states overly often as they aren't responding to just one fluctuating system metric.\n\n## Security and privacy considerations\nThe Compute Pressure API is policy-controlled by the \"compute-pressure\" directive. Its default allowlist is 'self' which allows usage in same-origin nested frames but prevents third-party content from using the feature.\n\n## Reference\nThe following interfaces are present in the Compute Pressure API and the API surface is similar to other observers, such as `IntersectionObserver`, `MutationObserver`, or `PerformanceObserver`.\n\n`PressureObserver` Experimental\n\nNotifies when the system's pressure changes for a specified number of sources (e.g. the CPU) at a predefined sample interval.\n\n`PressureRecord`\n\nDescribes the pressure trend at a specific moment of transition.\n\n## Permission-Policy directive\n`Permissions-Policy`; the `compute-pressure` directive\n\nControls access to the Compute Pressure API.\n\n## Examples\nThis example creates a `PressureObserver` and takes action whenever there is a pressure change. The sample interval is set to 1000ms, meaning that there will be updates at most every second.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Compute_Pressure_API", "title": "Compute Pressure API", "description": "The Compute Pressure API is a JavaScript API that enables you to observe the pressure of system resources such as the CPU.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 8, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 01:57:00", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:image:width": "1920", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Compute_Pressure_API", "og:type": "website", "description": "The Compute Pressure API is a JavaScript API that enables you to observe the pressure of system resources such as the CPU.", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:title": "Compute Pressure API - Web APIs | MDN", "og:image:height": "1080", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "language": "en-US", "position": ["1", "2", "3"], "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "ogTitle": "Compute Pressure API - Web APIs | MDN", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Compute_Pressure_API", "og:description": "The Compute Pressure API is a JavaScript API that enables you to observe the pressure of system resources such as the CPU.", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "ogDescription": "The Compute Pressure API is a JavaScript API that enables you to observe the pressure of system resources such as the CPU.", "ogLocale": "en_US", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "og:locale": "en_US", "og:image:type": "image/png", "title": "Compute Pressure API - Web APIs | MDN", "scrapeId": "9e8394c0-44f2-4933-a36e-d06eeb5cb25f", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Compute_Pressure_API", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Compute_Pressure_API", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"FencedFrameConfig\"?\n\nAssistant: The FencedFrameConfig interface represents the navigation of a <fencedframe>, i.e. what content will be displayed in it.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Instance methods\nsetSharedStorageContext() Experimental\n\nPasses in data from the embedding document to the <fencedframe>'s shared storage.\n\n## Examples\n### Basic usage\nTo set what content will be shown in a <fencedframe>, a utilizing API (such as Protected Audience or Shared Storage) generates a FencedFrameConfig object, which is then set as the value of the <fencedframe>'s config property.\n\nThe following example gets a FencedFrameConfig from a Protected Audience API's ad auction, which is then used to display the winning ad in a <fencedframe>:\n\n```javascript\nconst frameConfig = await navigator.runAdAuction({\n  // ...auction configuration\n  resolveToConfig: true,\n});\n\nconst frame = document.createElement(\"fencedframe\");\nframe.config = frameConfig;\n```\n\n**Note:** `resolveToConfig: true` must be passed in to the `runAdAuction()` call to obtain a `FencedFrameConfig` object. If it is not set, the resulting Promise will resolve to a URN that can only be used in an <iframe>.\n\n### Passing contextual data via `setSharedStorageContext()`\nYou can use the Private Aggregation API to create reports that combine event-level data inside fenced frames with contextual data from the embedding document. `setSharedStorageContext()` can be used to pass contextual data from the embedder to shared storage worklets initiated by the Protected Audience API.\n\nIn the following example, we store data from both the embedding page and the fenced frame in shared storage.\n\nIn the embedding page, we will set a mock event ID as the shared storage context using `setSharedStorageContext()`:\n\n```javascript\nconst frameConfig = await navigator.runAdAuction({ resolveToConfig: true });\n\n// Data from the embedder that you want to pass to the shared storage worklet\nframeConfig.setSharedStorageContext(\"some-event-id\");\n\nconst frame = document.createElement(\"fencedframe\");\nframe.config = frameConfig;\n```\n\nInside the fenced frame, we add the worklet module with `window.sharedStorage.worklet.addModule()`, and then send the event-level data into the shared storage worklet using `window.sharedStorage.run()` (this is unrelated to the contextual data from the embedding document):\n\n```javascript\nconst frameData = {\n  // Data available only inside the fenced frame\n};\n\nawait window.sharedStorage.worklet.addModule(\"reporting-worklet.js\");\n\nawait window.sharedStorage.run(\"send-report\", {\n  data: {\n    frameData,\n  },\n});\n```\n\nIn the `reporting-worklet.js` worklet, we read the embedding document's event ID from `sharedStorage.context` and the frame's event-level data from the data object, then report them through Private Aggregation:\n\n```javascript\nclass ReportingOperation {\n  convertEventIdToBucket(eventId) { ... }\n  convertEventPayloadToValue(info) { ... }\n\n  async run(data) {\n    // Data from the embedder\n    const eventId = sharedStorage.context;\n\n    // Data from the fenced frame\n    const eventPayload = data.frameData;\n\n    privateAggregation.sendHistogramReport({\n      bucket: convertEventIdToBucket(eventId),\n      value: convertEventPayloadToValue(eventPayload)\n    });\n  }\n}\n\nregister('send-report', ReportingOperation);\n```\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FencedFrameConfig", "title": "FencedFrameConfig", "description": "The FencedFrameConfig interface represents the navigation of a <fencedframe>, i.e. what content will be displayed in it.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 2, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 01:57:18", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:image:width": "1920", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "og:type": "website", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "position": ["1", "2", "3"], "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "title": "FencedFrameConfig - Web APIs | MDN", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FencedFrameConfig", "og:description": "The FencedFrameConfig interface represents the navigation of a <fencedframe>, i.e. what content will be displayed in it.", "language": "en-US", "ogTitle": "FencedFrameConfig - Web APIs | MDN", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "ogLocale": "en_US", "ogDescription": "The FencedFrameConfig interface represents the navigation of a <fencedframe>, i.e. what content will be displayed in it.", "og:title": "FencedFrameConfig - Web APIs | MDN", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:image:type": "image/png", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FencedFrameConfig", "description": "Learn about the FencedFrameConfig interface, including its methods, code examples, specifications, and browser compatibility.", "og:locale": "en_US", "og:image:height": "1080", "scrapeId": "27b331f9-fec1-4b55-94dc-523c0f862b5d", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FencedFrameConfig", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FencedFrameConfig", "statusCode": 200}}}

We'll also introduce the `async` and `await` keywords.\n\nImplementing a promise-based API\nThis article will outline how to implement your own promise-based API.\n\nIntroducing workers\nWorkers enable you to run certain tasks in a separate thread to keep your main code responsive. In this article, we'll rewrite a long-running synchronous function to use a worker.\n\nSequencing animations Challenge\nThis challenge asks you to use promises to play a set of animations in a particular sequence.\n\n## See also\n- Asynchronous Programming from the fantastic Eloquent JavaScript online book by Marijn Haverbeke.\n- Overview: Extension modules\n- Next\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Async_JS", "title": "Asynchronous JavaScript", "description": "In this module, we take a look at asynchronous JavaScript, why it is important, and how it can be used to effectively handle potential blocking operations, such as fetching resources from a server.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 3, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 01:57:40", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:image:height": "1080", "ogDescription": "In this module, we take a look at asynchronous JavaScript, why it is important, and how it can be used to effectively handle potential blocking operations, such as fetching resources from a server.", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "position": ["1", "2", "3"], "og:type": "website", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Async_JS", "og:image:width": "1920", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "In this module, we take a look at asynchronous JavaScript, why it is important, and how it can be used to effectively handle potential blocking operations, such as fetching resources from a server.", "og:locale": "en_US", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "og:title": "Asynchronous JavaScript - Learn web development | MDN", "og:image:type": "image/png", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "ogLocale": "en_US", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Async_JS", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "title": "Asynchronous JavaScript - Learn web development | MDN", "language": "en-US", "og:description": "In this module, we take a look at asynchronous JavaScript, why it is important, and how it can be used to effectively handle potential blocking operations, such as fetching resources from a server.", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "ogTitle": "Asynchronous JavaScript - Learn web development | MDN", "scrapeId": "91dc4f52-278d-4f64-ab70-8593139cff5b", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Async_JS", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Async_JS", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"KeyboardEvent\"?\n\nAssistant: `KeyboardEvent` objects describe a user interaction with the keyboard; each event describes a single interaction between the user and a key (or combination of a key with modifier keys) on the keyboard.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Constructor\n`KeyboardEvent()` creates a new `KeyboardEvent` object.\n\n## Constants\nThe `KeyboardEvent` interface defines the following constants.\n\n### Keyboard locations\nThe following constants identify which part of the keyboard the key event originates from. They are accessed as `KeyboardEvent.DOM_KEY_LOCATION_STANDARD` and so forth.\n\n| Constant | Value | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `DOM_KEY_LOCATION_STANDARD` | 0x00 | The key described by the event is not identified as being located in a particular area of the keyboard; it is not located on the numeric keypad (unless it's the NumLock key), and for keys that are duplicated on the left and right sides of the keyboard, the key is, for whatever reason, not to be associated with that location. Examples include alphanumeric keys on the standard PC 101 US keyboard, the NumLock key, and the space bar. |\n| `DOM_KEY_LOCATION_LEFT` | 0x01 | The key is one which may exist in multiple locations on the keyboard and, in this instance, is on the left side of the keyboard. Examples include the left Control key, the left Command key on a Macintosh keyboard, or the left Shift key. |\n| `DOM_KEY_LOCATION_RIGHT` | 0x02 | The key is one which may exist in multiple positions on the keyboard and, in this case, is located on the right side of the keyboard. Examples include the right Shift key and the right Alt key (Option on a Mac keyboard). |\n| `DOM_KEY_LOCATION_NUMPAD` | 0x03 | The key is located on the numeric keypad, or is a virtual key associated with the numeric keypad if there's more than one place the key could originate from. The NumLock key does not fall into this group and is always encoded with the location `DOM_KEY_LOCATION_STANDARD`. Examples include the digits on the numeric keypad, the keypad's Enter key, and the decimal point on the keypad.\n\n## Instance properties\nThis interface also inherits properties of its parents, `UIEvent` and `Event`.\n\n- `KeyboardEvent.altKey` Read only: Returns a boolean value that is `true` if the `Alt` ( `Option` or `⌥` on macOS) key was active when the key event was generated.\n- `KeyboardEvent.code` Read only: Returns a string with the code value of the physical key represented by the event. **Warning:** This ignores the user's keyboard layout, so that if the user presses the key at the \"Y\" position in a QWERTY keyboard layout, this will always return \"KeyY\".\n- `KeyboardEvent.ctrlKey` Read only: Returns a boolean value that is `true` if the `Ctrl` key was active when the key event was generated.\n- `KeyboardEvent.isComposing` Read only: Returns a boolean value that is `true` if the event is fired between after `compositionstart` and before `compositionend`.\n- `KeyboardEvent.key` Read only: Returns a string representing the key value of the key represented by the event.\n- `KeyboardEvent.location` Read only: Returns a number representing the location of the key on the keyboard or other input device.\n- `KeyboardEvent.metaKey` Read only: Returns a boolean value that is `true` if the `Meta` key was active when the key event was generated.\n- `KeyboardEvent.repeat` Read only: Returns a boolean value that is `true` if the key is being held down such that it is automatically repeating.\n- `KeyboardEvent.shiftKey` Read only: Returns a boolean value that is `true` if the `Shift` key was active when the key event was generated.\n\n## Obsolete properties\n- `KeyboardEvent.charCode` Deprecated Read only: Returns a number representing the Unicode reference number of the key; this property is used only by the `keypress` event.\n- `KeyboardEvent.keyCode` Deprecated Read only: Returns a number representing a system and implementation dependent numerical code identifying the unmodified value of the pressed key.\n- `KeyboardEvent.keyIdentifier` Non-standard Deprecated Read only: This property is non-standard and has been deprecated in favor of `KeyboardEvent.key`.\n\n## Instance methods\nThis interface also inherits methods of its parents, `UIEvent` and `Event`.\n\n- `KeyboardEvent.getModifierState()`: Returns a boolean value indicating if a modifier key such as `Alt`, `Shift`, `Ctrl`, or `Meta`, was pressed when the event was created.\n\n## Obsolete methods\n- `KeyboardEvent.initKeyEvent()`: Deprecated. Initializes a `KeyboardEvent` object. This was implemented only by Firefox.\n- `KeyboardEvent.initKeyboardEvent()`: Deprecated. Initializes a `KeyboardEvent` object.\n\n## Events\nThe following events are based on the `KeyboardEvent` type. Each event links to the documentation for the `Element` handler for the event.\n\n- `keydown`: A key has been pressed.\n- `keyup`: A key has been released.\n\n## Obsolete events\n- `keypress`: Deprecated. A key that normally produces a character value has been pressed.\n\n## Usage notes\nThere are three types of keyboard events: `keydown`, `keypress`, and `keyup`. For most keys, Gecko dispatches a sequence of key events like this:\n1. When the key is first pressed, the `keydown` event is sent.\n2. If the key is not a modifier key, the `keypress` event is sent.\n3. When the user releases the key, the `keyup` event is sent.\n\n## Special cases\nSome keys toggle the state of an indicator light; these include keys such as Caps Lock, Num Lock, and Scroll Lock. On Windows and Linux, these keys dispatch only the `keydown` and `keyup` events.\n\n## Auto-repeat handling\nWhen a key is pressed and held down, it begins to auto-repeat. This results in a sequence of events similar to the following being dispatched:\n1. `keydown`\n2. `keypress`\n3. `keydown`\n4. `keypress`\n5. <<repeating until the user releases the key>>\n6. `keyup`.\n\n## Example\n```javascript\ndocument.addEventListener(\n  \"keydown\",\n  (event) => {\n    const keyName = event.key;\n\n    if (keyName === \"Control\") {\n      return;\n    }\n\n    if (event.ctrlKey) {\n      alert(`Combination of ctrlKey + ${keyName}`);\n    } else {\n      alert(`Key pressed ${keyName}`);\n    }\n  },\n  false,\n);\n\ndocument.addEventListener(\n  \"keyup\",\n  (event) => {\n    const keyName = event.key;\n\n    if (keyName === \"Control\") {\n      alert(\"Control key was released\");\n    }\n  },\n  false,\n);\n```\n\n## Specifications\nThe `KeyboardEvent` interface specification went through numerous draft versions, first under DOM Events Level 2 where it was dropped as no consensus arose, then under DOM Events Level 3.\n\n## Browser compatibility\nAs of Firefox 65, the `keypress` event is no longer fired for non-printable keys, except for the `Enter` key.\n\n## See also\n- `KeyboardEvent.code`\n- `KeyboardEvent.key`\n- `KeyboardEvent.getModifierState()`\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent", "title": "KeyboardEvent", "description": "`KeyboardEvent` objects describe a user interaction with the keyboard; each event describes a single interaction between the user and a key (or combination of a key with modifier keys) on the keyboard.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 15, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 01:58:41", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"ogLocale": "en_US", "og:image:type": "image/png", "position": ["1", "2", "3"], "og:locale": "en_US", "og:title": "KeyboardEvent - Web APIs | MDN", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent", "og:image:height": "1080", "og:image:width": "1920", "ogDescription": "KeyboardEvent objects describe a user interaction with the keyboard; each event describes a single interaction between the user and a key (or combination of a key with modifier keys) on the keyboard.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"EXSLT\"?\n\nAssistant: EXSLT is a set of extensions to XSLT. There are a number of modules; those that are supported by Firefox are listed below:\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## EXSLT modules\nTo use an EXSLT function, you need to declare the namespace the function is in, and then use the appropriate prefix when calling the function. For example, to use the regular expressions package:\n\n```xml\n<xsl:stylesheet version=\"1.0\"\n                xmlns:xsl=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform\"\n                xmlns:regexp=\"http://exslt.org/regular-expressions\">\n  <xsl:template match=\"/\">\n    …\n    <xsl:value-of select=\"regexp:replace(/root/@value, 'before', 'gi', 'AFTER')\"/>\n    …\n  </xsl:template>\n\n</xsl:stylesheet>\n```\n\n## Common\nThe EXSLT Common package provides basic functions that expand upon the capabilities of XSLT. The namespace for the Common package is `http://exslt.org/common`.\n\n#### Functions\n\n- [`exsl:node-set()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XML/EXSLT/Reference/exsl/node-set)\n- [`exsl:object-type()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XML/EXSLT/Reference/exsl/object-type)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XML/EXSLT", "title": "EXSLT", "description": "EXSLT is a set of extensions to XSLT.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"AudioWorkletGlobalScope\"?\n\nAssistant: The AudioWorkletGlobalScope interface of the Web Audio API represents a global execution context for user-supplied code, which defines custom AudioWorkletProcessor-derived classes.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Instance properties\nThis interface also inherits properties defined on its parent interface, WorkletGlobalScope.\n\ncurrentFrame Read only\n\nReturns an integer that represents the ever-increasing current sample-frame of the audio block being processed. It is incremented by 128 (the size of a render quantum) after the processing of each audio block.\n\ncurrentTime Read only\n\nReturns a double that represents the ever-increasing context time of the audio block being processed. It is equal to the currentTime property of the BaseAudioContext the worklet belongs to.\n\nsampleRate Read only\n\nReturns a float that represents the sample rate of the associated BaseAudioContext.\n\n## Instance methods\nThis interface also inherits methods defined on its parent interface, WorkletGlobalScope.\n\nregisterProcessor()\n\nRegisters a class derived from the AudioWorkletProcessor interface. The class can then be used by creating an AudioWorkletNode, providing its registered name.\n\n## Examples\nIn this example we output all global properties into the console in the constructor of a custom AudioWorkletProcessor.\n\nFirst we need to define the processor, and register it. Note that this should be done in a separate file.\n\n```javascript\n// AudioWorkletProcessor defined in : test-processor.js\nclass TestProcessor extends AudioWorkletProcessor {\n  constructor() {\n    super();\n\n    // Logs the current sample-frame and time at the moment of instantiation.\n    // They are accessible from the AudioWorkletGlobalScope.\n    console.log(currentFrame);\n    console.log(currentTime);\n  }\n\n  // The process method is required - output silence,\n  // which the outputs are already filled with.\n  process(inputs, outputs, parameters) {\n    return true;\n  }\n}\n\n// Logs the sample rate, that is not going to change ever,\n// because it's a read-only property of a BaseAudioContext\n// and is set only during its instantiation.\nconsole.log(sampleRate);\n\n// You can declare any variables and use them in your processors\n// for example it may be an ArrayBuffer with a wavetable\nconst usefulVariable = 42;\nconsole.log(usefulVariable);\n\nregisterProcessor(\"test-processor\", TestProcessor);\n```\n\nNext, in our main scripts file we'll load the processor, create an instance of AudioWorkletNode — passing the name of the processor to it — and connect the node to an audio graph. We should see the output of console.log() calls in the console:\n\n```javascript\nconst audioContext = new AudioContext();\nawait audioContext.audioWorklet.addModule(\"test-processor.js\");\nconst testNode = new AudioWorkletNode(audioContext, \"test-processor\");\ntestNode.connect(audioContext.destination);\n```\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioWorkletGlobalScope", "title": "AudioWorkletGlobalScope", "description": "The AudioWorkletGlobalScope interface of the Web Audio API represents a global execution context for user-supplied code, which defines custom AudioWorkletProcessor-derived classes.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 3, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 01:59:07", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"title": "AudioWorkletGlobalScope - Web APIs | MDN", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioWorkletGlobalScope", "og:description": "The AudioWorkletGlobalScope interface of the Web Audio API represents a global execution context for user-supplied code, which defines custom AudioWorkletProcessor-derived classes.", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "ogTitle": "AudioWorkletGlobalScope - Web APIs | MDN", "language": "en-US", "og:type": "website", "og:image:height": "1080", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "ogLocale": "en_US", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioWorkletGlobalScope", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:image:type": "image/png", "description": "Learn about the AudioWorkletGlobalScope interface, including its properties and methods, code examples, specifications, and browser compatibility.", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "ogDescription": "The AudioWorkletGlobalScope interface of the Web Audio API represents a global execution context for user-supplied code, which defines custom AudioWorkletProcessor-derived classes.", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "og:title": "AudioWorkletGlobalScope - Web APIs | MDN", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "og:locale": "en_US", "position": ["1", "2", "3"], "og:image:width": "1920", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "scrapeId": "25b59d9b-fa5d-44f1-9844-466df5986905", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioWorkletGlobalScope", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioWorkletGlobalScope", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Understanding Latency\"?\n\nAssistant: This article explains what latency is, how it impacts performance, how to measure latency, and how to reduce it.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## What is Latency?\nLatency is generally considered to be the amount of time it takes from when a request is made by the user to the time it takes for the response to get back to that user. On a first request, for the first 14Kb bytes, latency is longer because it includes a DNS lookup, a TCP handshake, the secure TLS negotiation. Subsequent requests will have less latency because the connection to the server is already set.\n\nLatency describes the amount of delay on a network or Internet connection. Low latency implies that there are no or almost no delays. High latency implies that there are many delays. One of the main aims of improving performance is to reduce latency.\n\nThe latency associated with a single asset, especially a basic HTML page, may seem trivial. But websites generally involve multiple requests: the HTML includes requests for multiple CSS, scripts, and media files. The greater the number and size of these requests, the greater the impact of high latency on user experience.\n\nOn a connection with low latency, requested resources will appear almost immediately. On a connection with high latency, there will be a discernible delay between the time that a request is sent, and the resources are returned. We can determine the amount of latency by measuring the speed with which the data moves from one network location to another.\n\nLatency can be measured one way, for example, the amount of time it takes to send a request for resources, or the length of the entire round-trip from the browser's request for a resource to the moment when the requested resource arrives at the browser.\n\n## Network throttling\nTo emulate the latency of a low bandwidth network, you can use developer tools and switch to a lower end network connection.\n\nIn the developer tools, under the network table, you can switch the throttling option to 2G, 3G, etc. Different browser developer tools have different preset options, the characteristics emulated include download speed, upload speed, and minimum latency, or the minimum amount of time it takes to send a packet of data. The approximate values of some presets include:\n\n| Selection | Download speed | Upload speed | Minimum latency (ms) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GPRS | 50 kbps | 20 kbps | 500 |\n| Regular 2G | 250 kbps | 50 kbps | 300 |\n| Good 2G | 450 kbps | 150 kbps | 150 |\n| Regular 3G | 750 kbps | 250 kbps | 100 |\n| Good 3G | 1.5 Mbps | 750 kbps | 40 |\n| Regular 4G/LTE | 4 Mbps | 3 Mbps | 20 |\n| DSL | 2 Mbps | 1 Mbps | 5 |\n| Wi-Fi | 30 Mbps | 15 Mbps | 2 |\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Understanding_latency", "title": "Understanding Latency", "description": "This article explains what latency is, how it impacts performance, how to measure latency, and how to reduce it.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 2, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 01:59:19", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "language": "en-US", "ogDescription": "Latency is the time it takes for a packet of data to travel from source to a destination.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Blob\"?\n\nAssistant: The Blob interface represents a blob, which is a file-like object of immutable, raw data; they can be read as text or binary data, or converted into a ReadableStream so its methods can be used for processing the data.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Using blobs\nTo construct a Blob from other non-blob objects and data, use the Blob() constructor. To create a blob that contains a subset of another blob's data, use the slice() method. To obtain a Blob object for a file on the user's file system, see the File documentation.\n\n## Constructor\nBlob()\n\nReturns a newly created Blob object which contains a concatenation of all of the data in the array passed into the constructor.\n\n## Instance properties\nBlob.size Read only\n\nThe size, in bytes, of the data contained in the Blob object.\n\nBlob.type Read only\n\nA string indicating the MIME type of the data contained in the Blob. If the type is unknown, this string is empty.\n\n## Instance methods\nBlob.arrayBuffer()\n\nReturns a promise that resolves with an ArrayBuffer containing the entire contents of the Blob as binary data.\n\nBlob.bytes()\n\nReturns a promise that resolves with an Uint8Array containing the contents of the Blob.\n\nBlob.slice()\n\nReturns a new Blob object containing the data in the specified range of bytes of the blob on which it's called.\n\nBlob.stream()\n\nReturns a ReadableStream that can be used to read the contents of the Blob.\n\nBlob.text()\n\nReturns a promise that resolves with a string containing the entire contents of the Blob interpreted as UTF-8 text.\n\n## Examples\n### Creating a blob\nThe Blob() constructor can create blobs from other objects. For example, to construct a blob from a JSON string:\n\n```javascript\nconst obj = { hello: \"world\" };\nconst blob = new Blob([JSON.stringify(obj, null, 2)], {\n  type: \"application/json\",\n});\n```\n\n### Creating a URL representing the contents of a typed array\nThe following example creates a JavaScript typed array and creates a new Blob containing the typed array's data. It then calls URL.createObjectURL() to convert the blob into a URL.\n\n```html\n<p>\n  This example creates a typed array containing the ASCII codes for the space\n  character through the letter Z, then converts it to an object URL. A link to\n  open that object URL is created. Click the link to see the decoded object URL.\n</p>\n```\n\nThe main piece of this code for example purposes is the typedArrayToURL() function, which creates a Blob from the given typed array and returns an object URL for it. Having converted the data into an object URL, it can be used in a number of ways, including as the value of the <img> element's src attribute (assuming the data contains an image, of course).\n\n```javascript\nfunction showViewLiveResultButton() {\n  if (window.self !== window.top) {\n    const p = document.querySelector(\"p\");\n    p.textContent = \"\";\n    const button = document.createElement(\"button\");\n    button.textContent = \"View live result of the example code above\";\n    p.append(button);\n    button.addEventListener(\"click\", () => window.open(location.href));\n    return true;\n  }\n  return false;\n}\n\nif (!showViewLiveResultButton()) {\n  function typedArrayToURL(typedArray, mimeType) {\n    return URL.createObjectURL(\n      new Blob([typedArray.buffer], { type: mimeType }),\n    );\n  }\n  const bytes = new Uint8Array(59);\n\n  for (let i = 0; i < 59; i++) {\n    bytes[i] = 32 + i;\n  }\n\n  const url = typedArrayToURL(bytes, \"text/plain\");\n  const link = document.createElement(\"a\");\n\n  link.href = url;\n  link.innerText = \"Open the array URL\";\n  document.body.appendChild(link);\n}\n```\n\n### Extracting data from a blob\nOne way to read content from a Blob is to use a FileReader. The following code reads the content of a Blob as a typed array:\n\n```javascript\nconst reader = new FileReader();\nreader.addEventListener(\"loadend\", () => {\n  // reader.result contains the contents of blob as a typed array\n});\nreader.readAsArrayBuffer(blob);\n```\n\nAnother way to read content from a Blob is to use a Response. The following code reads the content of a Blob as text:\n\n```javascript\nconst text = await new Response(blob).text();\n```\n\nOr by using Blob.text():\n\n```javascript\nconst text = await blob.text();\n```\n\nBy using other methods of FileReader, it is possible to read the contents of a Blob as a string or a data URL.\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [File API<br># blob-section](https://w3c.github.io/FileAPI/#blob-section) |\n\n## Browser compatibility\n\n\n## See also\n- [FileReader](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader)\n- [File](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File)\n- [URL.createObjectURL()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/createObjectURL_static \"URL.createObjectURL()\")\n- [Using files from web applications](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_API/Using_files_from_web_applications)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob", "title": "Blob", "description": "The Blob interface represents a blob, which is a file-like object of immutable, raw data; they can be read as text or binary data, or converted into a ReadableStream so its methods can be used for processing the data.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 8, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 02:00:00", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "og:description": "The Blob interface represents a blob, which is a file-like object of immutable, raw data; they can be read as text or binary data, or converted into a ReadableStream so its methods can be used for processing the data.", "og:type": "website", "ogDescription": "The Blob interface represents a blob, which is a file-like object of immutable, raw data; they can be read as text or binary data, or converted into a ReadableStream so its methods can be used for processing the data.", "language": "en-US", "ogTitle": "Blob - Web APIs | MDN", "ogLocale": "en_US", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "description": "Learn about the Blob interface, including its constructor, properties, and methods, code examples, specifications, and browser compatibility.", "og:title": "Blob - Web APIs | MDN", "og:locale": "en_US", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:image:height": "1080", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob", "og:image:type": "image/png", "og:image:width": "1920", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Blob - Web APIs | MDN", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "position": ["1", "2", "3"], "scrapeId": "c6388e86-0b90-4d83-b7e7-e3c59fae7a5c", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"@media\"?\n\nAssistant: The @media CSS at-rule can be used to apply part of a style sheet based on the result of one or more media queries. With it, you specify a media query and a block of CSS to apply to the document if and only if the media query matches the device on which the content is being used.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Try it\nCSS Demo: @media\n\nThe interactive example cannot be shown because MathML is not supported by your browser.\n\n## Syntax\nThe @media at-rule may be placed at the top level of your code or nested inside any other conditional group at-rule.\n\n```css\n/* At the top level of your code */\n@media screen and (min-width: 900px) {\n  article {\n    padding: 1rem 3rem;\n  }\n}\n\n/* Nested within another conditional at-rule */\n@supports (display: flex) {\n  @media screen and (min-width: 900px) {\n    article {\n      display: flex;\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Description\nA media query's <media-query-list> includes <media-type>s, <media-feature>s, and logical operators.\n\n## Media types\nA <media-type> describes the general category of a device. Except when using the only logical operator, the media type is optional and the all type is implied.\n\n- all: Suitable for all devices.\n- print: Intended for paged material and documents viewed on a screen in print preview mode.\n- screen: Intended primarily for screens.\n\n## Media features\nA <media feature> describes specific characteristics of the user agent, output device, or environment. Media feature expressions test for their presence, value, or range of values, and are entirely optional. Each media feature expression must be surrounded by parentheses.\n\n## Logical operators\nThe logical operators not, and, only, and or can be used to compose a complex media query. You can also combine multiple media queries into a single rule by separating them with commas.\n\n## User agent client hints\nSome media queries have corresponding user agent client hints. These are HTTP headers that request content that is pre-optimized for the particular media requirement.\n\n## Formal syntax\n```css\n@media =\n  @media <media-query-list> { <rule-list> }\n```\n\n## Accessibility\nTo best accommodate people who adjust a site's text size, use ems when you need a <length> for your media queries. Both em and px are valid units, but em works better if the user changes the browser text size.\n\n## Security\nBecause media queries provide insights into the capabilities—and by extension, the features and design—of the device the user is working with, there is the potential that they could be abused to construct a fingerprint which identifies the device.\n\n## Examples\n### Testing for print and screen media types\n```css\n@media print {\n  body {\n    font-size: 10pt;\n  }\n}\n\n@media screen {\n  body {\n    font-size: 13px;\n  }\n}\n\n@media screen, print {\n  body {\n    line-height: 1.2;\n  }\n}\n\n@media only screen and (min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 480px) and (resolution: 150dpi) {\n  body {\n    line-height: 1.4;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [Media Queries Level 4](https://drafts.csswg.org/mediaqueries/#media-descriptor-table) |\n| [CSS Conditional Rules Module Level 3](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-conditional-3/#at-media) |\n\n## Browser compatibility\n\n\n## See also\n- [CSS media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries) module\n- [Using media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries)\n- [CSSMediaRule](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSSMediaRule) interface\n- [Extended Mozilla media features](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Mozilla_Extensions#media_features)\n- [Extended WebKit media features](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/WebKit_Extensions#media_features)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media", "title": "@media", "description": "The @media CSS at-rule can be used to apply part of a style sheet based on the result of one or more media queries.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"KeyboardEvent.key\"?\n\nAssistant: The KeyboardEvent interface's key read-only property returns the value of the key pressed by the user, taking into consideration the state of modifier keys such as Shift as well as the keyboard locale and layout.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Value\nA string.\n\nIts value is determined as follows:\n\n- If the pressed key has a printed representation, the returned value is a non-empty Unicode character string containing the printable representation of the key. For example: if the pressed key is the Space key, the returned value is a single space ( \" \"). If the pressed key is the B key, the returned value is the string \"b\". However, if the Shift key is pressed at the same time (so shiftKey is true), the returned value is the string \"B\".\n- If the pressed key is a control or special character, the returned value is one of the pre-defined key values.\n- If the KeyboardEvent represents the press of a dead key, the key value must be \"Dead\".\n- Some specialty keyboard keys (such as the extended keys for controlling media on multimedia keyboards) don't generate key codes on Windows; instead, they trigger WM_APPCOMMAND events. These events get mapped to DOM keyboard events, and are listed among the \"Virtual key codes\" for Windows, even though they aren't actually key codes.\n- If the key cannot be identified, the returned value is Unidentified.\n\n[See a full list of key values].\n\n## KeyboardEvent sequence\nEvery KeyboardEvent is fired in a pre-determined sequence. For a given key press, the sequence of KeyboardEvent s fired is as follows assuming that Event.preventDefault is not called:\n\n1. A keydown event is first fired. If the key is held down further and the key produces a character key, then the event continues to be emitted in a platform implementation dependent interval and the KeyboardEvent.repeat read only property is set to true.\n2. If the key produces a character key that would result in a character being inserted into possibly an <input>, <textarea> or an element with HTMLElement.contentEditable set to true, the beforeinput and input event types are fired in that order. Note that some other implementations may fire keypress event if supported. The events will be fired repeatedly while the key is held down.\n3. A keyup event is fired once the key is released. This completes the process.\n\nIn sequence 1 & 3, the KeyboardEvent.key attribute is defined and is set appropriately to a value according to the rules defined earlier.\n\n## KeyboardEvent sequence example\nConsider the event sequence generated when we interact with the Shift and the 2 key using a U.S keyboard layout as compared to when we do so using a UK keyboard layout.\n\nTry experimenting using the following two test cases:\n\n1. Press and hold the Shift key, then press 2 and release it. Next, release the Shift key.\n2. Press and hold the Shift key, then press and hold 2. Release the Shift key. Finally, release 2.\n\n## HTML\n```html\n<div class=\"fx\">\n  <div>\n    <textarea rows=\"5\" name=\"test-target\" id=\"test-target\"></textarea>\n    <button type=\"button\" name=\"btn-reset\" id=\"btn-reset\">Reset</button>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"flex\">\n    <pre id=\"console-log\"></pre>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n## CSS\n```css\n.fx {\n  -webkit-display: flex;\n  display: flex;\n  margin-left: -20px;\n  margin-right: -20px;\n}\n\n.fx > div {\n  padding-left: 20px;\n  padding-right: 20px;\n}\n\n.fx > div:first-child {\n  width: 30%;\n}\n\n.flex {\n  -webkit-flex: 1;\n  flex: 1;\n}\n\n#test-target {\n  display: block;\n  width: 100%;\n  margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n```\n\n## JavaScript\n```js\nconst textarea = document.getElementById(\"test-target\");\nconst consoleLog = document.getElementById(\"console-log\");\nconst btnReset = document.getElementById(\"btn-reset\");\n\nfunction logMessage(message) {\n  consoleLog.innerText += `${message}\\n`;\n}\n\ntextarea.addEventListener(\"keydown\", (e) => {\n  if (!e.repeat) {\n    logMessage(`Key \"${e.key}\" pressed [event: keydown]`);\n  } else {\n    logMessage(`Key \"${e.key}\" repeating [event: keydown]`);\n  }\n});\n\ntextarea.addEventListener(\"beforeinput\", (e) => {\n  logMessage(`Key \"${e.data}\" about to be input [event: beforeinput]`);\n});\n\ntextarea.addEventListener(\"input\", (e) => {\n  logMessage(`Key \"${e.data}\" input [event: input]`);\n});\n\ntextarea.addEventListener(\"keyup\", (e) => {\n  logMessage(`Key \"${e.key}\" released [event: keyup]`);\n});\n\nbtnReset.addEventListener(\"click\", (e) => {\n  let child = consoleLog.firstChild;\n  while (child) {\n    consoleLog.removeChild(child);\n    child = consoleLog.firstChild;\n  }\n  textarea.value = \"\";\n});\n```\n\n## Result\n**Note:**\nOn browsers that don't fully implement the InputEvent interface which is used for the beforeinput and input events, you may get incorrect output on those lines of the log output.\n\n## Case 1\nWhen the shift key is pressed, a keydown event is first fired, and the key property value is set to the string Shift. As we keep holding this key, the keydown event does not continue to fire repeatedly because it does not produce a character key.\n\nWhen key 2 is pressed, another keydown event is fired for this new key press, and the key property value for the event is set to the string @ for the U.S keyboard type and \" for the UK keyboard type, because of the active modifier shift key. The beforeinput and input events are fired next because a character key has been produced.\n\nAs we release the key 2, a keyup event is fired and the key property will maintain the string values @ and \" for the different keyboard layouts respectively.\n\nAs we finally release the shift key, another keyup event is fired for it, and the key attribute value remains Shift.\n\n## Case 2\nWhen the shift key is pressed, a keydown event is first fired, and the key property value is set to be the string Shift. As we keep holding this key, the keydown event does not continue to fire repeatedly because it produced no character key.\n\nWhen key 2 is pressed, another keydown event is fired for this new key press, and the key property value for the event is set to be the string @ for the U.S keyboard type and \" for the UK keyboard type, because of the active modifier shift key. The beforeinput and input events are fired next because a character key has been produced. As we keep holding the key, the keydown event continues to fire repeatedly and the KeyboardEvent.repeat property is set to true. The beforeinput and input events are fired repeatedly as well.\n\nAs we release the shift key, a keyup event is fired for it, and the key attribute value remains Shift. At this point, notice that the key property value for the repeating keydown event of the key 2 key press is now \"2\" because the modifier shift key is no longer active. The same goes for the InputEvent.data property of the beforeinput and input events.\n\nAs we finally release the key 2, a keyup event is fired but the key property will be set to the string value 2 for both keyboard layouts because the modifier shift key is no longer active.\n\n## Examples\nThis example uses EventTarget.addEventListener() to listen for keydown events. When they occur, the key's value is checked to see if it's one of the keys the code is interested in, and if it is, it gets processed in some way (possibly by steering a spacecraft, perhaps by changing the selected cell in a spreadsheet).\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key", "title": "KeyboardEvent.key", "description": "The KeyboardEvent interface's key read-only property returns the value of the key pressed by the user, taking into consideration the state of modifier keys such as Shift as well as the keyboard locale and layout.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": false, "section_count": 10, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 02:04:11", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:locale": "en_US", "ogLocale": "en_US", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key", "title": "KeyboardEvent: key property - Web APIs | MDN", "language": "en-US", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "og:image:width": "1920", "ogTitle": "KeyboardEvent: key property - Web APIs | MDN", "og:image:height": "1080", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:title": "KeyboardEvent: key property - Web APIs | MDN", "og:type": "website", "ogDescription": "The KeyboardEvent interface's key read-only property returns the value of the key pressed by the user, taking into consideration the state of modifier keys such as Shift as well as the keyboard locale and layout.", "description": "Learn about the KeyboardEvent.key property, including its type, code examples, specifications, and browser compatibility.", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:image:type": "image/png", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "position": ["1", "2", "3", "4"], "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "og:description": "The KeyboardEvent interface's key read-only property returns the value of the key pressed by the user, taking into consideration the state of modifier keys such as Shift as well as the keyboard locale and layout.", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "scrapeId": "4f51bda6-7be5-4a61-bc5d-e726a555b613", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"<picture>\"?\n\nAssistant: The <picture> HTML element contains zero or more <source> elements and one <img> element to offer alternative versions of an image for different display/device scenarios.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Introduction\nThe <picture> HTML element contains zero or more <source> elements and one <img> element to offer alternative versions of an image for different display/device scenarios.\n\nThe browser will consider each child <source> element and choose the best match among them. If no matches are found—or the browser doesn't support the <picture> element—the URL of the <img> element's src attribute is selected. The selected image is then presented in the space occupied by the <img> element.\n\n## Try it\n```html\n<!--Change the browser window width to see the image change.-->\n<picture>\n  <source\n    srcset=\"/shared-assets/images/examples/surfer.jpg\"\n    media=\"(orientation: portrait)\" />\n  <img src=\"/shared-assets/images/examples/painted-hand.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n</picture>\n```\n\n## User Agent Behavior\nTo decide which URL to load, the user agent examines each <source>'s srcset, media, and type attributes to select a compatible image that best matches the current layout and capabilities of the display device.\n\n## Purpose of <img> Element\nThe <img> element serves two purposes:\n1. It describes the size and other attributes of the image and its presentation.\n2. It provides a fallback in case none of the offered <source> elements are able to provide a usable image.\n\n## Common Use Cases for <picture>\n- **Art direction.** Cropping or modifying images for different media conditions (for example, loading a simpler version of an image which has too many details, on smaller displays).\n- **Offering alternative image formats**, for cases where certain formats are not supported.\n- **Saving bandwidth and speeding page load times** by loading the most appropriate image for the viewer's display.\n\n## Higher-Density Images\nIf providing higher-density versions of an image for high-DPI (Retina) display, use srcset on the <img> element instead. This lets browsers opt for lower-density versions in data-saving modes, and you don't have to write explicit media conditions.\n\n## Attributes\nThis element includes only global attributes.\n\n## Usage Notes\nYou can use the object-position property to adjust the positioning of the image within the element's frame, and the object-fit property to control how the image is resized to fit within the frame.\n\n**Note:** Use these properties on the child <img> element, **not** the <picture> element.\n\n## Examples\nThese examples demonstrate how different attributes of the <source> element change the selection of the image inside <picture>.\n\n## The media attribute\nThe media attribute specifies a media condition (similar to a media query) that the user agent will evaluate for each <source> element.\n\nIf the <source>'s media condition evaluates to false, the browser skips it and evaluates the next element inside <picture>.\n\n```html\n<picture>\n  <source srcset=\"mdn-logo-wide.png\" media=\"(min-width: 600px)\" />\n  <img src=\"mdn-logo-narrow.png\" alt=\"MDN\" />\n</picture>\n```\n\n## The srcset attribute\nThe srcset attribute is used to offer a list of possible images based on size or the display's pixel density.\n\nIt is composed of a comma-separated list of image descriptors. Each image descriptor is composed of a URL of the image, and either:\n- a width descriptor, followed by a w (such as 300w);\n- or a pixel density descriptor, followed by an x (such as 2x) to serve a high-res image for high-DPI screens.\n\nMake sure to note that:\n- width and pixel density descriptors should not be used together\n- a missing pixel density descriptor implies 1x\n- duplicate descriptor values are not allowed (2x & 2x, 100w & 100w)\n\nThe following example illustrates the usage of srcset attribute with the <source> element to specify a high-density and standard-resolution image:\n\n```html\n<picture>\n  <source srcset=\"logo.png, logo-1.5x.png 1.5x\" />\n  <img src=\"logo.png\" alt=\"MDN Web Docs logo\" height=\"320\" width=\"320\" />\n</picture>\n```\n\nThe srcset attribute can also be used on the <img> element without needing the <picture> element. The following example demonstrates how to use the srcset attribute to specify standard-resolution and high-density images, respectively:\n\n```html\n<img\n  srcset=\"logo.png, logo-2x.png 2x\"\n  src=\"logo.png\"\n  height=\"320\"\n  width=\"320\"\n  alt=\"MDN Web Docs logo\" />\n```\n\n## The sizes attribute\nThe sizes attribute is not mandatory when using srcset, but it is recommended to use it in order to provide additional information to the browser to help it select the best image source.\n\nWithout sizes, the browser will use the default size of the image as specified by its dimensions in pixels. This may not be the best fit for all devices, especially if the image is displayed on different screen sizes or in different contexts.\n\n## The type attribute\nThe type attribute specifies a MIME type for the resource URL(s) in the <source> element's srcset attribute.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"ARIA Roles\"?\n\nAssistant: ARIA roles provide semantic meaning to content, allowing screen readers and other tools to present and support interaction with an object in a way that is consistent with user expectations of that type of object. ARIA roles can be used to describe elements that don't natively exist in HTML or exist but don't yet have full browser support.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## ARIA role types\nThere are 6 categories of ARIA roles:\n\n1. Document structure roles\n2. Widget roles\n3. Landmark roles\n4. Live region roles\n5. Window roles\n6. Abstract roles\n\n## 1. Document structure roles\nDocument Structure roles are used to provide a structural description for a section of content. Most of these roles should no longer be used as browsers now support semantic HTML elements with the same meaning. The roles without HTML equivalents, such as presentation, toolbar and tooltip roles, provide information on the document structure to assistive technologies such as screen readers as equivalent native HTML tags are not available.\n\n- toolbar\n- tooltip\n- feed\n- math\n- presentation / none\n- note\n\nFor most document structure roles, semantic HTML equivalent elements are available and supported. Avoid using:\n\n- application\n- article (use <article>)\n- cell (use <td>)\n- columnheader (use <th scope=\"col\">)\n- definition (use <dfn>)\n- directory\n- document\n- figure (use <figure>)\n- group\n- heading (use h1 through h6)\n- img (use <img> or <picture>)\n- list (use <ul> or <ol>)\n- listitem (use <li>)\n- meter (use <meter>)\n- row (use <tr> with <table>)\n- rowgroup (use <thead>, <tfoot> and <tbody>)\n- rowheader (use <th scope=\"row\">)\n- separator (use <hr> if it doesn't have focus)\n- table (use <table>)\n- term (use <dfn>)\n\nThese are included for completeness, but in most cases are rarely, if ever, useful:\n\n- associationlist\n- associationlistitemkey\n- associationlistitemvalue\n- blockquote\n- caption\n- code\n- deletion\n- emphasis\n- insertion\n- paragraph\n- strong\n- subscript\n- superscript\n- time\n\n## 2. Widget roles\nWidget roles are used to define common interactive patterns. Like document structure roles, some widget roles have the same semantics as well-supported native HTML elements, and therefore should be avoided. The key difference is that widget roles typically require JavaScript for interaction, while document structure roles often do not.\n\n- scrollbar\n- searchbox\n- separator (when focusable)\n- slider\n- spinbutton\n- switch\n- tab\n- tabpanel\n- treeitem\n\nAvoid using button, checkbox, gridcell, link, menuitem, menuitemcheckbox, menuitemradio, option, progressbar, radio, and textbox, which we've included for completeness. For most, semantic equivalents with accessible interactivity are available and supported. See the individual role documentation for more information.\n\n## 3. Landmark roles\nLandmark roles provide a way to identify the organization and structure of a web page. By classifying and labeling sections of a page, structural information conveyed visually through layout is represented programmatically. Screen readers use landmark roles to provide keyboard navigation to important sections of a page. Use these sparingly. Too many landmark roles create \"noise\" in screen readers, making it difficult to understand the overall layout of the page.\n\n- banner (document <header>)\n- complementary (<aside>)\n- contentinfo (document <footer>)\n- form (<form>)\n- main (<main>)\n- navigation (<nav>)\n- region (<section>)\n- search (<search>)\n\n## 4. Live region roles\nLive Region roles are used to define elements with content that will be dynamically changed. Sighted users can see dynamic changes when they are visually noticeable. These roles help low vision and blind users know if content has been updated. Assistive technologies, like screen readers, can be made to announce dynamic content changes:\n\n- alert\n- log\n- marquee\n- status\n- timer\n\n## 5. Window roles\nWindow roles define sub-windows to the main document window, within the same window, such as pop up modal dialogs:\n\n- alertdialog\n- dialog\n\n## 6. Abstract roles\nAbstract roles are only intended for use by browsers to help organize and streamline a document. They should not be used by developers writing HTML markup. Doing so will not result in any meaningful information being conveyed to assistive technologies or to users.\n\nAvoid using command, composite, input, landmark, range, roletype, section, sectionhead, select, structure, widget, and window.\n\n## Roles defined on MDN\nThe following are the reference pages covering the WAI-ARIA roles discussed on MDN.\n\n- ARIA: alert role\n- ARIA: alertdialog role\n- ARIA: application role\n- ARIA: article role\n- ARIA: banner role\n- ARIA: button role\n- ARIA: cell role\n- ARIA: checkbox role\n- ARIA: columnheader role\n- ARIA: combobox role\n- ARIA: command role\n- ARIA: comment role\n- ARIA: complementary role\n- ARIA: composite role\n- ARIA: contentinfo role\n- ARIA: definition role\n- ARIA: dialog role\n- ARIA: directory role\n- ARIA: document role\n- ARIA: document structural roles\n- ARIA: feed role\n- ARIA: figure role\n- ARIA: form role\n- ARIA: generic role\n- ARIA: grid role\n- ARIA: gridcell role\n- ARIA: group role\n- ARIA: heading role\n- ARIA: img role\n- ARIA: input role\n- ARIA: landmark role\n- ARIA: link role\n- ARIA: list role\n- ARIA: listbox role\n- ARIA: listitem role\n- ARIA: log role\n- ARIA: main role\n- ARIA: mark role\n- ARIA: marquee role\n- ARIA: math role\n- ARIA: menu role\n- ARIA: menubar role\n- ARIA: menuitem role\n- ARIA: menuitemcheckbox role\n- ARIA: menuitemradio role\n- ARIA: meter role\n- ARIA: navigation role\n- ARIA: none role\n- ARIA: note role\n- ARIA: option role\n- ARIA: presentation role\n- ARIA: progressbar role\n- ARIA: radio role\n- ARIA: radiogroup role\n- ARIA: range role\n- ARIA: region role\n- ARIA: roletype role\n- ARIA: row role\n- ARIA: rowgroup role\n- ARIA: rowheader role\n- ARIA: scrollbar role\n- ARIA: search role\n- ARIA: searchbox role\n- ARIA: section role\n- ARIA: sectionhead role\n- ARIA: select role\n- ARIA: separator role\n- ARIA: slider role\n- ARIA: spinbutton role\n- ARIA: status role\n- ARIA: structure role\n- ARIA: suggestion role\n- ARIA: switch role\n- ARIA: tab role\n- ARIA: table role\n- ARIA: tablist role\n- ARIA: tabpanel role\n- ARIA: term role\n- ARIA: textbox role\n- ARIA: timer role\n- ARIA: toolbar role\n- ARIA: tooltip role\n- ARIA: tree role\n- ARIA: treegrid role\n- ARIA: treeitem role\n- ARIA: widget role\n- ARIA: window role.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles", "title": "ARIA Roles", "description": "ARIA roles provide semantic meaning to content, allowing screen readers and other tools to present and support interaction with an object in a way that is consistent with user expectations of that type of object.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"HTML Dialog Element\"?\n\nAssistant: The <dialog> HTML element represents a modal or non-modal dialog box or other interactive component, such as a dismissible alert, inspector, or subwindow.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Attributes\nThis element includes the global attributes.\n\n**Warning:**\nThe `tabindex` attribute must not be used on the `<dialog>` element. See usage notes.\n\n`open`\n\nIndicates that the dialog box is active and is available for interaction. If the `open` attribute is not set, the dialog box will not be visible to the user.\nIt is recommended to use the `.show()` or `.showModal()` method to render dialogs, rather than the `open` attribute. If a `<dialog>` is opened using the `open` attribute, it is non-modal.\n\n**Note:**\nWhile you can toggle between the open and closed states of non-modal dialog boxes by toggling the presence of the `open` attribute, this approach is not recommended.\n\n## Usage notes\n- HTML `<form>` elements can be used to close a dialog box if they have the attribute `method=\"dialog\"` or if the button used to submit the form has `formmethod=\"dialog\"` set. When a `<form>` within a `<dialog>` is submitted via the `dialog` method, the dialog box closes, the states of the form controls are saved but not submitted, and the `returnValue` property gets set to the value of the button that was activated.\n- The CSS `::backdrop` pseudo-element can be used to style the backdrop of a modal dialog, which is displayed behind the `<dialog>` element when the dialog is displayed using the `HTMLDialogElement.showModal()` method. For example, this pseudo-element could be used to blur, darken, or otherwise obfuscate the inert content behind the modal dialog.\n- The `autofocus` attribute should be added to the element the user is expected to interact with immediately upon opening a modal dialog. If no other element involves more immediate interaction, it is recommended to add `autofocus` to the close button inside the dialog, or the dialog itself if the user is expected to click/activate it to dismiss.\n- Do not add the `tabindex` property to the `<dialog>` element as it is not interactive and does not receive focus. The dialog's contents, including the close button contained in the dialog, can receive focus and be interactive.\n\n## Accessibility\nWhen implementing a dialog, it is important to consider the most appropriate place to set user focus. When using `HTMLDialogElement.showModal()` to open a `<dialog>`, focus is set on the first nested focusable element. Explicitly indicating the initial focus placement by using the `autofocus` attribute will help ensure initial focus is set on the element deemed the best initial focus placement for any particular dialog. When in doubt, as it may not always be known where initial focus could be set within a dialog, particularly for instances where a dialog's content is dynamically rendered when invoked, the `<dialog>` element itself may provide the best initial focus placement.\n\nEnsure a mechanism is provided to allow users to close the dialog. The most robust way to ensure that all users can close the dialog is to include an explicit button to do so, such as a confirmation, cancellation, or close button.\n\nBy default, a dialog invoked by the `showModal()` method can be dismissed by pressing the `Esc` key. A non-modal dialog does not dismiss via the `Esc` key by default, and depending on what the non-modal dialog represents, it may not be desired for this behavior. Keyboard users expect the `Esc` key to close modal dialogs; ensure that this behavior is implemented and maintained. If multiple modal dialogs are open, pressing the `Esc` key should close only the last shown dialog. When using `<dialog>`, this behavior is provided by the browser.\n\nWhile dialogs can be created using other elements, the native `<dialog>` element provides usability and accessibility features that must be replicated if you use other elements for a similar purpose. If you're creating a custom dialog implementation, ensure that all expected default behaviors are supported and proper labeling recommendations are followed.\n\n## Examples\n### HTML-only dialog\nThis example demonstrates the creation of a non-modal dialog by using only HTML. Because of the boolean `open` attribute in the `<dialog>` element, the dialog appears open when the page loads. The dialog can be closed by clicking the \"OK\" button because the `method` attribute in the `<form>` element is set to \"dialog\". In this case, no JavaScript is needed to close the form.\n\n```html\n<dialog open>\n  <p>Greetings, one and all!</p>\n  <form method=\"dialog\">\n    <button>OK</button>\n  </form>\n</dialog>\n```\n\n### Creating a modal dialog\nThis example demonstrates a modal dialog with a gradient backdrop. The `.showModal()` method opens the modal dialog when the \"Show the dialog\" button is activated. The dialog can be closed by pressing the `Esc` key or via the `close()` method when the \"Close\" button within the dialog is activated.\n\n```html\n<dialog>\n  <button autofocus>Close</button>\n  <p>This modal dialog has a groovy backdrop!</p>\n</dialog>\n<button>Show the dialog</button>\n```\n\n### Handling the return value from the dialog\nThis example demonstrates the `returnValue` of the `<dialog>` element and how to close a modal dialog by using a form. By default, the `returnValue` is the empty string or the value of the button that submits the form within the `<dialog>` element, if there is one.\n\n```html\n<dialog id=\"favDialog\">\n  <form>\n    <p>\n      <label>\n        Favorite animal:\n        <select>\n          <option value=\"default\">Choose…</option>\n          <option>Brine shrimp</option>\n          <option>Red panda</option>\n          <option>Spider monkey</option>\n        </select>\n      </label>\n    </p>\n    <div>\n      <button value=\"cancel\" formmethod=\"dialog\">Cancel</button>\n      <button id=\"confirmBtn\" value=\"default\">Confirm</button>\n    </div>\n  </form>\n</dialog>\n<p>\n  <button id=\"showDialog\">Show the dialog</button>\n</p>\n<output></output>\n```\n\n## Technical summary\n| Content categories | Flow content,<br> sectioning root |\n| Permitted content | Flow content |\n| Tag omission | None, both the starting and ending tag are mandatory. |\n| Permitted parents | Any element that accepts<br> flow content |\n| Implicit ARIA role | dialog |\n| Permitted ARIA roles | alertdialog |\n| DOM interface | HTMLDialogElement |\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| HTML# the-dialog-element |\n\n## Browser compatibility\n|  | desktop | mobile |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Chrome | Edge | Firefox | Opera | Safari | Chrome Android | Firefox for Android | Opera Android | Safari on iOS | Samsung Internet | WebView Android | WebView on iOS |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `dialog` | Chrome – Full support<br>Chrome37<br>Toggle history | Edge – Full support<br>Edge79<br>Toggle history | Firefox – Full support<br>Firefox98<br>Toggle history | Opera – Full support<br>Opera24<br>Toggle history | Safari – Full support<br>Safari15.4<br>Toggle history | Chrome Android – Full support<br>Chrome Android37<br>Toggle history | Firefox for Android – Full support<br>Firefox for Android98<br>Toggle history | Opera Android – Full support<br>Opera Android24<br>Toggle history | Safari on iOS – Full support<br>Safari on iOS15.4<br>Toggle history | Samsung Internet – Full support<br>Samsung Internet3.0<br>Toggle history | WebView Android – Full support<br>WebView Android37<br>Toggle history | WebView on iOS – Full support<br>WebView on iOS15.4<br>Toggle history |\n\n## See also\n- HTMLDialogElement interface\n- close event of the HTMLDialogElement interface\n- cancel event of the HTMLDialogElement interface\n- open property of the HTMLDialogElement interface\n- inert global attribute for HTML elements\n- ::backdrop CSS pseudo-element\n- Web forms in the Learn area\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog", "title": "HTML Dialog Element", "description": "The <dialog> HTML element represents a modal or non-modal dialog box or other interactive component, such as a dismissible alert, inspector, or subwindow.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 8, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 02:09:55", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "ogTitle": "<dialog>: The Dialog element -

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Using FormData Objects\"?\n\nAssistant: This page covers how to use the FormData object to compile a set of key/value pairs to send using the Fetch or XMLHttpRequest API, primarily for sending form data.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Creating a `FormData` object from scratch\nYou can build a `FormData` object yourself, instantiating it then appending fields to it by calling its `append()` method, like this:\n\n```javascript\nconst send = document.querySelector(\"#send\");\n\nsend.addEventListener(\"click\", async () => {\n  const formData = new FormData();\n  formData.append(\"username\", \"Groucho\");\n  formData.append(\"accountNum\", 123456);\n\n  // A file <input> element\n  const avatar = document.querySelector(\"#avatar\");\n  formData.append(\"avatar\", avatar.files[0]);\n\n  // JavaScript file-like object\n  const content = '<q id=\"a\"><span id=\"b\">hey!</span></q>';\n  const blob = new Blob([content], { type: \"text/xml\" });\n  formData.append(\"webmasterFile\", blob);\n\n  const response = await fetch(\"http://example.org/post\", {\n    method: \"POST\",\n    body: formData,\n  });\n  console.log(await response.json());\n});\n```\n\n**Note:** The fields \"avatar\" and \"webmasterFile\" both contain a file. The number assigned to the field \"accountNum\" is immediately converted into a string by the `FormData.append()` method (the field's value can be a `Blob`, `File`, or a string. If the value is neither a `Blob` nor a `File`, the value is converted to a string). This example builds a `FormData` instance containing values for fields named \"username\", \"accountNum\", \"avatar\" and \"webmasterFile\", then uses `fetch()` to send the form's data. The field \"webmasterFile\" is a `Blob`. A `Blob` object represents a file-like object of immutable, raw data. Blobs represent data that isn't necessarily in a JavaScript-native format. The `File` interface is based on `Blob`, inheriting blob functionality and expanding it to support files on the user's system. In order to build a `Blob` you can invoke the `Blob()` constructor.\n\n## Retrieving a `FormData` object from an HTML form\nTo construct a `FormData` object that contains the data from an existing `<form>`, specify that form element when creating the `FormData` object:\n\n**Note:** `FormData` will only use input fields that use the `name` attribute.\n\n```javascript\nconst formData = new FormData(someFormElement);\n```\n\nFor example:\n\n```javascript\nconst send = document.querySelector(\"#send\");\n\nsend.addEventListener(\"click\", async () => {\n  // A <form> element\n  const userInfo = document.querySelector(\"#user-info\");\n  const formData = new FormData(userInfo);\n\n  const response = await fetch(\"http://example.org/post\", {\n    method: \"POST\",\n    body: formData,\n  });\n  console.log(await response.json());\n});\n```\n\nYou can also append additional data to the `FormData` object between retrieving it from a form and sending it, like this:\n\n```javascript\nconst send = document.querySelector(\"#send\");\n\nsend.addEventListener(\"click\", async () => {\n  const userInfo = document.querySelector(\"#user-info\");\n  const formData = new FormData(userInfo);\n  formData.append(\"serialnumber\", 12345);\n\n  const response = await fetch(\"http://example.org/post\", {\n    method: \"POST\",\n    body: formData,\n  });\n  console.log(await response.json());\n});\n```\n\nThis lets you augment the form's data before sending it along, to include additional information that's not necessarily user-editable.\n\n## Sending files using a `FormData` object\nYou can also send files using `FormData`. Include an `<input>` element of type `file` in your `<form>`:\n\n```html\n<form enctype=\"multipart/form-data\" method=\"post\" name=\"fileinfo\" id=\"fileinfo\">\n  <p>\n    <label>Your email address:\n      <input type=\"email\" autocomplete=\"on\" name=\"userid\" placeholder=\"email\" required size=\"32\" maxlength=\"64\" />\n    </label>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <label>Custom file label:\n      <input type=\"text\" name=\"file-label\" size=\"12\" maxlength=\"32\" />\n    </label>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <label>File to stash:\n      <input type=\"file\" name=\"file\" required />\n    </label>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Stash the file!\" />\n  </p>\n</form>\n```\n\nThen you can send it using code like the following:\n\n```javascript\nconst form = document.querySelector(\"#fileinfo\");\n\nform.addEventListener(\"submit\", async (event) => {\n  const formData = new FormData(form);\n\n  formData.append(\"CustomField\", \"This is some extra data\");\n\n  const response = await fetch(\"stash.php\", {\n    method: \"POST\",\n    body: formData,\n  });\n  event.preventDefault();\n});\n```\n\n**Note:** If you pass in a reference to the form, the request HTTP method specified in the form will be used over the method specified in the `open()` call.\n\n**Warning:** When using `FormData` to submit POST requests using `XMLHttpRequest` or the Fetch API with the `multipart/form-data` content type (e.g. when uploading files and blobs to the server), _do not_ explicitly set the `Content-Type` header on the request. Doing so will prevent the browser from being able to set the `Content-Type` header with the boundary expression it will use to delimit form fields in the request body.\n\nYou can also append a `File` or `Blob` directly to the `FormData` object, like this:\n\n```javascript\ndata.append(\"myfile\", myBlob, \"filename.txt\");\n```\n\nWhen using the `append()` method it is possible to use the third optional parameter to pass a filename inside the `Content-Disposition` header that is sent to the server. When no filename is specified (or the parameter isn't supported), the name \"blob\" is used.\n\n## Using a `formdata` event\nThe `formdata` event, more recent than the `FormData` object, is fired on an `HTMLFormElement` object after the entry list representing the form's data is constructed. This happens when the form is submitted, but can also be triggered by the invocation of a `FormData()` constructor.\n\nThis allows a `FormData` object to be quickly obtained in response to a `formdata` event firing, rather than needing to put it together yourself.\n\nFor example, in the JavaScript we can reference a form:\n\n```javascript\nconst formElem = document.querySelector(\"form\");\n```\n\nIn our `submit` event handler we use `preventDefault` to stop the default form submission, then invoke a `FormData()` constructor to trigger the `formdata` event:\n\n```javascript\nformElem.addEventListener(\"submit\", (e) => {\n  // on form submission, prevent default\n  e.preventDefault();\n\n  // construct a FormData object, which fires the formdata event\n  new FormData(formElem);\n});\n```\n\nWhen the `formdata` event fires we can access the `FormData` object using `FormDataEvent.formData`, then do what we like with it (below we post it to the server using `XMLHttpRequest`).\n\n```javascript\nformElem.addEventListener(\"formdata\", (e) => {\n  console.log(\"formdata fired\");\n\n  // Get the form data from the event object\n  const data = e.formData;\n  for (const value of data.values()) {\n    console.log(value);\n  }\n\n  // Submit the data via fetch()\n  fetch(\"/formHandler\", {\n    method: \"POST\",\n    body: data,\n  });\n});\n```\n\n## Gotchas\nThe `FormData` object doesn't include data from the fields that are disabled or the fieldsets that are disabled.\n\n## See also\n- [Using the Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)\n- [`HTMLFormElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement)\n- [`Blob`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob)\n- [Typed Arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Typed_arrays)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest_API/Using_FormData_Objects", "title": "Using FormData Objects", "description": "This page covers how to use the FormData object to compile a set of key/value pairs to send using the Fetch or XMLHttpRequest API, primarily for sending form data.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 6, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 02:11:51", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "og:locale": "en_US", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest_API/Using_FormData_Objects", "og:image:type": "image/png", "ogLocale": "en_US", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "title": "Using FormData Objects - Web APIs | MDN", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "ogDescription": "The FormData object lets you compile a set of key/value pairs to send using the Fetch or XMLHttpRequest API.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Math in JavaScript\"?\n\nAssistant: This article discusses how to use operators and other features in JavaScript to manipulate numbers effectively.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Prerequisites and Learning Outcomes\nPrerequisites: An understanding of HTML and the fundamentals of CSS.\nLearning outcomes: - Basic number operations in JavaScript — add, subtract, multiply, and divide.\n- numbers are not numbers if they are defined as strings, and can cause calculations to go wrong.\n- Converting strings to numbers with `Number()`.\n- Operator precedence.\n- Incrementing and decrementing.\n- Assignment and comparison operators.\n- Basic Math object methods, such as `Math.random()`, `Math.floor()`, and `Math.ceil()`.\n\n## Everybody loves math\nOkay, maybe not. Some of us like math, some of us have hated math ever since we had to learn multiplication tables and long division in school, and some of us sit somewhere in between the two. But none of us can deny that math is a fundamental part of life that we can't get very far without. This is especially true when we are learning to program JavaScript (or any other language for that matter) — so much of what we do relies on processing numerical data, calculating new values, and so on, that you won't be surprised to learn that JavaScript has a full-featured set of math functions available.\n\n## Types of numbers\nIn programming, even the humble decimal number system that we all know so well is more complicated than you might think. We use different terms to describe different types of decimal numbers, for example:\n- **Integers** are numbers without a fractional part. They can either be positive or negative, e.g. 10, 400, or -5.\n- **Floating point numbers** (floats) have decimal points and decimal places, for example 12.5, and 56.7786543.\nWe even have different types of number systems! Decimal is base 10 (meaning it uses 0–9 in each digit), but we also have things like:\n- **Binary** — The lowest level language of computers; 0s and 1s.\n- **Octal** — Base 8, uses 0–7 in each digit.\n- **Hexadecimal** — Base 16, uses 0–9 and then a–f in each digit. You may have encountered these numbers before when setting colors in CSS.\n**Note:** JavaScript has a second number type, [BigInt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/BigInt), used for very, very large integers.\n\n## It's all numbers to me\nLet's quickly play with some numbers to reacquaint ourselves with the basic syntax we need. Enter the commands listed below into your developer tools JavaScript console.\n1. First of all, let's declare a couple of variables and initialize them with an integer and a float, respectively, then type the variable names back in to check that everything is in order:\n```javascript\nconst myInt = 5;\nconst myFloat = 6.667;\nmyInt;\nmyFloat;\n```\n2. Number values are typed in without quote marks — try declaring and initializing a couple more variables containing numbers before you move on.\n3. Now let's check that both our original variables are of the same datatype. There is an operator called `typeof` in JavaScript that does this. Enter the below two lines as shown:\n```javascript\ntypeof myInt;\ntypeof myFloat;\n```\nYou should get \"number\" returned in both cases.\n\n## Useful Number methods\nThe `Number` object has a number of useful methods available on it for you to manipulate numbers. For example, to round your number to a fixed number of decimal places, use the `toFixed()` method. Type the following lines into your browser's console:\n```javascript\nconst lotsOfDecimal = 1.766584958675746364;\nlotsOfDecimal;\nconst twoDecimalPlaces = lotsOfDecimal.toFixed(2);\ntwoDecimalPlaces;\n```\n\n## Converting to number data types\nSometimes you might end up with a number that is stored as a string type, which makes it difficult to perform calculations with it. This most commonly happens when data is entered into a form input, and the input type is text. To solve this problem, pass the string value into the `Number()` constructor to return a number version of the same value. For example:\n```javascript\nlet myNumber = \"74\";\nmyNumber += 3;\n```\nYou end up with the result 743, not 77, because `myNumber` is actually defined as a string. To fix the calculation, you can do this:\n```javascript\nlet myNumber = \"74\";\nmyNumber = Number(myNumber) + 3;\n```\n\n## Arithmetic operators\nArithmetic operators are used for performing mathematical calculations in JavaScript:\n| Operator | Name | Purpose | Example |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `+` | Addition | Adds two numbers together. | `6 + 9` |\n| `-` | Subtraction | Subtracts the right number from the left. | `20 - 15` |\n| `*` | Multiplication | Multiplies two numbers together. | `3 * 7` |\n| `/` | Division | Divides the left number by the right. | `10 / 5` |\n| `%` | Remainder | Returns the remainder left over after you've divided the left number into a number of integer portions equal to the right number. | `8 % 3` |\n| `**` | Exponent | Raises a `base` number to the `exponent` power. | `5 ** 2` |\n\n## Operator precedence\nOperator precedence in JavaScript is the same as is taught in math classes in school — multiply and divide are always done first, then add and subtract. If you want to override operator precedence, you can put parentheses around the parts that you want to be explicitly dealt with first.\n\n## Increment and decrement operators\nSometimes you'll want to repeatedly add or subtract one to or from a numeric variable value. This can be conveniently done using the increment ( `++`) and decrement ( `--`) operators. For example:\n```javascript\nlet num1 = 4;\nnum1++;\n```\nYou can only increment an existing variable.\n\n## Assignment operators\nAssignment operators are operators that assign a value to a variable. The most common are listed below:\n| Operator | Name | Purpose | Example |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `+=` | Addition assignment | Adds the value on the right to the variable value on the left. | `x += 4;` |\n| `-=` | Subtraction assignment | Subtracts the value on the right from the variable value on the left. | `x -= 3;` |\n| `*=` | Multiplication assignment | Multiplies the variable value on the left by the value on the right. | `x *= 3;` |\n| `/=` | Division assignment | Divides the variable value on the left by the value on the right. | `x /= 5;` |\n\n## Active learning: sizing a canvas box\nIn this exercise, you will manipulate some numbers and operators to change the size of a box. The width and height of the box (in pixels) are defined by the variables `x` and `y`, which are initially both given a value of 50.\n\n## Comparison operators\nSometimes we will want to run true/false tests, then act accordingly depending on the result of that test — to do this we use comparison operators. For example:\n| Operator | Name | Purpose | Example |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `===` | Strict equality | Tests whether the left and right values are identical to one another | `5 === 2 + 4` |\n| `!==` | Strict-non-equality | Tests whether the left and right values are **not** identical to one another | `5 !== 2 + 3` |\n\n## Test your skills!\nYou've reached the end of this article, but can you remember the most important information? You can find some further tests to verify that you've retained this information before you move on.\n\n## Summary\nIn this article, we have covered the fundamental information you need to know about numbers in JavaScript. If you are one of those people that doesn't enjoy math, you can take comfort in the fact that this chapter was pretty short.\n\n## See also\n- [Numbers and strings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Numbers_and_strings)\n- [Expressions and operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_operators)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Math", "title": "Math in JavaScript", "description": "This article discusses how to use operators and other features in JavaScript to manipulate numbers effectively.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 15, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 02:12:20", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"position": ["1", "2", "3", "4"], "description": "At this point in the course, we discuss math in JavaScript — how we can use operators and other features to successfully manipulate numbers to do our bidding.", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Math", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "language": "en-US", "ogDescription": "At this point in the course, we discuss math in JavaScript — how we can use operators and other features to successfully manipulate numbers to do our bidding.", "og:title": "Basic math in JavaScript — numbers and operators - Learn web development | MDN", "og:type": "website", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Math", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "ogTitle": "Basic math in JavaScript — numbers and operators - Learn web development | MDN", "og:locale": "en_US", "og:description": "At this point in the course, we discuss math in JavaScript — how we can use operators and other features to successfully manipulate numbers to do our bidding.", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "og:image:width": "1920", "viewport": ["width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "width=device-width", "width=device-width"], "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:image:type": "image/png", "og:image:height": "1080", "ogLocale": "en_US", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "title": "Basic math in JavaScript — numbers and operators - Learn web development | MDN", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "scrapeId": "7a4c46e2-bce9-41f6-abfd-705b5fe92d34", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Math", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Math", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Box model\"?\n\nAssistant: Everything in CSS has a box around it, and understanding these boxes is key to being able to create more complex layouts with CSS, or to align items with other items. In this lesson, we will take a look at the CSS Box model. You'll get an understanding of how it works and the terminology that relates to it.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Block and inline boxes\nIn CSS we have several types of boxes that generally fit into the categories of **block boxes** and **inline boxes**. The type refers to how the box behaves in terms of page flow and in relation to other boxes on the page. Boxes have an **inner display type** and an **outer display type**.\n\nIn general, you can set various values for the display type using the [`display`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display) property, which can have various values.\n\nIf a box has a display value of `block`, then:\n\n- The box will break onto a new line.\n- The [`width`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/width) and [`height`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/height) properties are respected.\n- Padding, margin and border will cause other elements to be pushed away from the box.\n- If [`width`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/width) is not specified, the box will extend in the inline direction to fill the space available in its container. In most cases, the box will become as wide as its container, filling up 100% of the space available.\n\nSome HTML elements, such as `<h1>` and `<p>`, use `block` as their outer display type by default.\n\nIf a box has a display type of `inline`, then:\n\n- The box will not break onto a new line.\n- The [`width`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/width) and [`height`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/height) properties will not apply.\n- Top and bottom padding, margins, and borders will apply but will not cause other inline boxes to move away from the box.\n- Left and right padding, margins, and borders will apply and will cause other inline boxes to move away from the box.\n\nSome HTML elements, such as `<a>`, `<span>`, `<em>` and `<strong>` use `inline` as their outer display type by default.\n\nBlock and inline layout is the default way things behave on the web. By default and without any other instruction, the elements inside a box are also laid out in **[normal flow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/CSS_layout/Introduction#normal_layout_flow)** and behave as block or inline boxes.\n\n## Inner and outer display types\n`block` and `inline` display values are said to be **outer display** types — they affect how the box is laid out in relation to other boxes around it. Boxes also have an **inner display** type, which dictates how elements inside that box are laid out.\n\nYou can change the inner display type by setting an inner display value, for example `display: flex;`. The element will still use the outer display type `block` but this changes the inner display type to `flex`. Any direct children of this box will become flex items and behave according to the [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/CSS_layout/Flexbox) specification.\n\nWhen you move on to learn about CSS Layout in more detail, you will encounter [`flex`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/CSS_layout/Flexbox), and various other inner values that your boxes can have, for example [`grid`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/CSS_layout/Grids).\n\nDon't worry too much about the inner and outer terminology for now; this is what is happening internally, and we mentioned it here in case you come across it elsewhere. Generally, you will just deal with single `display` values, and won't need to think about it much.\n\n## Examples of different display types\nThe example below has three different HTML elements, all of which have an outer display type of `block`.\n\n- A paragraph with a border added in CSS. The browser renders this as a block box. The paragraph starts on a new line and extends the entire available width.\n- A list, which is laid out using `display: flex`. This establishes flex layout for the children of the container, which are flex items. The list itself is a block box and — like the paragraph — expands to the full container width and breaks onto a new line.\n- A block-level paragraph, inside which are two `<span>` elements. These elements would normally be `inline`, however, one of the elements has a class of \"block\" which gets set to `display: block`.\n\n```html\n<p>I am a paragraph. A short one.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Item One</li>\n  <li>Item Two</li>\n  <li>Item Three</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  I am another paragraph. Some of the <span class=\"block\">words</span> have been\n  wrapped in a <span>span element</span>.\n</p>\n```\n\n```css\nbody {\n  font-family: sans-serif;\n}\np,\nul {\n  border: 2px solid rebeccapurple;\n  padding: 0.2em;\n}\n\n.block,\nli {\n  border: 2px solid blue;\n  padding: 0.2em;\n}\n\nul {\n  display: flex;\n  list-style: none;\n}\n\n.block {\n  display: block;\n}\n```\n\n## What is the CSS box model?\nThe CSS box model as a whole applies to block boxes and defines how the different parts of a box — margin, border, padding, and content — work together to create a box that you can see on a page. Inline boxes use just _some_ of the behavior defined in the box model.\n\nTo add complexity, there is a standard and an alternate box model. By default, browsers use the standard box model.\n\n## Parts of a box\nMaking up a block box in CSS we have the:\n\n- **Content box**: The area where your content is displayed; size it using properties like [`width`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/width) and [`height`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/height).\n- **Padding box**: The padding sits around the content as white space; size it using [`padding`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding) and related properties.\n- **Border box**: The border box wraps the content and any padding; size it using [`border`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border) and related properties.\n- **Margin box**: The margin is the outermost layer, wrapping the content, padding, and border as whitespace between this box and other elements; size it using [`margin`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin) and related properties.\n\n## The standard CSS box model\nIn the standard box model, if you set `width` and `height` property values on a box, these values define the `width` and `height` of the _content box_. Any padding and borders are then added to those dimensions to get the total size taken up by the box (see the image below).\n\nIf we assume that a box has the following CSS:\n\n```css\n.box {\n  width: 350px;\n  height: 150px;\n  margin: 10px;\n  padding: 25px;\n  border: 5px solid black;\n}\n```\n\nThe _actual_ space taken up by the box will be 410px wide (350 + 25 + 25 + 5 + 5) and 210px high (150 + 25 + 25 + 5 + 5).\n\n**Note:**\nThe margin is not counted towards the actual size of the box — sure, it affects the total space that the box will take up on the page, but only the space outside the box. The box's area stops at the border — it does not extend into the margin.\n\n## The alternative CSS box model\nIn the alternative box model, any width is the width of the visible box on the page. The content area width is that width minus the width for the padding and border (see image below). No need to add up the border and padding to get the real size of the box.\n\nTo turn on the alternative model for an element, set `box-sizing: border-box` on it:\n\n```css\n.box {\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n}\n```\n\nIf we assume the box has the same CSS as above:\n\n```css\n.box {\n  width: 350px;\n  height: 150px;\n  margin: 10px;\n  padding: 25px;\n  border: 5px solid black;\n}\n```\n\nNow, the _actual_ space taken up by the box will be 350px in the inline direction and 150px in the block direction.\n\n## Playing with box models\nIn the example below, you can see two boxes. Both have a class of `.box`, which gives them the same `width`, `height`, `margin`, `border`, and `padding`. The only difference is that the second box has been set to use the alternative box model.\nCan you change the size of the second box (by adding CSS to the `.alternate` class) to make it match the first box in width and height?\n\n```html\n<div class=\"box\">I use the standard box model.</div>\n<div class=\"box alternate\">I use the alternate box model.</div>\n```\n\n```css\n.box {\n  border: 5px solid rebeccapurple;\n  background-color: lightgray;\n  padding: 40px;\n  margin: 40px;\n  width: 300px;\n  height: 150px;\n}\n\n.alternate {\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n}\n```\n\n## Use browser DevTools to view the box model\nYour [browser developer tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools) can make understanding the box model far easier — they can show you the size of the element plus its margin, padding, and border. Inspecting an element in this way is a great way to find out if your box is really the size you think it is!\n\n## Margins, padding, and borders\nYou've already seen the [`margin`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin), [`padding`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding), and [`border`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border) properties at work in the example above. The properties used in that example are **shorthands** and allow us to set all four sides of the box at once. These shorthands also have equivalent longhand properties, which allow control over the different sides of the box individually.\n\n## Margin\nThe margin is an invisible space around your box. It pushes other elements away from the box. Margins can have positive or negative values. Setting a negative margin on one side of your box can cause it to overlap other things on the page. Whether you are using the standard or alternative box model, the margin is always added after the size of the visible box has been calculated.\n\n## Borders\nThe border is drawn between the margin and the padding of a box. If you are using the standard box model, the size of the border is added to the `width` and `height` of the content box. If you are using the alternative box model, then the bigger the border is, the smaller the content box is, as the border takes up some of that available `width` and `height` of the element box.\n\n## Padding\nThe padding sits between the border and the content area and is used to push the content away from the border. Unlike margins, you cannot have a negative padding. Any background applied to your element will display behind the padding.\n\n## The box model and inline boxes\nAll of the above fully applies to block boxes. Some of the properties can apply to inline boxes too, such as those created by a `<span>` element.\n\n## Using display: inline-block\n`display: inline-block` is a special value of `display`, which provides a middle ground between `inline` and `block`. Use it if you do not want an item to break onto a new line, but do want it to respect `width` and `height` and avoid the overlapping seen above.\n\n## Test your skills!\nYou've reached the end of this article, but can you remember the most important information? You can find some further tests to verify that you've retained this information before you move on.\n\n## Summary\nThat's most of what you need to understand about the box model.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Document.getElementById()\"?\n\nAssistant: The getElementById() method of the Document interface returns an Element object representing the element whose id property matches the specified string.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Syntax\ngetElementById(id) \n\n**Note:** The capitalization of \"Id\" in the name of this method _must_ be correct for the code to function; getElementByID() is _not_ valid and will not work, however natural it may seem.\n\n## Parameters\n`id`\n\nThe ID of the element to locate. The ID is a case-sensitive string which is unique within the document; only one element should have any given ID.\n\n## Return value\nAn Element object describing the DOM element object matching the specified ID, or null if no matching element was found in the document.\n\n## Examples\n### HTML\n```html\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <title>getElementById example</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <p id=\"para\">Some text here</p>\n    <button onclick=\"changeColor('blue');\">blue</button>\n    <button onclick=\"changeColor('red');\">red</button>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### JavaScript\n```javascript\nfunction changeColor(newColor) {\n  const elem = document.getElementById(\"para\");\n  elem.style.color = newColor;\n}\n```\n\n### Result\n\n## Usage notes\nUnlike some other element-lookup methods such as Document.querySelector() and Document.querySelectorAll(), getElementById() is only available as a method of the global document object, and _not_ available as a method on all element objects in the DOM. Because ID values must be unique throughout the entire document, there is no need for \"local\" versions of the function.\n\n## Example\n```html\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang=\"en-US\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\" />\n    <title>Document</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"parent-id\">\n      <p>hello word1</p>\n      <p id=\"test1\">hello word2</p>\n      <p>hello word3</p>\n      <p>hello word4</p>\n    </div>\n    <script>\n      const parentDOM = document.getElementById(\"parent-id\");\n      const test1 = parentDOM.getElementById(\"test1\");\n      // throw error\n      // Uncaught TypeError: parentDOM.getElementById is not a function\n    </script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\nIf there is no element with the given id, this function returns null.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Element: click event\"?\n\nAssistant: An element receives a click event when any of the following occurs: a pointing-device button is pressed and released inside the element, a touch gesture is performed, or a user interaction equivalent to a click occurs.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## An overview of the click event\nAn element receives a **`click`** event when any of the following occurs:\n\n- A pointing-device button (such as a mouse's primary button) is both pressed and released while the pointer is located inside the element.\n- A touch gesture is performed on the element.\n- Any user interaction that is equivalent to a click, such as pressing the `Space` key or `Enter` key while the element is focused. Note that this only applies to elements with a default key event handler, and therefore, excludes other elements that have been made focusable by setting the [`tabindex`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/tabindex) attribute.\n\nIf the button is pressed on one element and the pointer is moved outside the element before the button is released, the event is fired on the most specific ancestor element that contained both elements.\n\n`click` fires after both the [`mousedown`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/mousedown_event \"mousedown\") and [`mouseup`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/mouseup_event \"mouseup\") events have fired, in that order.\n\nThe event is a device-independent event — meaning it can be activated by touch, keyboard, mouse, and any other mechanism provided by assistive technology.\n\n## Syntax\nUse the event name in methods like [`addEventListener()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener \"addEventListener()\"), or set an event handler property.\n\n## Event type\nA [`PointerEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PointerEvent). Inherits from [`MouseEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent).\n\n**Note:** In earlier versions of the specification, the event type for this event was a [`MouseEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent). Check [browser compatibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/click_event#browser_compatibility) for more information.\n\n## Event properties\n_This interface inherits properties from [`MouseEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MouseEvent) and [`Event`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event)._ \n\n- [`PointerEvent.altitudeAngle`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PointerEvent/altitudeAngle) Read onlyExperimental\n- [`PointerEvent.azimuthAngle`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PointerEvent/azimuthAngle) Read onlyExperimental\n- [`PointerEvent.pointerId`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PointerEvent/pointerId) Read only\n- [`PointerEvent.width`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PointerEvent/width) Read only\n- [`PointerEvent.height`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PointerEvent/height) Read only\n- [`PointerEvent.pressure`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PointerEvent/pressure) Read only\n- [`PointerEvent.tangentialPressure`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PointerEvent/tangentialPressure) Read only\n- [`PointerEvent.tiltX`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PointerEvent/tiltX) Read only\n- [`PointerEvent.tiltY`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PointerEvent/tiltY) Read only\n- [`PointerEvent.twist`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PointerEvent/twist) Read only\n- [`PointerEvent.pointerType`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PointerEvent/pointerType) Read only\n- [`PointerEvent.isPrimary`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PointerEvent/isPrimary) Read only\n\n## Usage notes\nThe [`PointerEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PointerEvent) object passed into the event handler for `click` has its [`detail`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/UIEvent/detail \"detail\") property set to the number of times the [`target`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/target \"target\") was clicked. In other words, `detail` will be 2 for a double-click, 3 for triple-click, and so forth. This counter resets after a short interval without any clicks occurring; the specifics of how long that interval is may vary from browser to browser and across platforms. The interval is also likely to be affected by user preferences; for example, accessibility options may extend this interval to make it easier to perform multiple clicks with adaptive interfaces.\n\n## Examples\nThis example displays the number of consecutive clicks on a [`<button>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button).\n\n### HTML\n```\n<button>Click</button>\n```\n\n### JavaScript\n```\nconst button = document.querySelector(\"button\");\n\nbutton.addEventListener(\"click\", (event) => {\n  button.textContent = `Click count: ${event.detail}`;\n});\n```\n\n### Result\nTry making rapid, repeated clicks on the button to increase the click count. If you take a break between clicks, the count will reset.\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [UI Events\\<br>\\# event-type-click](https://w3c.github.io/uievents/#event-type-click) |\n| [HTML\\<br>\\# handler-onclick](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#handler-onclick) |\n\n## Browser compatibility\nBCD tables only load in the browser\n\n## See also\n- [Learn: Introduction to events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Events)\n- [`auxclick`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/auxclick_event \"auxclick\")\n- [`contextmenu`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/contextmenu_event \"contextmenu\")\n- [`dblclick`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/dblclick_event \"dblclick\")\n- [`mousedown`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/mousedown_event \"mousedown\")\n- [`mouseup`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/mouseup_event \"mouseup\")\n- [`pointerdown`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/pointerdown_event \"pointerdown\")\n- [`pointerup`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/pointerup_event \"pointerup\")\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/click_event", "title": "Element: click event", "description": "An element receives a click event when any of the following occurs: a pointing-device button is pressed and released inside the element, a touch gesture is performed, or a user interaction equivalent to a click occurs.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 9, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 02:14:02", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/click_event", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "title": "Element: click event - Web APIs | MDN", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:title": "Element: click event - Web APIs | MDN", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "og:type": "website", "language": "en-US", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/click_event", "og:description": "An element receives a click event when any of the following occurs:", "og:image:height": "1080", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "ogTitle": "Element: click event - Web APIs | MDN", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Learn about the click event, including its type, syntax, and properties, code examples, specifications, and browser compatibility.", "og:locale": "en_US", "og:image:type": "image/png", "og:image:width": "1920", "position": ["1", "2", "3", "4"], "ogDescription": "An element receives a click event when any of the following occurs:", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "ogLocale": "en_US", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "scrapeId": "3f12a891-9424-4adb-99be-299b40ee0a29", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/click_event", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/click_event", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"HTMLElement.focus()\"?\n\nAssistant: The HTMLElement.focus() method sets focus on the specified element, if it can be focused. The focused element is the element that will receive keyboard and similar events by default.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Syntax\nfocus()\nfocus(options)\n\n## Parameters\n`options` Optional\n\nAn optional object for controlling aspects of the focusing process. This object may contain the following properties:\n\n`preventScroll` Optional\n\nA boolean value indicating whether or not the browser should scroll the document to bring the newly-focused element into view. A value of `false` for `preventScroll` (the default) means that the browser will scroll the element into view after focusing it. If `preventScroll` is set to `true`, no scrolling will occur.\n\n`focusVisible` OptionalExperimental\n\nA boolean value that should be set to `true` to force, or `false` to prevent visible indication that the element is focused. If the property is not specified, a browser will provide visible indication if it determines that this would improve accessibility for users.\n\n## Return value\nNone ( `undefined`).\n\n## Examples\n### Focus on a text field\nThis example uses a button to set the focus on a text field.\n\n#### HTML\n```\n<input id=\"myTextField\" value=\"Text field.\" />\n<button id=\"focusButton\">Click to set focus on the text field</button>\n```\n\n#### JavaScript\nThe code below adds an event handler to set the focus on the text field when the button is pressed. Note that most browsers will automatically add visible indication (a \"focus ring\") for a focused text field, so the code does not set `focusVisible` to `true`.\n```\ndocument.getElementById(\"focusButton\").addEventListener(\"click\", () => {\n  document.getElementById(\"myTextField\").focus();\n});\n```\n\n#### Result\nSelect the button to set focus on the text field.\n\n### Focus on a button\nThis example demonstrates how you can set the focus on a button element.\n\n#### HTML\nFirst we define three buttons. Both the middle and right button will set focus on the left-most button. The right-most button will also specify `focusVisible`.\n```\n<button id=\"myButton\">Button</button>\n<button id=\"focusButton\">Click to set focus on \"Button\"</button>\n<button id=\"focusButtonVisibleIndication\">\n  Click to set focus and focusVisible on \"Button\"\n</button>\n```\n\n#### JavaScript\nThe code below sets up handlers for click events on the middle and right buttons.\n```\ndocument.getElementById(\"focusButton\").addEventListener(\"click\", () => {\n  document.getElementById(\"myButton\").focus();\n});\n\ndocument\n  .getElementById(\"focusButtonVisibleIndication\")\n  .addEventListener(\"click\", () => {\n    document.getElementById(\"myButton\").focus({ focusVisible: true });\n  });\n```\n\n#### Result\nSelect either the middle button or right-most button to set focus on the left-most button.\n\n### Focus with and without scrolling\nThis example shows the effect of setting focus with the option `preventScroll` set `true` and `false` (the default).\n\n#### HTML\nThe HTML defines two buttons that will be used to set the focus of a third button that is off-screen\n```\n<button id=\"focus_scroll\">Click to set focus on off-screen button</button>\n<button id=\"focus_no_scroll\">\n  Click to set focus on offscreen button without scrolling\n</button>\n\n<div id=\"container\">\n  <button id=\"myButton\" style=\"margin-top: 500px;\">Button</button>\n</div>\n```\n\n#### JavaScript\nThis code sets a click event handler on the first and second buttons to set the focus on the last button. Note that the first handler doesn't specify the `preventScroll` option so scrolling to the focused element will be enabled.\n```\ndocument.getElementById(\"focus_scroll\").addEventListener(\"click\", () => {\n  document.getElementById(\"myButton\").focus(); // default: {preventScroll:false}\n});\n\ndocument.getElementById(\"focus_no_scroll\").addEventListener(\"click\", () => {\n  document.getElementById(\"myButton\").focus({ preventScroll: true });\n});\n```\n\n#### Result\nSelect the first button to set focus and scroll to the off-screen button. Selecting the second button set's the focus, but scrolling is disabled.\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [HTML<br># dom-focus-dev](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#dom-focus-dev) |\n\n## Notes\n- If you call `HTMLElement.focus()` from a mousedown event handler, you must call `event.preventDefault()` to keep the focus from leaving the `HTMLElement`\n- Behavior of the focus in relation to different HTML features like [`tabindex`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/tabindex) or [shadow dom](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Shadow_tree), which previously remained under-specified, were updated in October 2019.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Heading Elements\"?\n\nAssistant: The <h1> to <h6> HTML elements represent six levels of section headings. <h1> is the highest section level and <h6> is the lowest.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Try it\n```html\n<h1>Beetles</h1>\n<h2>External morphology</h2>\n<h3>Head</h3>\n<h4>Mouthparts</h4>\n<h3>Thorax</h3>\n<h4>Prothorax</h4>\n<h4>Pterothorax</h4>\n```\n\n## Attributes\nThese elements only include the global attributes.\n\n## Usage notes\n- Heading information can be used by user agents to construct a table of contents for a document automatically.\n- Do not use heading elements to resize text. Instead, use the CSS `font-size` property.\n- Do not skip heading levels: always start from <h1>, followed by <h2> and so on.\n\n## Avoid using multiple <h1> elements on one page\nWhile using multiple <h1> elements on one page is allowed by the HTML standard (as long as they are not nested), this is not considered a best practice. A page should generally have a single <h1> element that describes the content of the page (similar to the document's <title> element).\n\n## Specifying a uniform font size for <h1>\nThe HTML standard specifies that <h1> elements in a <section>, <article>, <aside>, or <nav> element should render as an <h2> (smaller font-size with an adjusted margin-block), or as an <h3> if nested another level, and so on.\n\n## Accessibility\nA common navigation technique for users of screen reading software is to quickly jump from heading to heading in order to determine the content of the page. Because of this, it is important to not skip one or more heading levels.\n\n## Labeling section content\nAnother common navigation technique for users of screen reading software is to generate a list of sectioning content and use it to determine the page's layout.\n\n## Examples\n### All headings\n```html\n<h1>Heading level 1</h1>\n<h2>Heading level 2</h2>\n<h3>Heading level 3</h3>\n<h4>Heading level 4</h4>\n<h5>Heading level 5</h5>\n<h6>Heading level 6</h6>\n```\n### Example page\n```html\n<h1>Heading elements</h1>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>Some text here…</p>\n<h2>Examples</h2>\n<h3>Example 1</h3>\n<p>Some text here…</p>\n<h3>Example 2</h3>\n<p>Some text here…</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<p>Some text here…</p>\n```\n\n## Technical summary\n| Content categories | Flow content, heading content, palpable content. |\n| Permitted content | Phrasing content. |\n| Tag omission | None, both the starting and ending tag are mandatory. |\n| Permitted parents | Any element that accepts flow content. |\n| Implicit ARIA role | heading |\n| Permitted ARIA roles | tab, presentation or none |\n| DOM interface | HTMLHeadingElement |\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| HTML# the-h1,-h2,-h3,-h4,-h5,-and-h6-elements |\n\n## Browser compatibility\n|  | desktop | mobile |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Chrome | Edge | Firefox | Opera | Safari | Chrome Android | Firefox for Android | Opera Android | Safari on iOS | Samsung Internet | WebView Android | WebView on iOS |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `h1` | Chrome – Full support<br>Chrome1<br>Toggle history | Edge – Full support<br>Edge12<br>Toggle history | Firefox – Full support<br>Firefox1<br>Toggle history | Opera – Full support<br>Opera15<br>Toggle history | Safari – Full support<br>Safari1<br>Toggle history | Chrome Android – Full support<br>Chrome Android18<br>Toggle history | Firefox for Android – Full support<br>Firefox for Android4<br>Toggle history | Opera Android – Full support<br>Opera Android14<br>Toggle history | Safari on iOS – Full support<br>Safari on iOS1<br>Toggle history | Samsung Internet – Full support<br>Samsung Internet1.0<br>Toggle history | WebView Android – Full support<br>WebView Android4.4<br>Toggle history | WebView on iOS – Full support<br>WebView on iOS1<br>Toggle history |\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements", "title": "Heading Elements", "description": "The <h1> to <h6> HTML elements represent six levels of section headings. <h1> is the highest section level and <h6> is the lowest.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 11, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 02:15:14", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:image:height": "1080", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "ogDescription": "The <h1> to <h6> HTML elements represent six levels of section headings. <h1> is the highest section level and <h6> is the lowest.

This option is a string and accepts one of the following values:\n\n- `start`: Aligns the element's top edge with the top of the scrollable container, making the element appear at the start of the visible area vertically.\n- `center`: Aligns the element vertically at the center of the scrollable container, positioning it in the middle of the visible area.\n- `end`: Aligns the element's bottom edge with the bottom of the scrollable container, placing the element at the end of the visible area vertically.\n- `nearest`: Scrolls the element to the nearest edge in the vertical direction. If the element is closer to the top edge of the scrollable container, it will align to the top; if it's closer to the bottom edge, it will align to the bottom. This minimizes the scrolling distance.\n- Defaults to `start`.\n\n**inline** Optional\n\nDefines the horizontal alignment of the element within the scrollable ancestor container. This option is a string and accepts one of the following values:\n\n- `start`: Aligns the element's left edge with the left of the scrollable container, making the element appear at the start of the visible area horizontally.\n- `center`: Aligns the element horizontally at the center of the scrollable container, positioning it in the middle of the visible area.\n- `end`: Aligns the element's right edge with the right of the scrollable container, placing the element at the end of the visible area horizontally.\n- `nearest`: Scrolls the element to the nearest edge in the horizontal direction. If the element is closer to the left edge of the scrollable container, it will align to the left; if it's closer to the right edge, it will align to the right. This minimizes the scrolling distance.\n- Defaults to `nearest`.\n\n## Return value\nNone ( `undefined`).\n\n## Examples\n### Using scrollIntoView()\n\n```javascript\nconst element = document.getElementById(\"box\");\n\nelement.scrollIntoView();\nelement.scrollIntoView(false);\nelement.scrollIntoView({ block: \"end\" });\nelement.scrollIntoView({ behavior: \"smooth\", block: \"end\", inline: \"nearest\" });\n```\n\n## Controlling top/bottom alignment\nBy default, the element is aligned to the top (or bottom) edge of the scrollable ancestor. To define a custom spacing, use `scroll-margin-top` or `scroll-margin-bottom`. This is often useful when there's a fixed header on the page.\n\n#### HTML\n\n```html\n<body>\n  <header class=\"navbar\">Navbar</header>\n  <main class=\"content\">\n    <button id=\"go-to-bottom\">Go to bottom</button>\n    <button id=\"go-to-top\">Go to top</button>\n  </main>\n</body>\n```\n\n#### CSS\n\n```css\n.navbar {\n  height: 50px;\n  position: sticky;\n  top: 0;\n  border-bottom: 1.5px solid black;\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: center;\n  align-items: center;\n}\n.content {\n  height: 2000px;\n  position: relative;\n}\n#go-to-bottom {\n  position: absolute;\n  top: 10px;\n  /* Without this, the button will be aligned to the top of the page\n  instead of bottom of navbar when scrolled */\n  scroll-margin-top: 60px;\n}\n#go-to-top {\n  position: absolute;\n  bottom: 10px;\n  scroll-margin-bottom: 0;\n}\n```\n\n#### JavaScript\n\n```javascript\nconst goToTop = document.getElementById(\"go-to-top\");\nconst goToBottom = document.getElementById(\"go-to-bottom\");\ngoToBottom.addEventListener(\"click\", () => {\n  goToTop.scrollIntoView({ behavior: \"instant\", block: \"end\" });\n});\ngoToTop.addEventListener(\"click\", () => {\n  goToBottom.scrollIntoView({ behavior: \"instant\", block: \"start\" });\n});\n```\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [CSSOM View Module<br># dom-element-scrollintoview](https://drafts.csswg.org/cssom-view/#dom-element-scrollintoview) |\n\n## Browser compatibility\nBCD tables only load in the browser\n\n## See also\n- [`Element.scrollIntoViewIfNeeded()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollIntoViewIfNeeded)Non-standard\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollIntoView", "title": "Element.scrollIntoView()", "description": "The Element interface's scrollIntoView() method scrolls the element's ancestor containers such that the element on which scrollIntoView() is called is visible to the user.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 8, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 02:16:13", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"title": "Element: scrollIntoView() method - Web APIs | MDN", "ogTitle": "Element: scrollIntoView() method - Web APIs | MDN", "og:locale": "en_US", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:image:height": "1080", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "og:image:width": "1920", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "position": ["1", "2", "3", "4"], "og:type": "website", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollIntoView", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Learn about the Element.scrollIntoView() method, including its syntax, code examples, specifications, and browser compatibility.", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollIntoView", "ogDescription": "The Element interface's\nscrollIntoView() method scrolls the element's ancestor\ncontainers such that the element on which scrollIntoView() is called is\nvisible to the user.", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:description": "The Element interface's\nscrollIntoView() method scrolls the element's ancestor\ncontainers such that the element on which scrollIntoView() is called is\nvisible to the user.", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "ogLocale": "en_US", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "og:image:type": "image/png", "og:title": "Element: scrollIntoView() method - Web APIs | MDN", "language": "en-US", "scrapeId": "0fe4b22e-227b-4376-b0f4-c4f1cd2dc78e", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollIntoView", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollIntoView", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Window.localStorage\"?\n\nAssistant: The localStorage read-only property of the window interface allows you to access a Storage object for the Document's origin; the stored data is saved across browser sessions.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Value\nA Storage object which can be used to access the current origin's local storage space.\n\n## Exceptions\nSecurityError\n\nThrown in one of the following cases:\n\n- The origin is not a valid scheme/host/port tuple. This can happen if the origin uses the file: or data: schemes, for example.\n- The request violates a policy decision. For example, the user has configured the browsers to prevent the page from persisting data.\n\nNote that if the user blocks cookies, browsers will probably interpret this as an instruction to prevent the page from persisting data.\n\n## Description\nThe keys and the values stored with localStorage are always in the UTF-16 string format, which uses two bytes per character. As with objects, integer keys are automatically converted to strings.\n\nlocalStorage data is specific to the protocol of the document. In particular, for a site loaded over HTTP (e.g., http://example.com), localStorage returns a different object than localStorage for the corresponding site loaded over HTTPS (e.g., https://example.com).\n\nFor documents loaded from file: URLs (that is, files opened in the browser directly from the user's local filesystem, rather than being served from a web server) the requirements for localStorage behavior are undefined and may vary among different browsers.\n\nIn all current browsers, localStorage seems to return a different object for each file: URL. In other words, each file: URL seems to have its own unique local-storage area. But there are no guarantees about that behavior, so you shouldn't rely on it because, as mentioned above, the requirements for file: URLs remain undefined. So it's possible that browsers may change their file: URL handling for localStorage at any time. In fact some browsers have changed their handling for it over time.\n\n## Examples\nThe following snippet accesses the current domain's local Storage object and adds a data item to it using Storage.setItem().\n\n```javascript\nlocalStorage.setItem(\"myCat\", \"Tom\");\n```\n\nThe syntax for reading the localStorage item is as follows:\n\n```javascript\nconst cat = localStorage.getItem(\"myCat\");\n```\n\nThe syntax for removing the localStorage item is as follows:\n\n```javascript\nlocalStorage.removeItem(\"myCat\");\n```\n\nThe syntax for removing all the localStorage items is as follows:\n\n```javascript\nlocalStorage.clear();\n```\n\nNote: Please refer to the Using the Web Storage API article for a full example.\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [HTML<br># dom-localstorage-dev](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webstorage.html#dom-localstorage-dev) |\n\n## Browser compatibility\n|  | desktop | mobile | server |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Chrome | Edge | Firefox | Opera | Safari | Chrome Android | Firefox for Android | Opera Android | Safari on iOS | Samsung Internet | WebView Android | WebView on iOS | Deno |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| localStorage | Chrome – Full support<br>Chrome4<br>Toggle history | Edge – Full support<br>Edge12<br>Toggle history | Firefox – Full support<br>Firefox3.5<br>Toggle history | Opera – Full support<br>Opera10.5<br>Toggle history | Safari – Full support<br>Safari4<br>Toggle history | Chrome Android – Full support<br>Chrome Android18<br>Toggle history | Firefox for Android – Full support<br>Firefox for Android4<br>Toggle history | Opera Android – Full support<br>Opera Android11<br>Toggle history | Safari on iOS – Full support<br>Safari on iOS3.2<br>Toggle history | Samsung Internet – Full support<br>Samsung Internet1.0<br>Toggle history | WebView Android – Full support<br>WebView Android37<br>Toggle history | WebView on iOS – Full support<br>WebView on iOS3.2<br>Toggle history | Deno – Full support<br>Deno1.16<br>footnote<br>Toggle history |\n\n## See also\n- [Using the Web Storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API/Using_the_Web_Storage_API)\n- [Window.sessionStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage", "title": "Window.localStorage", "description": "The localStorage read-only property of the window interface allows you to access a Storage object for the Document's origin; the stored data is saved across browser sessions.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 7, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 02:16:39", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:title": "Window: localStorage property - Web APIs | MDN", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "og:image:height": "1080", "og:image:type": "image/png", "description": "Learn about the Window.localStorage property, including its type, code examples, specifications, and browser compatibility.", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "ogLocale": "en_US", "og:locale": "en_US", "og:description": "The localStorage read-only property of the window interface allows you to access a Storage object for the Document's origin; the stored data is saved across browser sessions.", "og:image:width": "1920", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "ogTitle": "Window: localStorage property - Web APIs | MDN", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:type": "website", "language": "en-US", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage", "position": ["1", "2", "3", "4"], "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "title": "Window: localStorage property - Web APIs | MDN", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "ogDescription": "The localStorage read-only property of the window interface allows you to access a Storage object for the Document's origin; the stored data is saved across browser sessions.", "scrapeId": "f5a1feac-3b1d-43b8-b86d-483b6b131b5b", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage", "statusCode": 200}}}

If the class attribute is not set or empty, it returns an empty DOMTokenList, i.e. a DOMTokenList with the length property equal to 0.\n\nAlthough the classList property itself is read-only, you can modify its associated DOMTokenList using the add(), remove(), replace(), and toggle() methods.\n\nYou can test whether the element contains a given class using the classList.contains() method.\n\n## Examples\n```javascript\nconst div = document.createElement(\"div\");\ndiv.className = \"foo\";\n\n// our starting state: <div class=\"foo\"></div>\nconsole.log(div.outerHTML);\n\n// use the classList API to remove and add classes\ndiv.classList.remove(\"foo\");\ndiv.classList.add(\"another-class\");\n\n// <div class=\"another-class\"></div>\nconsole.log(div.outerHTML);\n\n// if visible is set remove it, otherwise add it\ndiv.classList.toggle(\"visible\");\n\n// add/remove visible, depending on test conditional, i less than 10\ndiv.classList.toggle(\"visible\", i < 10);\n\n// false\nconsole.log(div.classList.contains(\"foo\"));\n\n// add or remove multiple classes\ndiv.classList.add(\"foo\", \"bar\", \"baz\");\ndiv.classList.remove(\"foo\", \"bar\", \"baz\");\n\n// add or remove multiple classes using spread syntax\nconst cls = [\"foo\", \"bar\"];\ndiv.classList.add(...cls);\ndiv.classList.remove(...cls);\n\n// replace class \"foo\" with class \"bar\"\ndiv.classList.replace(\"foo\", \"bar\");\n```\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [DOM<br># ref-for-dom-element-classlist①](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#ref-for-dom-element-classlist%E2%91%A0) |\n\n## Browser compatibility\n|  | desktop | mobile |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Chrome | Edge | Firefox | Opera | Safari | Chrome Android | Firefox for Android | Opera Android | Safari on iOS | Samsung Internet | WebView Android | WebView on iOS |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `classList` | Chrome – Full support<br>Chrome22<br>more<br>Toggle history | Edge – Full support<br>Edge16<br>more<br>Toggle history | Firefox – Full support<br>Firefox3.6<br>Toggle history | Opera – Full support<br>Opera11.5<br>Toggle history | Safari – Full support<br>Safari7<br>more<br>Toggle history | Chrome Android – Full support<br>Chrome Android25<br>more<br>Toggle history | Firefox for Android – Full support<br>Firefox for Android4<br>Toggle history | Opera Android – Full support<br>Opera Android11.5<br>Toggle history | Safari on iOS – Full support<br>Safari on iOS7<br>more<br>Toggle history | Samsung Internet – Full support<br>Samsung Internet1.5<br>more<br>Toggle history | WebView Android – Full support<br>WebView Android4.4<br>more<br>Toggle history | WebView on iOS – Full support<br>WebView on iOS7<br>more<br>Toggle history |\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/classList", "title": "Element.classList", "description": "The `Element.classList` is a read-only property that returns a live DOMTokenList collection of the class attributes of the element.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \":not()\"?\n\nAssistant: The :not() CSS pseudo-class represents elements that do not match a list of selectors. Since it prevents specific items from being selected, it is known as the negation pseudo-class.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Try it\nCSS Demo: :not\n\nThe interactive example cannot be shown because MathML is not supported by your browser.\n\n## Syntax\nThe :not() pseudo-class requires a selector list, a comma-separated list of one or more selectors, as its argument. The list must not contain a pseudo-element, but any other simple, compound, and complex selectors are allowed.\n\n## Description\nThere are several unusual effects and outcomes when using :not() that you should keep in mind when using it:\n\n- Useless selectors can be written using this pseudo-class. For example, :not(*) matches any element which is not an element, which is obviously nonsense, so the accompanying rule will never be applied.\n- This pseudo-class can increase the specificity of a rule. For example, #foo:not(#bar) will match the same element as the simpler #foo, but has the higher specificity of two id selectors.\n- The specificity of the :not() pseudo-class is replaced by the specificity of the most specific selector in its comma-separated argument of selectors; providing the same specificity as if it had been written :not(:is(argument)).\n- :not(.foo) will match anything that isn't .foo, including <html> and <body>.\n- This selector will match everything that is \"not an X\". This may be surprising when used with descendant combinators, since there are multiple paths to select a target element. For instance, body :not(table) a will still apply to links inside a <table>, since <tr>, <tbody>, <th>, <td>, <caption>, etc. can all match the :not(table) part of the selector. To avoid this, you can use body a:not(table a) instead, which will only apply to links that are not descendants of a table.\n- You can negate several selectors at the same time. Example: :not(.foo, .bar) is equivalent to :not(.foo):not(.bar).\n- If any selector passed to the :not() pseudo-class is invalid or not supported by the browser, the whole rule will be invalidated. The effective way to overcome this behavior is to use :is() pseudo-class, which accepts a forgiving selector list. For example :not(.foo, :invalid-pseudo-class) will invalidate a whole rule, but :not(:is(.foo, :invalid-pseudo-class)) will match any (including <html> and <body>) element that isn't .foo.\n\n## Examples\n### Using :not() with valid selectors\nThis example shows some a few examples of using :not().\n\n#### HTML\n\n<p>I am a paragraph.</p>\n<p class=\"fancy\">I am so very fancy!</p>\n<div>I am NOT a paragraph.</div>\n<h2>\n  <span class=\"foo\">foo inside h2</span>\n  <span class=\"bar\">bar inside h2</span>\n</h2>\n\n#### CSS\n\n.fancy {\n  text-shadow: 2px 2px 3px gold;\n}\n\n/* <p> elements that don't have a class `.fancy` */\np:not(.fancy) {\n  color: green;\n}\n\n/* Elements that are not <p> elements */\nbody :not(p) {\n  text-decoration: underline;\n}\n\n/* Elements that are not <div>s or `.fancy` */\nbody :not(div):not(.fancy) {\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n\n/* Elements that are not <div>s or `.fancy` */\nbody :not(div, .fancy) {\n  text-decoration: overline underline;\n}\n\n/* Elements inside an <h2> that aren't a <span> with a class of `.foo` */\nh2 :not(span.foo) {\n  color: red;\n}\n\n### Using :not() with invalid selectors\nThis example shows the use of :not() with invalid selectors and how to prevent invalidation.\n\n#### HTML\n\n<p class=\"foo\">I am a paragraph with .foo</p>\n<p class=\"bar\">I am a paragraph with .bar</p>\n<div>I am a div without a class</div>\n<div class=\"foo\">I am a div with .foo</div>\n<div class=\"bar\">I am a div with .bar</div>\n<div class=\"foo bar\">I am a div with .foo and .bar</div>\n\n#### CSS\n\n/* Invalid rule, does nothing */\np:not(.foo, :invalid-pseudo-class) {\n  color: red;\n  font-style: italic;\n}\n\n/* Select all <p> elements without the `foo` class */\np:not(:is(.foo, :invalid-pseudo-class)) {\n  color: green;\n  border-top: dotted thin currentcolor;\n}\n\n/* Select all <div> elements without the `foo` or the `bar` class */\ndiv:not(.foo, .bar) {\n  color: red;\n  font-style: italic;\n}\n\n/* Select all <div> elements without the `foo` or the `bar` class */\ndiv:not(:is(.foo, .bar)) {\n  border-bottom: dotted thin currentcolor;\n}\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:not", "title": ":not()", "description": "The :not() CSS pseudo-class represents elements that do not match a list of selectors.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"HTMLElement: change event\"?\n\nAssistant: The `change` event is fired for `<input>`, `<select>`, and `<textarea>` elements when the user modifies the element's value. It differs from the `input` event in that it does not fire for every alteration to the element's value.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Overview\nThe `change` event is fired for `<input>`, `<select>`, and `<textarea>` elements when the user modifies the element's value. Unlike the `input` event, the `change` event is not necessarily fired for each alteration to an element's `value`.\n\nDepending on the kind of element being changed and the way the user interacts with the element, the `change` event fires at a different moment:\n\n- When a `<input type=\"checkbox\">` element is checked or unchecked (by clicking or using the keyboard);\n- When a `<input type=\"radio\">` element is checked (but not when unchecked);\n- When the user commits the change explicitly (e.g., by selecting a value from a `<select>`'s dropdown with a mouse click, by selecting a date from a date picker for `<input type=\"date\">`, by selecting a file in the file picker for `<input type=\"file\">`, etc.);\n- When the element loses focus after its value was changed: for elements where the user's interaction is typing rather than selection, such as a `<textarea>` or the `text`, `search`, `url`, `tel`, `email`, or `password` types of the `<input>` element.\n\nThe HTML specification lists the `<input>` types that should fire the `change` event.\n\n## Syntax\nUse the event name in methods like `addEventListener()`, or set an event handler property.\n\n## Event type\nA generic `Event`.\n\n## Examples\n### <select> element\n#### HTML\n```html\n<label>\n  Choose an ice cream flavor:\n  <select class=\"ice-cream\" name=\"ice-cream\">\n    <option value=\"\">Select One …</option>\n    <option value=\"chocolate\">Chocolate</option>\n    <option value=\"sardine\">Sardine</option>\n    <option value=\"vanilla\">Vanilla</option>\n  </select>\n</label>\n\n<div class=\"result\"></div>\n```\n```css\nbody {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-areas: \"select result\";\n}\n\nselect {\n  grid-area: select;\n}\n\n.result {\n  grid-area: result;\n}\n```\n#### JavaScript\n```javascript\nconst selectElement = document.querySelector(\".ice-cream\");\nconst result = document.querySelector(\".result\");\n\nselectElement.addEventListener(\"change\", (event) => {\n  result.textContent = `You like ${event.target.value}`;\n});\n```\n#### Result\n\n### Text input element\nFor some elements, including `<input type=\"text\">`, the `change` event doesn't fire until the control loses focus. Try entering something into the field below, and then click somewhere else to trigger the event.\n#### HTML\n```html\n<input placeholder=\"Enter some text\" name=\"name\" />\n<p id=\"log\"></p>\n```\n#### JavaScript\n```javascript\nconst input = document.querySelector(\"input\");\nconst log = document.getElementById(\"log\");\n\ninput.addEventListener(\"change\", updateValue);\n\nfunction updateValue(e) {\n  log.textContent = e.target.value;\n}\n```\n#### Result\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/change_event", "title": "HTMLElement: change event", "description": "The `change` event is fired for `<input>`, `<select>`, and `<textarea>` elements when the user modifies the element's value.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"beforeunload event\"?\n\nAssistant: The `beforeunload` event is fired when the current window, contained document, and associated resources are about to be unloaded. It is used to trigger a confirmation dialog to prevent loss of unsaved data.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Overview\nThe `beforeunload` event is fired when the current window, contained document, and associated resources are about to be unloaded. The document is still visible and the event is still cancelable at this point.\n\nThe main use case for this event is to trigger a browser-generated confirmation dialog that asks users to confirm if they _really_ want to leave the page when they try to close or reload it, or navigate somewhere else. This is intended to help prevent loss of unsaved data.\n\n## Triggering the Dialog\nThe dialog can be triggered in the following ways:\n\n- Calling the event object's [`preventDefault()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/preventDefault \"preventDefault()\") method.\n- Setting the event object's [`returnValue`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/BeforeUnloadEvent/returnValue \"returnValue\") property to a non-empty string value or any other [truthy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy) value.\n- Returning any truthy value from the event handler function, e.g. `return \"string\"`. Note that this only works when the function is attached via the `onbeforeunload` property, not the [`addEventListener()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener \"addEventListener()\") method. This behavior is consistent across modern versions of Firefox, Safari, and Chrome.\n\nThe last two mechanisms are legacy features; best practice is to trigger the dialog by invoking `preventDefault()` on the event object, while also setting `returnValue` to support legacy cases.\n\n## Syntax\nUse the event name in methods like [`addEventListener()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener \"addEventListener()\"), or set an event handler property.\n\n```javascript\naddEventListener(\"beforeunload\", (event) => {});\nonbeforeunload = (event) => {};\n```\n\n## Event Type\nA [`BeforeUnloadEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/BeforeUnloadEvent). Inherits from [`Event`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event).\n\n## Usage Notes\nTo trigger the dialog being shown when the user closes or navigates the tab, a `beforeunload` event handler function should call [`preventDefault()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/preventDefault \"preventDefault()\") on the event object. You should note that modern implementations:\n\n- Require [sticky activation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Sticky_activation) for the dialog to be displayed. In other words, the browser will only show the dialog box if the frame or any embedded frame receives a user gesture or user interaction. If the user has never interacted with the page, then there is no user data to save, so no legitimate use case for the dialog.\n- Only show a generic browser-specified string in the displayed dialog. This cannot be controlled by the webpage code.\n\nThe `beforeunload` event suffers from some problems:\n\n- It is not reliably fired, especially on mobile platforms. For example, the `beforeunload` event is not fired at all in the following scenario:\n\n1. A mobile user visits your page.\n2. The user then switches to a different app.\n3. Later, the user closes the browser from the app manager.\n\n**Note:** It is recommended to use the [`visibilitychange`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/visibilitychange_event \"visibilitychange\") event as a more reliable signal for automatic app state saving that gets around problems like the above. See [Don't lose user and app state, use Page Visibility](https://www.igvita.com/2015/11/20/dont-lose-user-and-app-state-use-page-visibility/) for more details.\n\n- In Firefox, `beforeunload` is not compatible with the [back/forward cache](https://web.dev/articles/bfcache) (bfcache): that is, Firefox will not place pages in the bfcache if they have `beforeunload` listeners, and this is bad for performance.\n\nIt is therefore recommended that developers listen for `beforeunload` only when users have unsaved changes so that the dialog mentioned above can be used to warn them about impending data loss, and remove the listener again when it is not needed. Listening for `beforeunload` sparingly can minimize the effect on performance.\n\n## Event Handler Aliases\nIn addition to the `Window` interface, the event handler property `onbeforeunload` is also available on the following targets:\n- [`HTMLBodyElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLBodyElement)\n- [`HTMLFrameSetElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFrameSetElement)\n- [`SVGSVGElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SVGSVGElement)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/beforeunload_event", "title": "beforeunload event", "description": "The `beforeunload` event is fired when the current window, contained document, and associated resources are about to be unloaded.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Window: load event\"?\n\nAssistant: The load event is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets, scripts, iframes, and images.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Overview\nThe **`load`** event is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets, scripts, iframes, and images, except those that are loaded lazily. This is in contrast to [`DOMContentLoaded`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/DOMContentLoaded_event), which is fired as soon as the page DOM has been loaded, without waiting for resources to finish loading.\n\nThis event is not cancelable and does not bubble.\n\n**Note:** _All events named `load` will not propagate to `Window`_, even with `bubbles` initialized to `true`. To catch `load` events on the `window`, that `load` event must be dispatched directly to the `window`.\n\n**Note:** The `load` event that is dispatched when the main document has loaded _is_ dispatched on the `window`, but has two mutated properties: `target` is `document`, and `path` is `undefined`. These two properties are mutated due to legacy conformance.\n\n## Syntax\nUse the event name in methods like [`addEventListener()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener), or set an event handler property.\n\n## Event type\nA generic [`Event`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event).\n\n## Examples\nLog a message when the page is fully loaded:\n\n```javascript\nwindow.addEventListener(\"load\", (event) => {\n  console.log(\"page is fully loaded\");\n});\n```\n\nThe same, but using the `onload` event handler property:\n\n```javascript\nwindow.onload = (event) => {\n  console.log(\"page is fully loaded\");\n};\n```\n\n## Live example\n#### HTML\n\n```html\n<div class=\"controls\">\n  <button id=\"reload\" type=\"button\">Reload</button>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"event-log\">\n  <label for=\"eventLog\">Event log:</label>\n  <textarea\n    readonly\n    class=\"event-log-contents\"\n    rows=\"8\"\n    cols=\"30\"\n    id=\"eventLog\"></textarea>\n</div>\n```\n\n```css\nbody {\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-areas: \"control log\";\n}\n\n.controls {\n  grid-area: control;\n  display: flex;\n  align-items: center;\n  justify-content: center;\n}\n\n.event-log {\n  grid-area: log;\n}\n\n.event-log-contents {\n  resize: none;\n}\n\nlabel,\nbutton {\n  display: block;\n}\n\n#reload {\n  height: 2rem;\n}\n```\n\n#### JavaScript\n\n```javascript\nconst log = document.querySelector(\".event-log-contents\");\nconst reload = document.querySelector(\"#reload\");\n\nreload.addEventListener(\"click\", () => {\n  log.textContent = \"\";\n  setTimeout(() => {\n    window.location.reload(true);\n  }, 200);\n});\n\nwindow.addEventListener(\"load\", (event) => {\n  log.textContent += \"load\\n\";\n});\n\ndocument.addEventListener(\"readystatechange\", (event) => {\n  log.textContent += `readystate: ${document.readyState}\\n`;\n});\n\ndocument.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", (event) => {\n  log.textContent += `DOMContentLoaded\\n`;\n});\n```\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [UI Events<br># event-type-load](https://w3c.github.io/uievents/#event-type-load) |\n| [HTML<br># delay-the-load-event](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/parsing.html#delay-the-load-event) |\n\n## Browser compatibility\n\n\n## See also\n- Document [readyState](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/readyState) API\n- Related events:\n  -

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Functions\"?\n\nAssistant: This page provides an overview of functions in JavaScript, including their definitions, types, and usage.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Description\nFunction values are typically instances of `Function`. See `Function` for information on properties and methods of `Function` objects. Callable values cause `typeof` to return \"function\" instead of \"object\".\n\n**Note:** Not all callable values are `instanceof Function`. For example, the `Function.prototype` object is callable but not an instance of `Function`. You can also manually set the prototype chain of your function so it no longer inherits from `Function.prototype`. However, such cases are extremely rare.\n\n## Return value\nBy default, if a function's execution doesn't end at a `return` statement, or if the `return` keyword doesn't have an expression after it, then the return value is `undefined`. The `return` statement allows you to return an arbitrary value from the function. One function call can only return one value, but you can simulate the effect of returning multiple values by returning an object or array and destructuring the result.\n\n**Note:** Constructors called with `new` have a different set of logic to determine their return values.\n\n## Passing arguments\nParameters and arguments have slightly different meanings, but in MDN web docs, we often use them interchangeably. For a quick reference:\n\n```javascript\nfunction formatNumber(num) {\n  return num.toFixed(2);\n}\n\nformatNumber(2);\n```\n\nIn this example, the `num` variable is called the function's parameter: it's declared in the parenthesis-enclosed list of the function's definition. The function expects the `num` parameter to be a number — although this is not enforceable in JavaScript without writing runtime validation code. In the `formatNumber(2)` call, the number `2` is the function's argument: it's the value that is actually passed to the function in the function call. The argument value can be accessed inside the function body through the corresponding parameter name or the `arguments` object.\n\nArguments are always passed by value and never passed by reference. This means that if a function reassigns a parameter, the value won't change outside the function. More precisely, object arguments are passed by sharing, which means if the object's properties are mutated, the change will impact the outside of the function. For example:\n\n```javascript\nfunction updateBrand(obj) {\n  // Mutating the object is visible outside the function\n  obj.brand = \"Toyota\";\n  // Try to reassign the parameter, but this won't affect\n  // the variable's value outside the function\n  obj = null;\n}\n\nconst car = {\n  brand: \"Honda\",\n  model: \"Accord\",\n  year: 1998,\n};\n\nconsole.log(car.brand); // Honda\n\n// Pass object reference to the function\nupdateBrand(car);\n\n// updateBrand mutates car\nconsole.log(car.brand); // Toyota\n```\n\nThe `this` keyword refers to the object that the function is accessed on — it does not refer to the currently executing function, so you must refer to the function value by name, even within the function body.\n\n## Defining functions\nBroadly speaking, JavaScript has four kinds of functions:\n\n- Regular function: can return anything; always runs to completion after invocation\n- Generator function: returns a `Generator` object; can be paused and resumed with the `yield` operator\n- Async function: returns a `Promise`; can be paused and resumed with the `await` operator\n- Async generator function: returns an `AsyncGenerator` object; both the `await` and `yield` operators can be used\n\nFor every kind of function, there are multiple ways to define it:\n\n**Declaration**\n\n```javascript\nfunction multiply(x, y) {\n  return x * y;\n}\n```\n\n**Expression**\n\n```javascript\nconst multiply = function (x, y) {\n  return x * y;\n};\n```\n\n**Arrow function**\n\n```javascript\nconst multiply = (x, y) => x * y;\n```\n\nAll syntaxes do approximately the same thing, but there are some subtle behavior differences.\n\n## Function parameters\nEach function parameter is a simple identifier that you can access in the local scope.\n\n```javascript\nfunction myFunc(a, b, c) {\n  // You can access the values of a, b, and c here\n}\n```\n\nThere are three special parameter syntaxes:\n\n- Default parameters allow formal parameters to be initialized with default values if no value or `undefined` is passed.\n- The rest parameter allows representing an indefinite number of arguments as an array.\n- Destructuring allows unpacking elements from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.\n\n```javascript\nfunction myFunc({ a, b }, c = 1, ...rest) {\n  // You can access the values of a, b, c, and rest here\n}\n```\n\n## The arguments object\nYou can refer to a function's arguments within the function by using the `arguments` object.\n\n`arguments` is an array-like object containing the arguments passed to the currently executing function.\n\n## Getter and setter functions\nYou can define accessor properties on any standard built-in object or user-defined object that supports the addition of new properties. Within object literals and classes, you can use special syntaxes to define the getter and setter of an accessor property.\n\n## Block-level functions\nIn strict mode, functions inside blocks are scoped to that block. Prior to ES2015, block-level functions were forbidden in strict mode.\n\n## Examples\n### Returning a formatted number\n\nThe following function returns a string containing the formatted representation of a number padded with leading zeros.\n\n```javascript\nfunction padZeros(num, totalLen) {\n  let numStr = num.toString();\n  const numZeros = totalLen - numStr.length;\n  for (let i = 1; i <= numZeros; i++) {\n    numStr = `0${numStr}`;\n  }\n  return numStr;\n}\n```\n\nThe following statements call the `padZeros` function.\n\n```javascript\nlet result;\nresult = padZeros(42, 4); // returns \"0042\"\nresult = padZeros(42, 2); // returns \"42\"\nresult = padZeros(5, 4); // returns \"0005\"\n```\n\n### Determining whether a function exists\n\nYou can determine whether a function exists by using the `typeof` operator. In the following example, a test is performed to determine if the `window` object has a property called `noFunc` that is a function. If so, it is used; otherwise, some other action is taken.\n\n```javascript\nif (typeof window.noFunc === \"function\") {\n  // use noFunc()\n} else {\n  // do something else\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions", "title": "Functions", "description": "This page provides an overview of functions in JavaScript, including their definitions, types, and usage.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 9, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 02:24:43", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"ogDescription": "Generally speaking, a function is a \"subprogram\" that can be called by code external (or internal, in the case of recursion) to the function.

If `condition` is any of these, the result of the conditional expression will be the result of executing the expression `exprIfFalse`.\n\n## Examples\n### A basic example\n\n```javascript\nconst age = 26;\nconst beverage = age >= 21 ? \"Beer\" : \"Juice\";\nconsole.log(beverage); // \"Beer\"\n```\n\n### Handling null values\n\nOne common usage is to handle a value that may be `null`:\n\n```javascript\nconst greeting = (person) => {\n  const name = person ? person.name : \"stranger\";\n  return `Howdy, ${name}`;\n};\n\nconsole.log(greeting({ name: \"Alice\" })); // \"Howdy, Alice\"\nconsole.log(greeting(null)); // \"Howdy, stranger\"\n```\n\n### Conditional chains\n\nThe ternary operator is right-associative, which means it can be \"chained\" in the following way, similar to an `if … else if … else if … else` chain:\n\n```javascript\nfunction example() {\n  return condition1 ? value1\n    : condition2 ? value2\n    : condition3 ? value3\n    : value4;\n}\n```\n\nThis is equivalent to the following `if...else` chain:\n\n```javascript\nfunction example() {\n  if (condition1) {\n    return value1;\n  } else if (condition2) {\n    return value2;\n  } else if (condition3) {\n    return value3;\n  } else {\n    return value4;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [ECMAScript® 2025 Language Specification<br># sec-conditional-operator](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/ecmascript-language-expressions.html#sec-conditional-operator) |\n\n## Browser compatibility\n|  | desktop | mobile | server |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Chrome | Edge | Firefox | Opera | Safari | Chrome Android | Firefox for Android | Opera Android | Safari on iOS | Samsung Internet | WebView Android | WebView on iOS | Deno | Node.js |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Conditional operator ( `c ?

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Data URLs\"?\n\nAssistant: Data URLs, URLs prefixed with the data: scheme, allow content creators to embed small files inline in documents. They were formerly known as 'data URIs' until that name was retired by the WHATWG.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Syntax\nData URLs are composed of four parts: a prefix (data:), a MIME type indicating the type of data, an optional base64 token if non-textual, and the data itself:\n\ndata:[<media-type>][;base64],<data>\n\nThe media-type is a MIME type string, such as 'image/jpeg' for a JPEG image file. If omitted, defaults to text/plain;charset=US-ASCII.\n\nIf the data contains characters defined in RFC 3986 as reserved characters, or contains space characters, newline characters, or other non-printing characters, those characters must be percent-encoded.\n\nIf the data is textual, you can embed the text (using the appropriate entities or escapes based on the enclosing document's type). Otherwise, you can specify base64 to embed base64-encoded binary data. You can find more info on MIME types here and here.\n\n## Examples\nA few examples:\n\n[data:,Hello%2C%20World%21](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Reference/Schemes/data#datahello2c20world21)\nThe text/plain data Hello, World!. Note how the comma is percent-encoded as %2C, and the space character as %20.\n\n[data:text/plain;base64,SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Reference/Schemes/data#datatextplainbase64sgvsbg8sifdvcmxkiq)\nbase64-encoded version of the above.\n\n[data:text/html,%3Ch1%3EHello%2C%20World%21%3C%2Fh1%3E](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Reference/Schemes/data#datatexthtml3ch13ehello2c20world213c2fh13e)\nAn HTML document with <h1>Hello, World!</h1>.\n\n[data:text/html,%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%27hi%27%29%3B%3C%2Fscript%3E](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Reference/Schemes/data#datatexthtml3cscript3ealert2827hi27293b3c2fscript3e)\nAn HTML document with <script>alert('hi');</script> that executes a JavaScript alert. Note that the closing script tag is required.\n\n## Encoding data into base64 format\nBase64 is a group of binary-to-text encoding schemes that represent binary data in an ASCII string format by translating it into a radix-64 representation. By consisting only of characters permitted by the URL syntax (\"URL safe\"), we can safely encode binary data in data URLs. Base64 uses the characters + and /, which may have special meanings in URLs. Because Data URLs have no URL path segments or query parameters, this encoding is safe in this context.\n\n## Common problems\nThis section describes problems that commonly occur when creating and using data URLs.\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [The \"data\" URL scheme# section-2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2397#section-2)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Reference/Schemes/data", "title": "Data URLs", "description": "Data URLs, URLs prefixed with the data: scheme, allow content creators to embed small files inline in documents.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Default parameters\"?\n\nAssistant: Default function parameters allow named parameters to be initialized with default values if no value or undefined is passed.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Try it\n```javascript\nfunction multiply(a, b = 1) {\n  return a * b;\n}\n\nconsole.log(multiply(5, 2));\n// Expected output: 10\n\nconsole.log(multiply(5));\n// Expected output: 5\n```\n\n## Syntax\n```javascript\nfunction fnName(param1 = defaultValue1, /* …, */ paramN = defaultValueN) {\n  // …\n}\n```\n\n## Description\nIn JavaScript, function parameters default to `undefined`. However, it's often useful to set a different default value. This is where default parameters can help.\n\nIn the following example, if no value is provided for `b` when `multiply` is called, `b`'s value would be `undefined` when evaluating `a * b` and `multiply` would return `NaN`.\n\n```javascript\nfunction multiply(a, b) {\n  return a * b;\n}\n\nmultiply(5, 2); // 10\nmultiply(5); // NaN !\n```\n\nIn the past, the general strategy for setting defaults was to test parameter values in the function body and assign a value if they are `undefined`. In the following example, `b` is set to `1` if `multiply` is called with only one argument:\n\n```javascript\nfunction multiply(a, b) {\n  b = typeof b !== \"undefined\" ? b : 1;\n  return a * b;\n}\n\nmultiply(5, 2); // 10\nmultiply(5); // 5\n```\n\nWith default parameters, checks in the function body are no longer necessary. Now, you can assign `1` as the default value for `b` in the function head:\n\n```javascript\nfunction multiply(a, b = 1) {\n  return a * b;\n}\n\nmultiply(5, 2); // 10\nmultiply(5); // 5\nmultiply(5, undefined); // 5\n```\n\nParameters are still set left-to-right, overwriting default parameters even if there are later parameters without defaults.\n\n```javascript\nfunction f(x = 1, y) {\n  return [x, y];\n}\n\nf(); // [1, undefined]\nf(2); // [2, undefined]\n```\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Default_parameters", "title": "Default parameters", "description": "Default function parameters allow named parameters to be initialized with default values if no value or undefined is passed.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 3, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 02:27:54", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:image:width": "1920", "og:type": "website", "og:image:height": "1080", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "title": "Default parameters - JavaScript | MDN", "og:description": "Default function parameters allow named parameters to be initialized with default values if no value or undefined is passed.", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "ogLocale": "en_US", "position": ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"], "og:locale": "en_US", "og:image:type": "image/png", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:title": "Default parameters - JavaScript | MDN", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Default_parameters", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "ogDescription": "Default function parameters allow named parameters to be initialized with default values if no value or undefined is passed.", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "description": "Default function parameters allow named parameters to be initialized with default values if no value or undefined is passed.", "ogTitle": "Default parameters - JavaScript | MDN", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Default_parameters", "language": "en-US", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "scrapeId": "4df1219e-0a67-49a4-8987-dfb8fb64dac7", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Default_parameters", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Default_parameters", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"rotate() - CSS | MDN\"?\n\nAssistant: The rotate() CSS function defines a transformation that rotates an element around a fixed point on the 2D plane, without deforming it.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Introduction\nThe **`rotate()`** CSS function defines a transformation that rotates an element around a fixed point on the 2D plane, without deforming it. Its result is a [`<transform-function>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-function) data type.\n\n## Syntax\nThe amount of rotation created by `rotate()` is specified by an [`<angle>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/angle). If positive, the movement will be clockwise; if negative, it will be counter-clockwise. A rotation by 180° is called _point_ _reflection_.\n\n```\nrotate(a)\n```\n\n## Values\n[_a_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-function/rotate#a)\n\nIs an [`<angle>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/angle) representing the angle of the rotation. The direction of rotation depends on the writing direction. In a left-to-right context, a positive angle denotes a clockwise rotation, a negative angle a counter-clockwise one. In a right-to-left context, a positive angle denotes a counter-clockwise rotation, a negative angle a clockwise one.\n\n## Formal syntax\n```\n<rotate()> =\n  rotate( [ <angle> | <zero> ] )\n```\n\n## Examples\n### Basic example\n#### HTML\n```\n<div>Normal</div>\n<div class=\"rotated\">Rotated</div>\n```\n#### CSS\n```\ndiv {\n  width: 80px;\n  height: 80px;\n  background-color: skyblue;\n}\n\n.rotated {\n  transform: rotate(45deg); /* Equal to rotateZ(45deg) */\n  background-color: pink;\n}\n```\n\n## Combining rotation with another transformation\nIf you want to apply multiple transformations to an element, be careful about the order in which you specify your transformations. For example, if you rotate before translating, the translation will be along the new axis of rotation!\n\n#### HTML\n```\n<div>Normal</div>\n<div class=\"rotate\">Rotated</div>\n<div class=\"rotate-translate\">Rotated + Translated</div>\n<div class=\"translate-rotate\">Translated + Rotated</div>\n```\n#### CSS\n```\ndiv {\n  position: absolute;\n  left: 40px;\n  top: 40px;\n  width: 100px;\n  height: 100px;\n  background-color: lightgray;\n}\n\n.rotate {\n  background-color: transparent;\n  outline: 2px dashed;\n  transform: rotate(45deg);\n}\n\n.rotate-translate {\n  background-color: pink;\n  transform: rotate(45deg) translateX(180px);\n}\n\n.translate-rotate {\n  background-color: gold;\n  transform: translateX(180px) rotate(45deg);\n}\n```\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [CSS Transforms Module Level 1](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-transforms/#funcdef-transform-rotate) |\n\n## Browser compatibility\n|  | desktop | mobile |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Chrome | Edge | Firefox | Opera | Safari | Chrome Android | Firefox for Android | Opera Android | Safari on iOS | Samsung Internet | WebView Android | WebView on iOS |\n| `rotate()` | Chrome – Full support<br>Chrome1<br>Toggle history | Edge – Full support<br>Edge12<br>Toggle history | Firefox – Full support<br>Firefox3.5<br>Toggle history | Opera – Full support<br>Opera10.5<br>Toggle history | Safari – Full support<br>Safari3.1<br>Toggle history | Chrome Android – Full support<br>Chrome Android18<br>Toggle history | Firefox for Android – Full support<br>Firefox for Android4<br>Toggle history | Opera Android – Full support<br>Opera Android11<br>Toggle history | Safari on iOS – Full support<br>Safari on iOS3.2<br>Toggle history | Samsung Internet – Full support<br>Samsung Internet1.0<br>Toggle history | WebView Android – Full support<br>WebView Android2<br>Toggle history | WebView on iOS – Full support<br>WebView on iOS3.2<br>Toggle history |\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-function/rotate", "title": "rotate() - CSS | MDN", "description": "The rotate() CSS function defines a transformation that rotates an element around a fixed point on the 2D plane, without deforming it.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 8, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 02:28:34", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"viewport": ["width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"], "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "og:title": "rotate() - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets | MDN", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "position": ["1", "2", "3", "4"], "title": "rotate() - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets | MDN", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "description": "The rotate() CSS function defines a transformation that rotates an element around a\nfixed point on the 2D plane, without deforming it.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"<input> element of type email\"?\n\nAssistant: `<input>` elements of type `email` are used to let the user enter and edit an email address, or, if the `multiple` attribute is specified, a list of email addresses.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Try it\n```html\n<label for=\"email\">Enter your example.com email:</label>\n\n<input type=\"email\" id=\"email\" pattern=\".+@example\\.com\" size=\"30\" required />\n```\n\n```css\nlabel {\n  display: block;\n  font:\n    1rem \"Fira Sans\",\n    sans-serif;\n}\n\ninput,\nlabel {\n  margin: 0.4rem 0;\n}\n```\nThe input value is automatically validated to ensure that it's either empty or a properly-formatted email address (or list of addresses) before the form can be submitted. The `:valid` and `:invalid` CSS pseudo-classes are automatically applied as appropriate to visually denote whether the current value of the field is a valid email address or not.\n\n## Value\nThe `<input>` element's `value` attribute contains a string which is automatically validated as conforming to email syntax. More specifically, there are three possible value formats that will pass validation:\n\n1. An empty string (\"\") indicating that the user did not enter a value or that the value was removed.\n2. A single properly-formed email address. This doesn't necessarily mean the email address exists, but it is at least formatted correctly. In simple terms, this means `username@domain` or `username@domain.tld`. There's more to it than that, of course; see [Validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/email#validation) for a [regular expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Regular_expression) that matches the email address validation algorithm.\n3. If and only if the `multiple` attribute is specified, the value can be a list of properly-formed comma-separated email addresses. Any trailing and leading whitespace is removed from each address in the list.\n\nSee [Validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/email#validation) for details on how email addresses are validated to ensure that they're formatted properly.\n\n## Additional attributes\nIn addition to the global attributes, and the attributes that operate on all `<input>` elements regardless of their type, `email` inputs support the following attributes.\n\n**Note:** The `autocorrect` global attribute can be added to email inputs, but the stored state is always `off`.\n\n## Using email inputs\nEmail addresses are among the most frequently-inputted textual data forms on the web; they're used when logging into websites, when requesting information, to allow order confirmation, for webmail, and so forth. As such, the `email` input type can make your job as a web developer much easier since it can help simplify your work when building the user interface and logic for email addresses. When you create an email input with the proper `type` value, `email`, you get automatic validation that the entered text is at least in the correct form to potentially be a legitimate email address. This can help avoid cases in which the user mistypes their address, or provides an invalid address.\n\n## A basic email input\nCurrently, all browsers which implement this element implement it as a standard text input field with basic validation features. The specification does, however, allow browsers latitude on this. For example, the element could be integrated with the user's device's built-in address book to allow picking email addresses from that list. In its most basic form, an `email` input can be implemented like this:\n\n```html\n<input id=\"emailAddress\" type=\"email\" />\n```\n\nNotice that it's considered valid when empty and when a single validly-formatted email address is entered, but is otherwise not considered valid. By adding the `required` attribute, only validly-formed email addresses are allowed; the input is no longer considered valid when empty.\n\n## Allowing multiple email addresses\nBy adding the `multiple` Boolean attribute, the input can be configured to accept multiple email addresses.\n\n```html\n<input id=\"emailAddress\" type=\"email\" multiple />\n```\n\nThe input is now considered valid when a single email address is entered, or when any number of email addresses separated by commas and, optionally, some number of whitespace characters are present.\n\n## Placeholders\nSometimes it's helpful to offer an in-context hint as to what form the input data should take. This can be especially important if the page design doesn't offer descriptive labels for each `<input>`. This is where **placeholders** come in. A placeholder is a value that demonstrates the form the `value` should take by presenting an example of a valid value, which is displayed inside the edit box when the element's `value` is \"\". Once data is entered into the box, the placeholder disappears; if the box is emptied, the placeholder reappears.\n\nHere, we have an `email` input with the placeholder `sophie@example.com`. Note how the placeholder disappears and reappears as you manipulate the contents of the edit field.\n\n```html\n<input type=\"email\" placeholder=\"sophie@example.com\" />\n```\n\n## Controlling the input size\nYou can control not only the physical length of the input box, but also the minimum and maximum lengths allowed for the input text itself.\n\n## Providing default options\nYou can provide a default value for an `email` input box by setting its `value` attribute:\n\n```html\n<input type=\"email\" value=\"default@example.com\" />\n```\n\nTaking it a step further, you can provide a list of default options from which the user can select by specifying the `list` attribute.\n\n## Validation\nThere are two levels of content validation available for `email` inputs. First, there's the standard level of validation offered to all `<input>` s, which automatically ensures that the contents meet the requirements to be a valid email address.\n\n## Basic validation\nBrowsers automatically provide validation to ensure that only text that matches the standard format for Internet email addresses is entered into the input box.\n\n## Pattern validation\nIf you need the entered email address to be restricted further than just \"any string that looks like an email address,\" you can use the `pattern` attribute to specify a regular expression the value must match for it to be valid.\n\n## Examples\nHere we have an email input with the ID `emailAddress` which is allowed to be up to a maximum of 256 characters long. The input box itself is physically 64 characters wide, and displays the text `user@example.gov` as a placeholder anytime the field is empty.\n\n## Technical summary\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **[Value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/email#value)** | A string representing an email address, or<br> empty |\n| **Events** | [`change`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/change_event \"change\") and<br> [`input`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/input_event \"input\") |\n| **Supported Common Attributes** | [`autocomplete`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#autocomplete),<br> [`list`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#list),<br> [`maxlength`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#maxlength),<br> [`minlength`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#minlength),<br> [`multiple`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#multiple),<br> [`name`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#name),<br> [`pattern`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#pattern),<br> [`placeholder`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#placeholder),<br> [`readonly`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#readonly),<br> [`required`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#required),<br> [`size`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#size), and<br> [`type`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#type) |\n| **IDL attributes** | `list` and `value` |\n| **DOM interface** | [`HTMLInputElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement) |\n| **Methods** | [`select()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement/select \"select()\") |\n| **Implicit ARIA Role** | with no `list` attribute:<br> `textbox`<br> with `list` attribute: `combobox` |\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/email", "title": "<input> element of type email", "description": "`<input>` elements of type `email` are used to let the user enter and edit an email address, or, if the `multiple` attribute is specified, a list of email addresses.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 14, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 02:29:11", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "og:type": "website", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "position": ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"], "ogLocale": "en_US", "ogDescription": "<input> elements of type email are used to let the user enter and edit an email address, or, if the multiple attribute is specified, a list of email addresses.", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/email", "og:description": "<input> elements of type email are used to let the user enter and edit an email address, or, if the multiple attribute is specified, a list of email addresses.", "og:image:height": "1080", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/email", "title": "<input type=\"email\"> - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN", "og:image:width": "1920", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "og:title": "<input type=\"email\"> - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN", "language": "en-US", "ogTitle": "<input type=\"email\"> - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "description": "<input> elements of type email are used to let the user enter and edit an email address, or, if the multiple attribute is specified, a list of email addresses.", "og:locale": "en_US", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "viewport": ["width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"], "og:image:type": "image/png", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "scrapeId": "8269de1a-5727-4c2c-b153-73308efd7b9b", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/email", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/email", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"throw\"?\n\nAssistant: The `throw` statement throws a user-defined exception. Execution of the current function will stop (the statements after `throw` won't be executed), and control will be passed to the first `catch` block in the call stack. If no `catch` block exists among caller functions, the program will terminate.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Try it\n```javascript\nfunction getRectArea(width, height) {\n  if (isNaN(width) || isNaN(height)) {\n    throw new Error(\"Parameter is not a number!\");\n  }\n}\n\ntry {\n  getRectArea(3, \"A\");\n} catch (e) {\n  console.error(e);\n  // Expected output: Error: Parameter is not a number!\n}\n```\n\n## Syntax\n```javascript\nthrow expression;\n```\n\n`expression`\n\nThe expression to throw.\n\n## Description\nThe `throw` statement is valid in all contexts where statements can be used. Its execution generates an exception that penetrates through the call stack. For more information on error bubbling and handling, see [Control flow and error handling](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Control_flow_and_error_handling).\n\nThe `throw` keyword can be followed by any kind of expression, for example:\n\n```javascript\nthrow error; // Throws a previously defined value (e.g. within a catch block)\nthrow new Error(\"Required\"); // Throws a new Error object\n```\n\nIn practice, the exception you throw should _always_ be an [`Error`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error) object or an instance of an `Error` subclass, such as [`RangeError`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RangeError). This is because code that catches the error may expect certain properties, such as [`message`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/message), to be present on the caught value. For example, web APIs typically throw [`DOMException`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMException) instances, which inherit from `Error.prototype`.\n\n## Automatic semicolon insertion\nThe syntax forbids line terminators between the `throw` keyword and the expression to be thrown.\n\n```javascript\nthrow\nnew Error();\n```\n\nThe code above is transformed by [automatic semicolon insertion (ASI)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#automatic_semicolon_insertion) into:\n\n```javascript\nthrow;\nnew Error();\n```\n\nThis is invalid code, because unlike [`return`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/return), `throw` must be followed by an expression.\n\nTo avoid this problem (to prevent ASI), you could use parentheses:\n\n```javascript\nthrow (\n  new Error()\n);\n```\n\n## Examples\n### Throwing a user-defined error\nThis example defines a function that throws a [`TypeError`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypeError) if the input is not of the expected type.\n\n```javascript\nfunction isNumeric(x) {\n  return [\"number\", \"bigint\"].includes(typeof x);\n}\n\nfunction sum(...values) {\n  if (!values.every(isNumeric)) {\n    throw new TypeError(\"Can only add numbers\");\n  }\n  return values.reduce((a, b) => a + b);\n}\n\nconsole.log(sum(1, 2, 3)); // 6\ntry {\n  sum(\"1\", \"2\");\n} catch (e) {\n  console.error(e); // TypeError: Can only add numbers\n}\n```\n\n### Throwing an existing object\nThis example calls a callback-based async function, and throws an error if the callback receives an error.\n\n```javascript\nreadFile(\"foo.txt\", (err, data) => {\n  if (err) {\n    throw err;\n  }\n  console.log(data);\n});\n\n```\n\nErrors thrown this way are not catchable by the caller and will cause the program to crash unless (a) the `readFile` function itself catches the error, or (b) the program is running in a context that catches top-level errors.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Error\"?\n\nAssistant: `Error` objects are thrown when runtime errors occur. The `Error` object can also be used as a base object for user-defined exceptions. See below for standard built-in error types.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Description\nRuntime errors result in new `Error` objects being created and thrown.\n\n`Error` is a [serializable object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Serializable_object), so it can be cloned with [`structuredClone()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/structuredClone \"structuredClone()\") or copied between [Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker) using [`postMessage()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker/postMessage \"postMessage()\").\n\n## Error types\nBesides the generic `Error` constructor, there are other core error constructors in JavaScript. For client-side exceptions, see [Exception handling statements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Control_flow_and_error_handling#exception_handling_statements).\n\n[`EvalError`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/EvalError)\n\nCreates an instance representing an error that occurs regarding the global function [`eval()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval).\n\n[`RangeError`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RangeError)\n\nCreates an instance representing an error that occurs when a numeric variable or parameter is outside its valid range.\n\n[`ReferenceError`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ReferenceError)\n\nCreates an instance representing an error that occurs when de-referencing an invalid reference.\n\n[`SyntaxError`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SyntaxError)\n\nCreates an instance representing a syntax error.\n\n[`TypeError`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypeError)\n\nCreates an instance representing an error that occurs when a variable or parameter is not of a valid type.\n\n[`URIError`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/URIError)\n\nCreates an instance representing an error that occurs when [`encodeURI()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURI) or [`decodeURI()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/decodeURI) are passed invalid parameters.\n\n[`AggregateError`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/AggregateError)\n\nCreates an instance representing several errors wrapped in a single error when multiple errors need to be reported by an operation, for example by [`Promise.any()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/any).\n\n[`InternalError`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/InternalError)Non-standard\n\nCreates an instance representing an error that occurs when an internal error in the JavaScript engine is thrown. E.g. \"too much recursion\".\n\n## Constructor\n[`Error()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/Error)\n\nCreates a new `Error` object.\n\n## Static properties\n[`Error.stackTraceLimit`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/stackTraceLimit)Non-standard\n\nA non-standard numerical property that limits how many stack frames to include in an error stack trace.\n\n## Static methods\n[`Error.captureStackTrace()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/captureStackTrace)Non-standard\n\nA non-standard function that creates the [`stack`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/stack) property on the provided object.\n\n[`Error.isError()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/isError)\n\nReturns `true` if the argument is an error, or `false` otherwise.\n\n[`Error.prepareStackTrace()`Non-standardOptional](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error#error.preparestacktrace)\n\nA non-standard function that, if provided by user code, is called by the JavaScript engine for thrown exceptions, allowing the user to provide custom formatting for stack traces. See the [V8 Stack Trace API](https://v8.dev/docs/stack-trace-api#customizing-stack-traces) docs.\n\n## Instance properties\nThese properties are defined on `Error.prototype` and shared by all `Error` instances.\n\n[`Error.prototype.constructor`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/constructor)\n\nThe constructor function that created the instance object. For `Error` instances, the initial value is the [`Error`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/Error) constructor.\n\n[`Error.prototype.name`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/name)\n\nRepresents the name for the type of error. For `Error.prototype.name`, the initial value is \"Error\". Subclasses like [`TypeError`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypeError) and [`SyntaxError`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SyntaxError) provide their own `name` properties.\n\n[`Error.prototype.stack`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/stack)Non-standard\n\nA non-standard property for a stack trace.\n\nThese properties are own properties of each `Error` instance.\n\n[`cause`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/cause)\n\nError cause indicating the reason why the current error is thrown — usually another caught error. For user-created `Error` objects, this is the value provided as the `cause` property of the constructor's second argument.\n\n[`columnNumber`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/columnNumber)Non-standard\n\nA non-standard Mozilla property for the column number in the line that raised this error.\n\n[`fileName`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/fileName)Non-standard\n\nA non-standard Mozilla property for the path to the file that raised this error.\n\n[`lineNumber`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/lineNumber)Non-standard\n\nA non-standard Mozilla property for the line number in the file that raised this error.\n\n[`message`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/message)\n\nError message. For user-created `Error` objects, this is the string provided as the constructor's first argument.\n\n## Instance methods\n[`Error.prototype.toString()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/toString)\n\nReturns a string representing the specified object. Overrides the [`Object.prototype.toString()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/toString) method.\n\n## Examples\n### [Throwing a generic error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error#throwing_a_generic_error)\nUsually you create an `Error` object with the intention of raising it using the [`throw`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/throw) keyword.\nYou can handle the error using the [`try...catch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch) construct:\n\n```js\ntry {\n  throw new Error(\"Whoops!\");\n} catch (e) {\n  console.error(`${e.name}: ${e.message}`);\n}\n```\n\n### [Handling a specific error type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error#handling_a_specific_error_type)\nYou can choose to handle only specific error types by testing the error type with the [`instanceof`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/instanceof) keyword:\n\n```js\ntry {\n  foo.bar();\n} catch (e) {\n  if (e instanceof EvalError) {\n    console.error(`${e.name}: ${e.message}`);\n  } else if (e instanceof RangeError) {\n    console.error(`${e.name}: ${e.message}`);\n  }\n  // etc.\n  else {\n    // If none of our cases matched leave the Error unhandled\n    throw e;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### [Differentiate between similar errors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error#differentiate_between_similar_errors)\nSometimes a block of code can fail for reasons that require different handling, but which throw very similar errors (i.e. with the same type and message).\n\nIf you don't have control over the original errors that are thrown, one option is to catch them and throw new `Error` objects that have more specific messages.\nThe original error should be passed to the new `Error` in the constructor's [`options`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/Error#options) parameter as its `cause` property. This ensures that the original error and stack trace are available to higher-level try/catch blocks.\n\nThe example below shows this for two methods that would otherwise fail with similar errors ( `doFailSomeWay()` and `doFailAnotherWay()`):\n\n```js\nfunction doWork() {\n  try {\n    doFailSomeWay();\n  } catch (err) {\n    throw new Error(\"Failed in some way\", { cause: err });\n  }\n  try {\n    doFailAnotherWay();\n  } catch (err) {\n    throw new Error(\"Failed in another way\", { cause: err });\n  }\n}\n\ntry {\n  doWork();\n} catch (err) {\n  switch (err.message) {\n    case \"Failed in some way\":\n      handleFailSomeWay(err.cause);\n      break;\n    case \"Failed in another way\":\n      handleFailAnotherWay(err.cause);\n      break;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Note:**\nIf you are making a library, you should prefer to use error cause to discriminate between different errors emitted — rather than asking your consumers to parse the error message. See the [error cause page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/cause#providing_structured_data_as_the_error_cause) for an example.\n\n[Custom error types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error#custom_error_types) can also use the `cause` property, provided the subclasses' constructor passes the `options` parameter when calling `super()`. The `Error()` base class constructor will read `options.cause` and define the `cause` property on the new error instance.\n\n```js\nclass MyError extends Error {\n  constructor(message, options) {\n    // Need to pass `options` as the second parameter to install the \"cause\" property.\n    super(message, options);\n  }\n}\n\nconsole.log(new MyError(\"test\", { cause: new Error(\"cause\") }).cause);\n// Error: cause\n```\n\n### [Custom error types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error#custom_error_types)\nYou might want to define your own error types deriving from `Error` to be able to `throw new MyError()` and use `instanceof MyError` to check the kind of error in the exception handler. This results in cleaner and more consistent error handling code.\n\nSee [\"What's a good way to extend Error in JavaScript?\"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1382107/whats-a-good-way-to-extend-error-in-javascript) on Stack Overflow for an in-depth discussion.\n\n**Warning:**\nBuiltin subclassing cannot be reliably transpiled to pre-ES6 code, because there's no way to construct the base class with a particular `new.target` without [`Reflect.construct()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Reflect/construct). You need [additional configuration](https://github.com/loganfsmyth/babel-plugin-transform-builtin-extend) or manually call [`Object.setPrototypeOf(this, CustomError.prototype)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/setPrototypeOf) at the end of the constructor; otherwise, the constructed instance will not be a `CustomError` instance. See the TypeScript FAQ (https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/FAQ#why-doesnt-extending-built-ins-like-error-array-and-map-work) for more information.\n\n**Note:**\nSome browsers include the `CustomError` constructor in the stack trace when using ES2015 classes.\n\n```js\nclass CustomError extends Error {\n  constructor(foo = \"bar\", ...params) {\n    // Pass remaining arguments (including vendor specific ones) to parent constructor\n    super(...params);\n\n    // Maintains proper stack trace for where our error was thrown (non-standard)\n    if (Error.captureStackTrace) {\n      Error.captureStackTrace(this, CustomError);\n    }\n\n    this.name = \"CustomError\";\n    // Custom debugging information\n    this.foo = foo;\n    this.date = new Date();\n  }\n}\n\ntry {\n  throw new CustomError(\"baz\", \"bazMessage\");\n} catch (e) {\n  console.error(e.name); // CustomError\n  console.error(e.foo); // baz\n  console.error(e.message); // bazMessage\n  console.error(e.stack); // stack trace\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error", "title": "Error", "description": "`Error` objects are thrown when runtime errors occur.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"<input> element (search)\"?\n\nAssistant: `<input>` elements of type `search` are text fields designed for the user to enter search queries into. These are functionally identical to `text` inputs, but may be styled differently by the user agent.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Try it\n```html\n<label for=\"site-search\">Search the site:</label>\n<input type=\"search\" id=\"site-search\" name=\"q\" />\n\n<button>Search</button>\n``` \n```css\nlabel {\n  display: block;\n  font:\n    1rem \"Fira Sans\",\n    sans-serif;\n}\n\ninput,\nlabel {\n  margin: 0.4rem 0;\n}\n```\n\n## Value\nThe `value` attribute contains a string representing the value contained in the search field. You can retrieve this using the `HTMLInputElement.value` property in JavaScript.\n\n```javascript\nsearchTerms = mySearch.value;\n```\nIf no validation constraints are in place for the input, the value can be any text string or an empty string ( \"\" ).\n\n## Additional attributes\nIn addition to the global attributes and the attributes that operate on all `<input>` elements regardless of their type, search field inputs support the following attributes:\n\n### list\nThe values of the list attribute is the `id` of a `<datalist>` element located in the same document. The `<datalist>` provides a list of predefined values to suggest to the user for this input.\n\n### maxlength\nThe maximum string length that the user can enter into the search field.\n\n### minlength\nThe minimum string length that the user can enter into the search field.\n\n### pattern\nThe `pattern` attribute, when specified, is a regular expression that the input's `value` must match for the value to pass constraint validation.\n\n### placeholder\nThe `placeholder` attribute is a string that provides a brief hint to the user as to what kind of information is expected in the field.\n\n### readonly\nA Boolean attribute which, if present, means this field cannot be edited by the user.\n\n### size\nThe `size` attribute is a numeric value indicating how many characters wide the input field should be.\n\n### spellcheck\n`spellcheck` is a global attribute that is used to indicate whether to enable spell-checking for an element.\n\n## Using search inputs\n`<input>` elements of type `search` are very similar to those of type `text`, except that they are specifically intended for handling search terms. They are basically equivalent in behavior, but user agents may choose to style them differently by default.\n\n## Differences between search and text types\nThe main basic differences come in the way browsers handle them. Some browsers show a cross icon that can be clicked on to remove the search term instantly.\n\n## Search form labels and accessibility\nA common design practice is not to provide a label for the search field, which could cause confusion for screen reader users. One way around this is to use WAI-ARIA features.\n\n## Validation\n`<input>` elements of type `search` have the same validation features available to them as regular `text` inputs.\n\n## A note on styling\nThere are useful pseudo-classes available for styling valid/invalid form elements.\n\n## Making input required\nYou can use the `required` attribute as an easy way of making entering a value required before form submission is allowed.\n\n## Input value length\nYou can specify a minimum length, in characters, for the entered value using the `minlength` attribute; similarly, use `maxlength` to set the maximum length of the entered value.\n\n## Specifying a pattern\nYou can use the `pattern` attribute to specify a regular expression that the inputted value must follow to be considered valid.\n\n## Technical summary\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Value** | A string representing the value contained in the search field. |\n| **Events** | `change` and `input` |\n| **Supported Common Attributes** | `autocomplete`, `list`, `maxlength`, `minlength`, `pattern`, `placeholder`, `required`, `size`. |\n| **IDL attributes** | `value` |\n| **DOM interface** | `HTMLInputElement` |\n| **Methods** | `select()`, `setRangeText()`, `setSelectionRange()`. |\n| **Implicit ARIA Role** | with no `list` attribute: `searchbox` | with `list` attribute: `combobox` |\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/search", "title": "<input> element (search)", "description": "`<input>` elements of type `search` are text fields designed for the user to enter search queries into.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"eval()\"?\n\nAssistant: The eval() function evaluates JavaScript code represented as a string and returns its completion value. The source is parsed as a script.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Warning\nExecuting JavaScript from a string is an enormous security risk. It is far too easy for a bad actor to run arbitrary code when you use eval(). See Never use direct eval()! below.\n\n## Description\neval() is a function property of the global object. The argument of the eval() function is a string. It will evaluate the source string as a script body, which means both statements and expressions are allowed. It returns the completion value of the code. For expressions, it's the value the expression evaluates to. Many statements and declarations have completion values as well, but the result may be surprising (for example, the completion value of an assignment is the assigned value, but the completion value of let is undefined), so it's recommended to not rely on statements' completion values.\n\n## Syntax\neval(script) \n\n\n\n## Parameters\nscript: A string representing a JavaScript expression, statement, or sequence of statements. The expression can include variables and properties of existing objects. It will be parsed as a script, so import declarations (which can only exist in modules) are not allowed.\n\n## Return value\nThe completion value of evaluating the given code. If the completion value is empty, undefined is returned. If script is not a string primitive, eval() returns the argument unchanged.\n\n## Exceptions\nThrows any exception that occurs during evaluation of the code, including SyntaxError if script fails to be parsed as a script.\n\n## Direct and indirect eval\nThere are two modes of eval() calls: direct eval and indirect eval. Direct eval, as the name implies, refers to directly calling the global eval function with eval(...). Everything else, including invoking it via an aliased variable, via a member access or other expression, or through the optional chaining operator, is indirect.\n\n## Never use direct eval()!\nUsing direct eval() suffers from multiple problems: eval() executes the code it's passed with the privileges of the caller. If you run eval() with a string that could be affected by a malicious party, you may end up running malicious code on the user's machine with the permissions of your webpage / extension. More importantly, allowing third-party code to access the scope in which eval() was invoked (if it's a direct eval) can lead to possible attacks that reads or changes local variables.\n\n## Using indirect eval()\nConsider this code: function looseJsonParse(obj) { return eval(`(${obj})`); } console.log(looseJsonParse(\"{ a: 4 - 1, b: function () {}, c: new Map() }\")); Simply using indirect eval and forcing strict mode can make the code much better: function looseJsonParse(obj) { return eval?.(`\"use strict\";(${obj})`); } console.log(looseJsonParse(\"{ a: 4 - 1, b: function () {}, c: new Map() }\"));\n\n## Using the Function() constructor\nThe Function() constructor is very similar to the indirect eval example above: it also evaluates the JavaScript source passed to it in the global scope without reading or mutating any local bindings, and therefore allows engines to do more optimizations than direct eval().\n\n## Using bracket accessors\nYou should not use eval() to access properties dynamically. Consider the following example where the property of the object to be accessed is not known until the code is executed. This can be done with eval(): const obj = { a: 20, b: 30 }; const propName = getPropName(); // returns \"a\" or \"b\" const result = eval(`obj.${propName}`); However, eval() is not necessary here — in fact, it's more error-prone, because if propName is not a valid identifier, it leads to a syntax error.\n\n## Using callbacks\nJavaScript has first-class functions, which means you can pass functions as arguments to other APIs, store them in variables and objects' properties, and so on.\n\n## Using JSON\nIf the string you're calling eval() on contains data (for example, an array: \"[1, 2, 3]\"), as opposed to code, you should consider switching to JSON, which allows the string to use a subset of JavaScript syntax to represent data.\n\n## Examples\nIn the following code, both of the statements containing eval() return 42. The first evaluates the string \"x + y + 1\"; the second evaluates the string \"42\".\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification | | --- | --- | | [ECMAScript® 2025 Language Specification<br># sec-eval-x](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/global-object.html#sec-eval-x) |\n\n## Browser compatibility\n|  | desktop | mobile | server | | --- | --- | --- | --- | |  | Chrome | Edge | Firefox | Opera | Safari | Chrome Android | Firefox for Android | Opera Android | Safari on iOS | Samsung Internet | WebView Android | WebView on iOS | Deno | Node.js | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | eval | Chrome – Full support<br>Chrome1<br>Toggle history | Edge – Full support<br>Edge12<br>Toggle history | Firefox – Full support<br>Firefox1<br>Toggle history | Opera – Full support<br>Opera3<br>Toggle history | Safari – Full support<br>Safari1<br>Toggle history | Chrome Android – Full support<br>Chrome Android18<br>Toggle history | Firefox for Android – Full support<br>Firefox for Android4<br>Toggle history | Opera Android – Full support<br>Opera Android10.1<br>Toggle history | Safari on iOS – Full support<br>Safari on iOS1<br>Toggle history | Samsung Internet – Full support<br>Samsung Internet1.0<br>Toggle history | WebView Android – Full support<br>WebView Android4.4<br>Toggle history | WebView on iOS – Full support<br>WebView on iOS1<br>Toggle history | Deno – Full support<br>Deno1.0<br>Toggle history | Node.js – Full support<br>Node.js0.10.0<br>Toggle history |\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval", "title": "eval()", "description": "The eval() function evaluates JavaScript code represented as a string and returns its completion value.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"import\"?\n\nAssistant: The static `import` declaration is used to import read-only live bindings which are exported by another module.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Syntax\n```javascript\nimport defaultExport from \"module-name\";\nimport * as name from \"module-name\";\nimport { export1 } from \"module-name\";\nimport { export1 as alias1 } from \"module-name\";\nimport { default as alias } from \"module-name\";\nimport { export1, export2 } from \"module-name\";\nimport { export1, export2 as alias2, /* … */ } from \"module-name\";\nimport { \"string name\" as alias } from \"module-name\";\nimport defaultExport, { export1, /* … */ } from \"module-name\";\nimport defaultExport, * as name from \"module-name\";\nimport \"module-name\";\n```\n\n## Description\n`import` declarations can only be present in modules, and only at the top-level (i.e. not inside blocks, functions, etc.). If an `import` declaration is encountered in non-module contexts (for example, `<script>` tags without `type=\"module\"`, `eval`, `new Function`, which all have \"script\" or \"function body\" as parsing goals), a `SyntaxError` is thrown. To load modules in non-module contexts, use the dynamic import syntax instead.\n\nAll imported bindings cannot be in the same scope as any other declaration, including `let`, `const`, `class`, `function`, `var`, and `import` declaration.\n\n`import` declarations are designed to be syntactically rigid (for example, only string literal specifiers, only permitted at the top-level, all bindings must be identifiers), which allows modules to be statically analyzed and linked before getting evaluated. This is the key to making modules asynchronous by nature, powering features like top-level await.\n\n## Forms of import declarations\nThere are four forms of `import` declarations:\n\n- Named import: `import { export1, export2 } from \"module-name\";`\n- Default import: `import defaultExport from \"module-name\";`\n- Namespace import: `import * as name from \"module-name\";`\n- Side effect import: `import \"module-name\";`\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import", "title": "import", "description": "The static `import` declaration is used to import read-only live bindings which are exported by another module.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 3, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 02:37:19", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import", "og:image:height": "1080", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:type": "website", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "og:image:width": "1920", "ogLocale": "en_US", "ogTitle": "import - JavaScript | MDN", "position": ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"], "og:image:type": "image/png", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "ogDescription": "The static import declaration is used to import read-only live bindings which are exported by another module.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"At-rule\"?\n\nAssistant: At-rules are CSS statements that instruct CSS how to behave. They begin with an at-sign, `@`, followed by an identifier. They include everything from the at-keyword up to the next semicolon, or the next CSS block, whichever comes first.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Syntax\nThe at-rule is defined in the CSS syntax module, with different at-rules being defined in their respective modules. They generally take one of two forms depending on the specific rule and its purpose: statement at-rules and block at-rules, which can contain nested qualified rules, at-rules, or declarations.\n\n## Statement at-rules\nStatement at-rules end in a semicolon. There are several statement at-rules, designated by their identifiers, each with a different syntax:\n\n`@charset \"utf-8\";` - Tells browser to use UTF-8 character set.\n\n`@import` - Tells the CSS engine to include an external style sheet.\n\n`@layer` - Defines the order of precedence in case of multiple cascade layers.\n\n`@namespace` - Defines a default namespace for a style sheet.\n\n## Block at-rules\nBlock at-rules end in a `{}`-block that contain nested rules, other at-rules, or property or descriptor declarations.\n\n`@counter-style` - Define custom counter styles.\n\n`@container` - A conditional group rule that applies its content if the container meets the conditions.\n\n`@font-face` - Defines font resource locations and style characteristics.\n\n`@keyframes` - Define a named animation by describing CSS styles for intermediate steps.\n\n## Index\nList of at-rules:\n- `@charset`\n- `@color-profile`\n- `@container`\n- `@counter-style`\n- `@font-face`\n- `@font-feature-values`\n- `@import`\n- `@keyframes`\n- `@layer`\n- `@media`\n- `@namespace`\n- `@page`\n- `@position-try`\n- `@property`\n- `@scope`\n- `@starting-style`\n- `@supports`\n- `@view-transition`.\n\n## Specifications\nSpecification: CSS Syntax Module Level 3.\n\n## See also\nRelated topics:\n- CSS at-rule functions\n- Nesting CSS at-rules\n- CSS statements\n- CSSRule interface\n- CSS conditional rules module\n- CSS syntax\n- Specificity\n- Inheritance.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_syntax/At-rule", "title": "At-rule", "description": "At-rules are CSS statements that instruct CSS how to behave.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"async function\"?\n\nAssistant: The `async function` declaration creates a binding of a new async function to a given name. The `await` keyword is permitted within the function body, enabling asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style and avoiding the need to explicitly configure promise chains.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Try it\n```javascript\nfunction resolveAfter2Seconds() {\n  return new Promise((resolve) => {\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      resolve(\"resolved\");\n    }, 2000);\n  });\n}\n\nasync function asyncCall() {\n  console.log(\"calling\");\n  const result = await resolveAfter2Seconds();\n  console.log(result);\n  // Expected output: \"resolved\"\n}\n\nasyncCall();\n```\n\n## Syntax\n```javascript\nasync function name(param0) {\n  statements\n}\nasync function name(param0, param1) {\n  statements\n}\nasync function name(param0, param1, /* …, */ paramN) {\n  statements\n}\n```\n\n## Parameters\n[`name`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function#name)\n\nThe function's name.\n\n[`param` Optional](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function#param)\n\nThe name of a formal parameter for the function. For the parameters' syntax, see the [Functions reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions#function_parameters).\n\n[`statements` Optional](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function#statements)\n\nThe statements comprising the body of the function. The `await` mechanism may be used.\n\n## Description\nAn `async function` declaration creates an [`AsyncFunction`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/AsyncFunction) object. Each time when an async function is called, it returns a new [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) which will be resolved with the value returned by the async function, or rejected with an exception uncaught within the async function.\n\nAsync functions can contain zero or more [`await`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await) expressions. Await expressions make promise-returning functions behave as though they're synchronous by suspending execution until the returned promise is fulfilled or rejected. The resolved value of the promise is treated as the return value of the await expression. Use of `async` and `await` enables the use of ordinary `try` / `catch` blocks around asynchronous code.\n\n**Note:**\nThe `await` keyword is only valid inside async functions within regular JavaScript code. If you use it outside of an async function's body, you will get a [`SyntaxError`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SyntaxError).\n\n## Examples\n### Async functions and execution order\n```javascript\nfunction resolveAfter2Seconds() {\n  console.log(\"starting slow promise\");\n  return new Promise((resolve) => {\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      resolve(\"slow\");\n      console.log(\"slow promise is done\");\n    }, 2000);\n  });\n}\n\nfunction resolveAfter1Second() {\n  console.log(\"starting fast promise\");\n  return new Promise((resolve) => {\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      resolve(\"fast\");\n      console.log(\"fast promise is done\");\n    }, 1000);\n  });\n}\n\nasync function sequentialStart() {\n  console.log(\"== sequentialStart starts ==\");\n\n  // 1. Start a timer, log after it's done\n  const slow = resolveAfter2Seconds();\n  console.log(await slow);\n\n  // 2. Start the next timer after waiting for the previous one\n  const fast = resolveAfter1Second();\n  console.log(await fast);\n\n  console.log(\"== sequentialStart done ==\");\n}\n\nasync function sequentialWait() {\n  console.log(\"== sequentialWait starts ==\");\n\n  // 1. Start two timers without waiting for each other\n  const slow = resolveAfter2Seconds();\n  const fast = resolveAfter1Second();\n\n  // 2. Wait for the slow timer to complete, and then log the result\n  console.log(await slow);\n  // 3. Wait for the fast timer to complete, and then log the result\n  console.log(await fast);\n\n  console.log(\"== sequentialWait done ==\");\n}\n\nasync function concurrent1() {\n  console.log(\"== concurrent1 starts ==\");\n\n  // 1. Start two timers concurrently and wait for both to complete\n  const results = await Promise.all([\n    resolveAfter2Seconds(),\n    resolveAfter1Second(),\n  ]);\n  // 2.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"<input> element (date)\"?\n\nAssistant: The `<input>` elements of type=\"date\" create input fields that let the user enter a date. The appearance of the date picker input UI varies based on the browser and operating system. The value is normalized to the format `yyyy-mm-dd`.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Try it\n```html\n<label for=\"start\">Start date:</label>\n\n<input\ntype=\"date\"\nid=\"start\"\nname=\"trip-start\"\nvalue=\"2018-07-22\"\nmin=\"2018-01-01\"\nmax=\"2018-12-31\" />\n```\n```css\nlabel {\n  display: block;\n  font:\n    1rem \"Fira Sans\",\n    sans-serif;\n}\n\ninput,\nlabel {\n  margin: 0.4rem 0;\n}\n```\n\n## Value\nA string representing the date entered in the input. The date is formatted according to [Date strings format](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Date_and_time_formats#date_strings).\n\nYou can set a default value for the input with a date inside the [`value`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#value) attribute, like so:\n\n```html\n<input type=\"date\" value=\"2017-06-01\" />\n```\n\n**Note:** The displayed date format will differ from the actual `value` — the displayed date is formatted _based on the locale of the user's browser_, but the parsed `value` is always formatted `yyyy-mm-dd`.\n\nYou can get and set the date value in JavaScript with the [`HTMLInputElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement) `value` and `valueAsNumber` properties. For example:\n\n```javascript\nconst dateControl = document.querySelector('input[type=\"date\"]');\ndateControl.value = \"2017-06-01\";\nconsole.log(dateControl.value); // prints \"2017-06-01\"\nconsole.log(dateControl.valueAsNumber); // prints 1496275200000, a JavaScript timestamp (ms)\n```\n\n## Additional attributes\nThe attributes common to all [`<input>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) elements apply to the `date` inputs as well, but might not influence its presentation. For example `size` and `placeholder` might not work. `date` inputs have the following additional attributes.\n\n### max\nThe latest date to accept. If the [`value`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#value) entered into the element occurs afterward, the element fails [constraint validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Constraint_validation). If the value of the `max` attribute isn't a possible date string in the format `yyyy-mm-dd`, then the element has no maximum date value.\n\nIf both the `max` and `min` attributes are set, this value must be a date string **later than or equal to** the one in the `min` attribute.\n\n### min\nThe earliest date to accept. If the [`value`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#value) entered into the element occurs beforehand, the element fails [constraint validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Constraint_validation). If the value of the `min` attribute isn't a possible date string in the format `yyyy-mm-dd`, then the element has no minimum date value.\n\nIf both the `max` and `min` attributes are set, this value must be a date string **earlier than or equal to** the one in the `max` attribute.\n\n### step\nThe `step` attribute is a number that specifies the granularity that the value must adhere to, or the special value `any`, which is described below. Only values which are equal to the basis for stepping ( [`min`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/date#min) if specified, [`value`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#value) otherwise, and an appropriate default value if neither of those is provided) are valid.\n\nA string value of `any` means that no stepping is implied, and any value is allowed (barring other constraints, such as [`min`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/date#min) and [`max`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/date#max)).\n\n**Note:** When the data entered by the user doesn't adhere to the stepping configuration, the [user agent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent) may round to the nearest valid value, preferring numbers in the positive direction when there are two equally close options.\n\nFor `date` inputs, the value of `step` is given in days; and is treated as a number of milliseconds equal to 86,400,000 times the `step` value (the underlying numeric value is in milliseconds). The default value of `step` is 1, indicating 1 day.\n\n**Note:** Specifying `any` as the value for `step` has the same effect as `1` for `date` inputs.\n\n## Using date inputs\nDate inputs provide an easy interface for choosing dates, and they normalize the data format sent to the server regardless of the user's locale.\n\nIn this section, we'll look at basic and then more complex uses of `<input type=\"date\">`.\n\n### Basic uses of date\nThe most basic use of `<input type=\"date\">` involves one `<input>` combined with its [`<label>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label), as seen below:\n\n```html\n<form action=\"https://example.com\">\n  <label>\n    Enter your birthday:\n    <input type=\"date\" name=\"bday\" />\n  </label>\n\n  <p><button>Submit</button></p>\n</form>\n```\n\nThis HTML submits the entered date under the key `bday` to `https://example.com` — resulting in a URL like `https://example.com/?bday=1955-06-08`.\n\n### Setting maximum and minimum dates\nYou can use the [`min`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#min) and [`max`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#max) attributes to restrict the dates that can be chosen by the user. In the following example, we set a minimum date of `2017-04-01` and a maximum date of `2017-04-30`:\n\n```html\n<form>\n  <label>\n    Choose your preferred party date:\n    <input type=\"date\" name=\"party\" min=\"2017-04-01\" max=\"2017-04-30\" />\n  </label>\n</form>\n```\n\nThe result is that only days in April 2017 can be selected — the month and year parts of the textbox will be uneditable, and dates outside April 2017 can't be selected in the picker widget.\n\nYou can use the [`step`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#step) attribute to vary the number of days jumped each time the date is incremented (e.g. to only make Saturdays selectable).\n\n## Controlling input size\n`<input type=\"date\">` doesn't support form sizing attributes such as [`size`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#size). Prefer [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) for sizing it.\n\n## Validation\nBy default, `<input type=\"date\">` doesn't validate the entered value beyond its format. The interfaces generally don't let you enter anything that isn't a date — which is helpful.\n\nIf you use [`min`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#min) and [`max`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#max) to restrict the available dates (see [Setting maximum and minimum dates](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/date#setting_maximum_and_minimum_dates)), the form control disables invalid dates, and will display an error if you try to submit a date that is out of bounds.\n\nYou can also use the [`required`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#required) attribute to make filling in the date mandatory — an error will be displayed if you try to submit an empty date field.\n\nLet's look at an example of minimum and maximum dates, and also made a field required:\n\n```html\n<form>\n  <label>\n    Choose your preferred party date (required, April 1st to 20th):\n    <input\n      type=\"date\"\n      name=\"party\"\n      min=\"2017-04-01\"\n      max=\"2017-04-20\"\n      required />\n    <span class=\"validity\"></span>\n  </label>\n\n  <p>\n    <button>Submit</button>\n  </p>\n</form>\n```\n\nIf you try to submit the form with an incomplete date (or with a date outside the set bounds), the browser displays an error. Try playing with the example now:\n\nHere's the CSS used in the above example. We make use of the [`:valid`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:valid) and [`:invalid`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:invalid) [pseudo-elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements) to add an icon next to the input, based on whether the current value is valid. We had to put the icon on a [`<span>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/span) next to the input, not on the input itself, because in Chrome at least the input's generated content is placed inside the form control, and can't be styled or shown effectively.\n\n```css\nlabel {\n  display: flex;\n  align-items: center;\n}\n\nspan::after {\n  padding-left: 5px;\n}\n\ninput:invalid + span::after {\n  content: \"✖\";\n}\n\ninput:valid + span::after {\n  content: \"✓\";\n}\n```\n\n## Examples\nIn this example, we create a date picker using the native `<input type=\"date\">` picker.\n\n### HTML\nThe HTML looks like so:\n\n```html\n<form>\n  <div class=\"nativeDatePicker\">\n    <label for=\"bday\">Enter your birthday:</label>\n    <input type=\"date\" id=\"bday\" name=\"bday\" />\n    <span class=\"validity\"></span>\n  </div>\n</form>\n```\n\n### CSS\nThe CSS looks like so:\n\n```css\ninput:invalid + span::after {\n  content: \" ✖\";\n}\n\ninput:valid + span::after {\n  content: \" ✓\";\n}\n```\n\n## Technical summary\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **[Value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/date#value)** | A string representing a date in YYYY-MM-DD<br> format, or empty |\n| **Events** | [`change`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/change_event \"change\") and<br> [`input`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/input_event \"input\") |\n| **Supported common attributes** | [`autocomplete`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#autocomplete),<br> [`list`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#list),<br> [`readonly`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#readonly),<br> [`step`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#step) |\n| **IDL attributes** | [`value`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#value),<br> `valueAsDate`,<br> `valueAsNumber` |\n| **DOM interface** | [`HTMLInputElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement) |\n| **Methods** | [`select()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement/select \"select()\"),<br> [`stepDown()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement/stepDown \"stepDown()\"),<br> [`stepUp()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement/stepUp \"stepUp()\") |\n| **Implicit ARIA Role** | [no corresponding role](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/#dfn-no-corresponding-role) |\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [HTML<br># date-state-(type=date)](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/input.html#date-state-(type=date)) |\n\n## Browser compatibility\n\n\n## See also\n- The generic [`<input>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) element and the interface used to manipulate it, [`HTMLInputElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement)\n- [Date and Time picker tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/HTML5_input_types#date_and_time_pickers)\n- [Date and time formats used in HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Date_and_time_formats)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/date", "title": "<input> element (date)", "description": "The `<input>` elements of type=\"date\" create input fields that let the user enter a date.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Array.prototype.map()\"?\n\nAssistant: The `map()` method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Description\nThe `map()` method is an iterative method. It calls a provided `callbackFn` function once for each element in an array and constructs a new array from the results. Read the iterative methods section for more information about how these methods work in general.\n\n`callbackFn` is invoked only for array indexes which have assigned values. It is not invoked for empty slots in sparse arrays.\n\nThe `map()` method is generic. It only expects the `this` value to have a `length` property and integer-keyed properties.\n\nSince `map` builds a new array, calling it without using the returned array is an anti-pattern; use `forEach` or `for...of` instead.\n\n## Syntax\nmap(callbackFn)\nmap(callbackFn, thisArg)\n\n## Parameters\n`callbackFn`\nA function to execute for each element in the array. Its return value is added as a single element in the new array. The function is called with the following arguments:\n\n`element`\nThe current element being processed in the array.\n\n`index`\nThe index of the current element being processed in the array.\n\n`array`\nThe array `map()` was called upon.\n\n`thisArg` Optional\nA value to use as `this` when executing `callbackFn`.\n\n## Return value\nA new array with each element being the result of the callback function.\n\n## Examples\n### Mapping an array of numbers to an array of square roots\nThe following code takes an array of numbers and creates a new array containing the square roots of the numbers in the first array.\n\n```javascript\nconst numbers = [1, 4, 9];\nconst roots = numbers.map((num) => Math.sqrt(num));\n\n// roots is now     [1, 2, 3]\n// numbers is still [1, 4, 9]\n```\n\n### Using map to reformat objects in an array\nThe following code takes an array of objects and creates a new array containing the newly reformatted objects.\n\n```javascript\nconst kvArray = [\n  { key: 1, value: 10 },\n  { key: 2, value: 20 },\n  { key: 3, value: 30 },\n];\n\nconst reformattedArray = kvArray.map(({ key, value }) => ({ [key]: value }));\n\nconsole.log(reformattedArray); // [{ 1: 10 }, { 2: 20 }, { 3: 30 }]\nconsole.log(kvArray);\n// [\n//   { key: 1, value: 10 },\n//   { key: 2, value: 20 },\n//   { key: 3, value: 30 }\n// ]\n```\n\n### Using parseInt() with map()\nIt is common to use the callback with one argument (the element being traversed). Certain functions are also commonly used with one argument, even though they take additional optional arguments. These habits may lead to confusing behaviors. Consider:\n\n```javascript\n[\"1\", \"2\", \"3\"].map(parseInt);\n```\n\nWhile one might expect `[1, 2, 3]`, the actual result is `[1, NaN, NaN]`.\n\n## Browser compatibility\n|  | desktop | mobile | server |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Chrome | Edge | Firefox | Opera | Safari | Chrome Android | Firefox for Android | Opera Android | Safari on iOS | Samsung Internet | WebView Android | WebView on iOS | Deno | Node.js |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `map` | Chrome – Full support<br>Chrome1<br>Toggle history | Edge – Full support<br>Edge12<br>Toggle history | Firefox – Full support<br>Firefox1.5<br>Toggle history | Opera – Full support<br>Opera9.5<br>Toggle history | Safari – Full support<br>Safari3<br>Toggle history | Chrome Android – Full support<br>Chrome Android18<br>Toggle history | Firefox for Android – Full support<br>Firefox for Android4<br>Toggle history | Opera Android – Full support<br>Opera Android10.1<br>Toggle history | Safari on iOS – Full support<br>Safari on iOS1<br>Toggle history | Samsung Internet – Full support<br>Samsung Internet1.0<br>Toggle history | WebView Android – Full support<br>WebView Android37<br>Toggle history | WebView on iOS – Full support<br>WebView on iOS1<br>Toggle history | Deno – Full support<br>Deno1.0<br>Toggle history | Node.js – Full support<br>Node.js0.10.0<br>Toggle history |\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map", "title": "Array.prototype.map()", "description": "The `map()` method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 6, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 02:46:00", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"position": ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6"], "og:image:type": "image/png", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "language": "en-US", "og:type": "website", "ogTitle": "Array.prototype.map() - JavaScript | MDN", "title": "Array.prototype.map() - JavaScript | MDN", "og:locale": "en_US", "ogDescription": "The map() method of Array instances creates\na new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on\nevery element in the calling array.", "og:description": "The map() method of Array instances creates\na new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on\nevery element in the calling array.", "og:title": "Array.prototype.map() - JavaScript | MDN", "ogLocale": "en_US", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:image:width": "1920", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map", "og:image:height": "1080", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The map() method of Array instances creates\na new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on\nevery element in the calling array.", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "scrapeId": "23d84d2f-2c24-4555-8d23-c0621830b93f", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"String.prototype.split()\"?\n\nAssistant: The split() method of String values takes a pattern and divides this string into an ordered list of substrings by searching for the pattern, puts these substrings into an array, and returns the array.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Try it\n```javascript\nconst str = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\";\n\nconst words = str.split(\" \");\nconsole.log(words[3]);\n// Expected output: \"fox\"\n\nconst chars = str.split(\"\");\nconsole.log(chars[8]);\n// Expected output: \"k\"\n\nconst strCopy = str.split();\nconsole.log(strCopy);\n// Expected output: Array [\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\"]\n```\n\n## Syntax\n```javascript\nsplit(separator)\nsplit(separator, limit)\n```\n\n## Parameters\n**separator**: The pattern describing where each split should occur. Can be `undefined`, a string, or an object with a `Symbol.split` method — the typical example being a regular expression. Omitting `separator` or passing `undefined` causes `split()` to return an array with the calling string as a single element. All values that are not `undefined` or objects with a `[Symbol.split]()` method are coerced to strings.\n\n**limit (Optional)**: A non-negative integer specifying a limit on the number of substrings to be included in the array. If provided, splits the string at each occurrence of the specified `separator`, but stops when `limit` entries have been placed in the array. Any leftover text is not included in the array at all.\n\n## Return value\nIf `separator` is a string, an `Array` of strings is returned, split at each point where the `separator` occurs in the given string.\n\nIf `separator` is a regex, the returned `Array` also contains the captured groups for each separator match; see below for details. The capturing groups may be unmatched, in which case they are `undefined` in the array.\n\nIf `separator` has a custom `[Symbol.split]()` method, its return value is directly returned.\n\n## Description\nIf `separator` is a non-empty string, the target string is split by all matches of the `separator` without including `separator` in the results. For example, a string containing tab separated values (TSV) could be parsed by passing a tab character as the separator, like `myString.split(\"\\t\")`. If `separator` contains multiple characters, that entire character sequence must be found in order to split. If `separator` appears at the beginning (or end) of the string, it still has the effect of splitting, resulting in an empty (i.e. zero length) string appearing at the first (or last) position of the returned array. If `separator` does not occur in `str`, the returned array contains one element consisting of the entire string.\n\nIf `separator` is an empty string ( `\"\"`), `str` is converted to an array of each of its UTF-16 \"characters\", without empty strings on either ends of the resulting string.\n\n## Examples\n### Using split()\nWhen the string is empty and a non-empty separator is specified, `split()` returns `['']`. If the string and separator are both empty strings, an empty array is returned.\n\n```javascript\nconst emptyString = \"\";\n\n// string is empty and separator is non-empty\nconsole.log(emptyString.split(\"a\"));\n// [\"\"]\n\n// string and separator are both empty strings\nconsole.log(emptyString.split(emptyString));\n// []\n```\n\nThe following example defines a function that splits a string into an array of strings using `separator`. After splitting the string, the function logs messages indicating the original string (before the split), the separator used, the number of elements in the array, and the individual array elements.\n\n```javascript\nfunction splitString(stringToSplit, separator) {\n  const arrayOfStrings = stringToSplit.split(separator);\n\n  console.log(\"The original string is:\", stringToSplit);\n  console.log(\"The separator is:\", separator);\n  console.log(\n    \"The array has\",\n    arrayOfStrings.length,\n    \"elements:\",\n    arrayOfStrings.join(\" / \"),\n  );\n}\n\nconst tempestString = \"Oh brave new world that has such people in it.\";\nconst monthString = \"Jan,Feb,Mar,Apr,May,Jun,Jul,Aug,Sep,Oct,Nov,Dec\";\n\nconst space = \" \";\nconst comma = \",\";\n\nsplitString(tempestString, space);\nsplitString(tempestString);\nsplitString(monthString, comma);\n```\n\n### Removing spaces from a string\nIn the following example, `split()` looks for zero or more spaces, followed by a semicolon, followed by zero or more spaces—and, when found, removes the spaces and the semicolon from the string. `nameList` is the array returned as a result of `split()`. \n\n```javascript\nconst names = \"Harry Trump ;Fred Barney; Helen Rigby ; Bill Abel ;Chris Hand \";\n\nconsole.log(names);\n\nconst re = /\\s*(?:;|$)\\s*/;\nconst nameList = names.split(re);\n\nconsole.log(nameList);\n```\n\n### Returning a limited number of splits\nIn the following example, `split()` looks for spaces in a string and returns the first 3 splits that it finds.\n\n```javascript\nconst myString = \"Hello World. How are you doing?\";\nconst splits = myString.split(\" \", 3);\n\nconsole.log(splits); // [ \"Hello\", \"World.\", \"How\" ]\n```\n\n### Splitting with a RegExp to include parts of the separator in the result\nIf `separator` is a regular expression that contains capturing parentheses `( )`, matched results are included in the array.\n\n```javascript\nconst myString = \"Hello 1 word. Sentence number 2.\";\nconst splits = myString.split(/(\\d)/);\n\nconsole.log(splits);\n// [ \"Hello \", \"1\", \" word.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Math.random()\"?\n\nAssistant: The Math.random() static method returns a floating-point, pseudo-random number that's greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1, with approximately uniform distribution over that range.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Try it\n```javascript\nfunction getRandomInt(max) {\n  return Math.floor(Math.random() * max);\n}\n\nconsole.log(getRandomInt(3));\n// Expected output: 0, 1 or 2\n\nconsole.log(getRandomInt(1));\n// Expected output: 0\n\nconsole.log(Math.random());\n// Expected output: a number from 0 to <1\n```\n\n## Syntax\n```javascript\nMath.random()\n```\n\n## Parameters\nNone.\n\n## Return value\nA floating-point, pseudo-random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).\n\n## Examples\nNote that as numbers in JavaScript are IEEE 754 floating point numbers with round-to-nearest-even behavior, the ranges claimed for the functions below (excluding the one for Math.random() itself) aren't exact. Usually, the claimed upper bound is not attainable, but if Math.random() returns a number very close to 1, the tiny difference may not be representable at the requested maximum, therefore causing the upper bound to be attained.\n\n### Getting a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive)\n```javascript\nfunction getRandom() {\n  return Math.random();\n}\n```\n\n### Getting a random number between two values\nThis example returns a random number between the specified values. The returned value is no lower than (and may possibly equal) min, and is less than (and not equal to) max.\n```javascript\nfunction getRandomArbitrary(min, max) {\n  return Math.random() * (max - min) + min;\n}\n```\n\n### Getting a random integer between two values\nThis example returns a random integer between the specified values. The value is no lower than min (or the next integer greater than min if min isn't an integer), and is less than (but not equal to) max.\n```javascript\nfunction getRandomInt(min, max) {\n  const minCeiled = Math.ceil(min);\n  const maxFloored = Math.floor(max);\n  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (maxFloored - minCeiled) + minCeiled); // The maximum is exclusive and the minimum is inclusive\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** It might be tempting to use Math.round() to accomplish that, but doing so would cause your random numbers to follow a non-uniform distribution, which may not be acceptable for your needs.\n\n### Getting a random integer between two values, inclusive\nWhile the getRandomInt() function above is inclusive at the minimum, it's exclusive at the maximum. What if you need the results to be inclusive at both the minimum and the maximum? The getRandomIntInclusive() function below accomplishes that.\n```javascript\nfunction getRandomIntInclusive(min, max) {\n  const minCeiled = Math.ceil(min);\n  const maxFloored = Math.floor(max);\n  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (maxFloored - minCeiled + 1) + minCeiled); // The maximum is inclusive and the minimum is inclusive\n}\n```\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [ECMAScript® 2025 Language Specification<br># sec-math.random](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/numbers-and-dates.html#sec-math.random) |\n\n## Browser compatibility\n|  | desktop | mobile | server |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Chrome | Edge | Firefox | Opera | Safari | Chrome Android | Firefox for Android | Opera Android | Safari on iOS | Samsung Internet | WebView Android | WebView on iOS | Deno | Node.js |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `random` | Chrome – Full support<br>Chrome1<br>Toggle history | Edge – Full support<br>Edge12<br>Toggle history | Firefox – Full support<br>Firefox1<br>Toggle history | Opera – Full support<br>Opera3<br>Toggle history | Safari – Full support<br>Safari1<br>Toggle history | Chrome Android – Full support<br>Chrome Android18<br>Toggle history | Firefox for Android – Full support<br>Firefox for Android4<br>Toggle history | Opera Android – Full support<br>Opera Android10.1<br>Toggle history | Safari on iOS – Full support<br>Safari on iOS1<br>Toggle history | Samsung Internet – Full support<br>Samsung Internet1.0<br>Toggle history | WebView Android – Full support<br>WebView Android4.4<br>Toggle history | WebView on iOS – Full support<br>WebView on iOS1<br>Toggle history | Deno – Full support<br>Deno1.0<br>Toggle history | Node.js – Full support<br>Node.js0.10.0<br>Toggle history |\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random", "title": "Math.random()", "description": "The Math.random() static method returns a floating-point, pseudo-random number that's greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1, with approximately uniform distribution over that range.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 7, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 02:49:55", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:locale": "en_US", "og:title": "Math.random() - JavaScript | MDN", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "og:description": "The Math.random() static method returns a floating-point, pseudo-random number that's greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1, with approximately uniform distribution over that range — which you can then scale to your desired range.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Object.fromEntries()\"?\n\nAssistant: The `Object.fromEntries()` static method transforms a list of key-value pairs into an object.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Description\nThe `Object.fromEntries()` method takes a list of key-value pairs and returns a new object whose properties are given by those entries. The `iterable` argument is expected to be an object that implements an `[Symbol.iterator]()` method. The method returns an iterator object that produces two-element array-like objects. The first element is a value that will be used as a property key, and the second element is the value to associate with that property key.\n\n`Object.fromEntries()` performs the reverse of [`Object.entries()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/entries), except that `Object.entries()` only returns string-keyed properties, while `Object.fromEntries()` can also create symbol-keyed properties.\n\n**Note:** Unlike [`Array.from()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/from), `Object.fromEntries()` does not use the value of `this`, so calling it on another constructor does not create objects of that type.\n\n## Syntax\n```\nObject.fromEntries(iterable)\n```\n\n## Parameters\n[`iterable`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/fromEntries#iterable)\n\nAn [iterable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#the_iterable_protocol), such as an [`Array`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) or [`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map), containing a list of objects. Each object should have two properties:\n\n[`0`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/fromEntries#0)\n\nA string or [symbol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol) representing the property key.\n\n[`1`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/fromEntries#1)\n\nThe property value.\n\nTypically, this object is implemented as a two-element array, with the first element being the property key and the second element being the property value.\n\n## Return value\nA new object whose properties are given by the entries of the iterable.\n\n## Examples\n### [Converting a Map to an Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/fromEntries#converting_a_map_to_an_object)\n\nWith `Object.fromEntries`, you can convert from [`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) to [`Object`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object):\n\n```\nconst map = new Map([\n  [\"foo\", \"bar\"],\n  [\"baz\", 42],\n]);\nconst obj = Object.fromEntries(map);\nconsole.log(obj); // { foo: \"bar\", baz: 42 }\n```\n\n### [Converting an Array to an Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/fromEntries#converting_an_array_to_an_object)\n\nWith `Object.fromEntries`, you can convert from [`Array`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) to [`Object`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object):\n\n```\nconst arr = [\n  [\"0\", \"a\"],\n  [\"1\", \"b\"],\n  [\"2\", \"c\"],\n];\nconst obj = Object.fromEntries(arr);\nconsole.log(obj);

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Array.prototype.pop()\"?\n\nAssistant: The pop() method of Array instances removes the last element from an array and returns that element. This method changes the length of the array.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Try it\n```javascript\nconst plants = [\"broccoli\", \"cauliflower\", \"cabbage\", \"kale\", \"tomato\"];\n\nconsole.log(plants.pop());\n// Expected output: \"tomato\"\n\nconsole.log(plants);\n// Expected output: Array [\"broccoli\", \"cauliflower\", \"cabbage\", \"kale\"]\n\nplants.pop();\n\nconsole.log(plants);\n// Expected output: Array [\"broccoli\", \"cauliflower\", \"cabbage\"]\n```\n\n## Syntax\n```javascript\npop()\n```\n\n## Parameters\nNone.\n\n## Return value\nThe removed element from the array; undefined if the array is empty.\n\n## Description\nThe pop() method removes the last element from an array and returns that value to the caller. If you call pop() on an empty array, it returns undefined.\n\nArray.prototype.shift() has similar behavior to pop(), but applied to the first element in an array.\n\nThe pop() method is a mutating method. It changes the length and the content of this. In case you want the value of this to be the same, but return a new array with the last element removed, you can use arr.slice(0, -1) instead.\n\nThe pop() method is generic. It only expects the this value to have a length property and integer-keyed properties. Although strings are also array-like, this method is not suitable to be applied on them, as strings are immutable.\n\n## Examples\n### Removing the last element of an array\nThe following code creates the myFish array containing four elements, then removes its last element.\n\n```javascript\nconst myFish = [\"angel\", \"clown\", \"mandarin\", \"sturgeon\"];\n\nconst popped = myFish.pop();\n\nconsole.log(myFish); // ['angel', 'clown', 'mandarin' ]\n\nconsole.log(popped); // 'sturgeon'\n```\n\n### Calling pop() on non-array objects\nThe pop() method reads the length property of this. If the normalized length is 0, length is set to 0 again (whereas it may be negative or undefined before). Otherwise, the property at length - 1 is returned and deleted.\n\n```javascript\nconst arrayLike = {\n  length: 3,\n  unrelated: \"foo\",\n  2: 4,\n};\nconsole.log(Array.prototype.pop.call(arrayLike));\n// 4\nconsole.log(arrayLike);\n// { length: 2, unrelated: 'foo' }\n\nconst plainObj = {};\n// There's no length property, so the length is 0\nArray.prototype.pop.call(plainObj);\nconsole.log(plainObj);\n// { length: 0 }\n```\n\n### Using an object in an array-like fashion\npush and pop are intentionally generic, and we can use that to our advantage — as the following example shows.\nNote that in this example, we don't create an array to store a collection of objects. Instead, we store the collection on the object itself and use call on Array.prototype.push and Array.prototype.pop to trick those methods into thinking we're dealing with an array.\n\n```javascript\nconst collection = {\n  length: 0,\n  addElements(...elements) {\n    // obj.length will be incremented automatically\n    // every time an element is added.\n\n    // Returning what push returns; that is\n    // the new value of length property.\n    return [].push.call(this, ...elements);\n  },\n  removeElement() {\n    // obj.length will be decremented automatically\n    // every time an element is removed.\n\n    // Returning what pop returns; that is\n    // the removed element.\n    return [].pop.call(this);\n  },\n};\n\ncollection.addElements(10, 20, 30);\nconsole.log(collection.length); // 3\ncollection.removeElement();\nconsole.log(collection.length); // 2\n```\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [ECMAScript® 2025 Language Specification<br># sec-array.prototype.pop](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/indexed-collections.html#sec-array.prototype.pop) |\n\n## Browser compatibility\n|  | desktop | mobile | server |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Chrome | Edge | Firefox | Opera | Safari | Chrome Android | Firefox for Android | Opera Android | Safari on iOS | Samsung Internet | WebView Android | WebView on iOS | Deno | Node.js |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `pop` | Chrome – Full support<br>Chrome1<br>Toggle history | Edge – Full support<br>Edge12<br>Toggle history | Firefox – Full support<br>Firefox1<br>Toggle history | Opera – Full support<br>Opera4<br>Toggle history | Safari – Full support<br>Safari1<br>Toggle history | Chrome Android – Full support<br>Chrome Android18<br>Toggle history | Firefox for Android – Full support<br>Firefox for Android4<br>Toggle history | Opera Android – Full support<br>Opera Android10.1<br>Toggle history | Safari on iOS – Full support<br>Safari on iOS1<br>Toggle history | Samsung Internet – Full support<br>Samsung Internet1.0<br>Toggle history | WebView Android – Full support<br>WebView Android4.4<br>Toggle history | WebView on iOS – Full support<br>WebView on iOS1<br>Toggle history | Deno – Full support<br>Deno1.0<br>Toggle history | Node.js – Full support<br>Node.js0.10.0<br>Toggle history |\n\n## See also\n- [Indexed collections](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Indexed_collections) guide\n- [Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)\n- [Array.prototype.push()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push)\n- [Array.prototype.shift()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/shift)\n- [Array.prototype.unshift()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/unshift)\n- [Array.prototype.concat()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat)\n- [Array.prototype.splice()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/pop", "title": "Array.prototype.pop()", "description": "The pop() method of Array instances removes the last element from an array and returns that element.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Array.length\"?\n\nAssistant: The `length` data property of an `Array` instance represents the number of elements in that array. The value is an unsigned, 32-bit integer that is always numerically greater than the highest index in the array.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Value\nA nonnegative integer less than 232.\n\n| Writable | yes |\n| Enumerable | no |\n| Configurable | no |\n\n## Description\nThe value of the `length` property is a nonnegative integer with a value less than 232.\n\nThe array object observes the `length` property, and automatically syncs the `length` value with the array's content. This means:\n\n- Setting `length` to a value smaller than the current length truncates the array — elements beyond the new `length` are deleted.\n- Setting any array index (a nonnegative integer smaller than 232) beyond the current `length` extends the array — the `length` property is increased to reflect the new highest index.\n- Setting `length` to an invalid value (e.g. a negative number or a non-integer) throws a `RangeError` exception.\n\nWhen `length` is set to a bigger value than the current length, the array is extended by adding empty slots, not actual `undefined` values. Empty slots have some special interactions with array methods.\n\n## Examples\n### Iterating over an array\nIn the following example, the array `numbers` is iterated through by looking at the `length` property. The value in each element is then doubled.\n\n```javascript\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nconst length = numbers.length;\nfor (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {\n  numbers[i] *= 2;\n}\n// numbers is now [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n```\n\n### Shortening an array\nThe following example shortens the array `numbers` to a length of 3 if the current length is greater than 3.\n\n```javascript\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n\nif (numbers.length > 3) {\n  numbers.length = 3;\n}\n\nconsole.log(numbers); // [1, 2, 3]\nconsole.log(numbers.length); // 3\nconsole.log(numbers[3]); // undefined; the extra elements are deleted\n```\n\n### Create empty array of fixed length\nSetting `length` to a value greater than the current length creates a sparse array.\n\n```javascript\nconst numbers = [];\nnumbers.length = 3;\nconsole.log(numbers); // [empty x 3]\n```\n\n### Array with non-writable length\nThe `length` property is automatically updated by the array when elements are added beyond the current length. If the `length` property is made non-writable, the array will not be able to update it. This causes an error in strict mode.\n\n```javascript\n\"use strict\";\n\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nObject.defineProperty(numbers, \"length\", { writable: false });\nnumbers[5] = 6; // TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'length' of object '[object Array]'\nnumbers.push(5); // TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'length' of object '[object Array]'\n```\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/length", "title": "Array.length", "description": "The `length` data property of an `Array` instance represents the number of elements in that array.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Object.hasOwnProperty()\"?\n\nAssistant: The hasOwnProperty() method of Object instances returns a boolean indicating whether this object has the specified property as its own property (as opposed to inheriting it).\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Try it\n```javascript\nconst object1 = {};\nobject1.property1 = 42;\n\nconsole.log(object1.hasOwnProperty(\"property1\"));\n// Expected output: true\n\nconsole.log(object1.hasOwnProperty(\"toString\"));\n// Expected output: false\n\nconsole.log(object1.hasOwnProperty(\"hasOwnProperty\"));\n// Expected output: false\n```\n\n## Syntax\n```javascript\nhasOwnProperty(prop)\n```\n\n## Parameters\n`prop`\n\nThe `String` name or `Symbol` of the property to test.\n\n## Return value\nReturns `true` if the object has the specified property as own property; `false` otherwise.\n\n## Description\nThe **`hasOwnProperty()`** method returns `true` if the specified property is a direct property of the object — even if the value is `null` or `undefined`. The method returns `false` if the property is inherited, or has not been declared at all. Unlike the [`in`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/in) operator, this method does not check for the specified property in the object's prototype chain.\n\nThe method can be called on _most_ JavaScript objects, because most objects descend from [`Object`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object), and hence inherit its methods. For example [`Array`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) is an [`Object`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object), so you can use `hasOwnProperty()` method to check whether an index exists:\n\n```javascript\nconst fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Watermelon\", \"Orange\"];\nfruits.hasOwnProperty(3); // true ('Orange')\nfruits.hasOwnProperty(4); // false - not defined\n``` \n\nThe method will not be available in objects where it is reimplemented, or on [`null`-prototype objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object#null-prototype_objects) (as these don't inherit from `Object.prototype`). Examples for these cases are given below.\n\n## Examples\n### Using hasOwnProperty to test for an own property's existence\n\n```javascript\nconst example = {};\nexample.hasOwnProperty(\"prop\"); // false\n\nexample.prop = \"exists\";\nexample.hasOwnProperty(\"prop\"); // true - 'prop' has been defined\n\nexample.prop = null;\nexample.hasOwnProperty(\"prop\"); // true - own property exists with value of null\n\nexample.prop = undefined;\nexample.hasOwnProperty(\"prop\"); // true - own property exists with value of undefined\n```\n\n### Direct vs. inherited properties\n\n```javascript\nconst example = {};\nexample.prop = \"exists\";\n\n// `hasOwnProperty` will only return true for direct properties:\nexample.hasOwnProperty(\"prop\"); // true\nexample.hasOwnProperty(\"toString\"); // false\nexample.hasOwnProperty(\"hasOwnProperty\"); // false\n\n// The `in` operator will return true for direct or inherited properties:\n\"prop\" in example; // true\n\"toString\" in example; // true\n\"hasOwnProperty\" in example; // true\n```\n\n### Iterating over the properties of an object\n\n```javascript\nconst buz = {\n  fog: \"stack\",\n};\n\nfor (const name in buz) {\n  if (buz.hasOwnProperty(name)) {\n    console.log(`this is fog (${name}) for sure.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Object.keys()\"?\n\nAssistant: The `Object.keys()` static method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property names.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Description\n`Object.keys()` returns an array whose elements are strings corresponding to the enumerable string-keyed property names found directly upon `object`. This is the same as iterating with a `for...in` loop, except that a `for...in` loop enumerates properties in the prototype chain as well. The order of the array returned by `Object.keys()` is the same as that provided by a `for...in` loop.\n\nIf you need the property values, use [`Object.values()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/values) instead. If you need both the property keys and values, use [`Object.entries()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/entries) instead.\n\n## Syntax\n`Object.keys(obj)`\n\n## Parameters\n`obj` - An object.\n\n## Return value\nAn array of strings representing the given object's own enumerable string-keyed property keys.\n\n## Examples\n### Using Object.keys()\n\n```javascript\n// Basic array\nconst arr = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"];\nconsole.log(Object.keys(arr)); // ['0', '1', '2']\n\n// Array-like object\nconst obj = { 0: \"a\", 1: \"b\", 2: \"c\" };\nconsole.log(Object.keys(obj)); // ['0', '1', '2']\n\n// Array-like object with random key ordering\nconst anObj = { 100: \"a\", 2: \"b\", 7: \"c\" };\nconsole.log(Object.keys(anObj)); // ['2', '7', '100']\n\n// getFoo is a non-enumerable property\nconst myObj = Object.create(\n  {},\n  {\n    getFoo: {\n      value() {\n        return this.foo;\n      },\n    },\n  },\n);\nmyObj.foo = 1;\nconsole.log(Object.keys(myObj)); // ['foo']\n```\n\nIf you want _all_ string-keyed own properties, including non-enumerable ones, see [`Object.getOwnPropertyNames()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/getOwnPropertyNames).\n\n### Using Object.keys() on primitives\n\nNon-object arguments are [coerced to objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object#object_coercion). [`undefined`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/undefined) and [`null`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/null) cannot be coerced to objects and throw a [`TypeError`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypeError) upfront. Only strings may have own enumerable properties, while all other primitives return an empty array.\n\n```javascript\n// Strings have indices as enumerable own properties\nconsole.log(Object.keys(\"foo\")); // ['0', '1', '2']\n\n// Other primitives except undefined and null have no own properties\nconsole.log(Object.keys(100)); // []\n```\n\n**Note:** In ES5, passing a non-object to `Object.keys()` threw a [`TypeError`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypeError).\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [ECMAScript® 2025 Language Specification<br># sec-object.keys](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/fundamental-objects.html#sec-object.keys) |\n\n## Browser compatibility\n|  | desktop | mobile | server |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Chrome | Edge | Firefox | Opera | Safari | Chrome Android | Firefox for Android | Opera Android | Safari on iOS | Samsung Internet | WebView Android | WebView on iOS | Deno | Node.js |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `keys` | Chrome – Full support<br>Chrome5<br>Toggle history | Edge – Full support<br>Edge12<br>Toggle history | Firefox – Full support<br>Firefox4<br>Toggle history | Opera – Full support<br>Opera12<br>Toggle history | Safari – Full support<br>Safari5<br>Toggle history | Chrome Android – Full support<br>Chrome Android18<br>Toggle history | Firefox for Android – Full support<br>Firefox for Android4<br>Toggle history | Opera Android – Full support<br>Opera Android12<br>Toggle history | Safari on iOS – Full support<br>Safari on iOS5<br>Toggle history | Samsung Internet – Full support<br>Samsung Internet1.0<br>Toggle history | WebView Android – Full support<br>WebView Android4.4<br>Toggle history | WebView on iOS – Full support<br>WebView on iOS5<br>Toggle history | Deno – Full support<br>Deno1.0<br>Toggle history | Node.js – Full support<br>Node.js0.10.0<br>Toggle history |\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys", "title": "Object.keys()", "description": "The `Object.keys()` static method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property names.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 7, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 02:53:39", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"position": ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6"], "language": "en-US", "og:image:height": "1080", "og:image:width": "1920", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "ogDescription": "The Object.keys() static method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property names.", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "The Object.keys() static method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property names.", "og:type": "website", "og:locale": "en_US", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "title": "Object.keys() - JavaScript | MDN", "og:image:type": "image/png", "og:title": "Object.keys() - JavaScript | MDN", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys", "ogTitle": "Object.keys() - JavaScript | MDN", "og:description": "The Object.keys() static method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property names.", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "ogLocale": "en_US", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "scrapeId": "2b3635f8-a216-4ac5-a812-507752f607c5", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Array.prototype.at()\"?\n\nAssistant: The `at()` method of Array instances takes an integer value and returns the item at that index, allowing for positive and negative integers. Negative integers count back from the last item in the array.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Try it\n```javascript\nconst array1 = [5, 12, 8, 130, 44];\n\nlet index = 2;\n\nconsole.log(`An index of ${index} returns ${array1.at(index)}`);\n// Expected output: \"An index of 2 returns 8\"\n\nindex = -2;\n\nconsole.log(`An index of ${index} returns ${array1.at(index)}`);\n// Expected output: \"An index of -2 returns 130\"\n```\n\n## Syntax\n```javascript\nat(index)\n```\n\n## Parameters\n`index` is the zero-based index of the array element to be returned, converted to an integer. Negative index counts back from the end of the array — if `index < 0`, `index + array.length` is accessed.\n\n## Return value\nThe element in the array matching the given index. Always returns `undefined` if `index < -array.length` or `index >= array.length` without attempting to access the corresponding property.\n\n## Description\nThe `at()` method is equivalent to the bracket notation when `index` is a non-negative integer. For example, `array[0]` and `array.at(0)` both return the first item. However, when counting elements from the end of the array, you cannot use `array[-1]` like you may in Python or R, because all values inside the square brackets are treated literally as string properties, so you will end up reading `array[\"-1\"]`, which is just a normal string property instead of an array index.\n\nThe usual practice is to access `length` and calculate the index from that — for example, `array[array.length - 1]`. The `at()` method allows relative indexing, so this can be shortened to `array.at(-1)`. By combining `at()` with `with()`, you can both read and write (respectively) an array using negative indices. The `at()` method is generic. It only expects the `this` value to have a `length` property and integer-keyed properties.\n\n## Examples\n### Return the last value of an array\n```javascript\n// Our array with items\nconst cart = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"pear\"];\n\n// A function which returns the last item of a given array\nfunction returnLast(arr) {\n  return arr.at(-1);\n}\n\n// Get the last item of our array 'cart'\nconst item1 = returnLast(cart);\nconsole.log(item1); // 'pear'\n\n// Add an item to our 'cart' array\ncart.push(\"orange\");\nconst item2 = returnLast(cart);\nconsole.log(item2); // 'orange'\n```\n\n### Comparing methods\n```javascript\n// Our array with items\nconst colors = [\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"];\n\n// Using length property\nconst lengthWay = colors[colors.length - 2];\nconsole.log(lengthWay); // 'green'\n\n// Using slice() method. Note an array is returned\nconst sliceWay = colors.slice(-2, -1);\nconsole.log(sliceWay[0]); // 'green'\n\n// Using at() method\nconst atWay = colors.at(-2);\nconsole.log(atWay); // 'green'\n```\n\n### Calling at() on non-array objects\n```javascript\nconst arrayLike = {\n  length: 2,\n  0: \"a\",\n  1: \"b\",\n  2: \"c\", // ignored by at() since length is 2\n};\nconsole.log(Array.prototype.at.call(arrayLike, 0)); // \"a\"\nconsole.log(Array.prototype.at.call(arrayLike, 2)); // undefined\n```\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [ECMAScript® 2025 Language Specification<br># sec-array.prototype.at](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/indexed-collections.html#sec-array.prototype.at) |\n\n## Browser compatibility\n|  | desktop | mobile | server |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Chrome | Edge | Firefox | Opera | Safari | Chrome Android | Firefox for Android | Opera Android | Safari on iOS | Samsung Internet | WebView Android | WebView on iOS | Deno | Node.js |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `at` | Chrome – Full support<br>Chrome92<br>Toggle history | Edge – Full support<br>Edge92<br>Toggle history | Firefox – Full support<br>Firefox90<br>Toggle history | Opera – Full support<br>Opera78<br>Toggle history | Safari – Full support<br>Safari15.4<br>Toggle history | Chrome Android – Full support<br>Chrome Android92<br>Toggle history | Firefox for Android – Full support<br>Firefox for Android90<br>Toggle history | Opera Android – Full support<br>Opera Android65<br>Toggle history | Safari on iOS – Full support<br>Safari on iOS15.4<br>Toggle history | Samsung Internet – Full support<br>Samsung Internet16.0<br>Toggle history | WebView Android – Full support<br>WebView Android92<br>Toggle history | WebView on iOS – Full support<br>WebView on iOS15.4<br>Toggle history | Deno – Full support<br>Deno1.12<br>Toggle history | Node.js – Full support<br>Node.js16.6.0<br>Toggle history |\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/at", "title": "Array.prototype.at()", "description": "The `at()` method of Array instances takes an integer value and returns the item at that index, allowing for positive and negative integers.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Object.entries()\"?\n\nAssistant: The `Object.entries()` static method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property key-value pairs.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Description\n`Object.entries()` returns an array whose elements are arrays corresponding to the enumerable string-keyed property key-value pairs found directly upon `object`. This is the same as iterating with a [`for...in`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in) loop, except that a `for...in` loop enumerates properties in the prototype chain as well. The order of the array returned by `Object.entries()` is the same as that provided by a [`for...in`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in) loop.\n\nIf you only need the property keys, use [`Object.keys()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys) instead. If you only need the property values, use [`Object.values()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/values) instead.\n\n## Syntax\n`Object.entries(obj)`\n\n## Parameters\n[`obj`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/entries#obj)\n\nAn object.\n\n## Return value\nAn array of the given object's own enumerable string-keyed property key-value pairs. Each key-value pair is an array with two elements: the first element is the property key (which is always a string), and the second element is the property value.\n\n## Examples\n### Using Object.entries()\n```javascript\nconst obj = { foo: \"bar\", baz: 42 };\nconsole.log(Object.entries(obj)); // [ ['foo', 'bar'], ['baz', 42] ]\n\nconst arrayLike = { 0: \"a\", 1: \"b\", 2: \"c\" };\nconsole.log(Object.entries(arrayLike)); // [ ['0', 'a'], ['1', 'b'], ['2', 'c'] ]\n\nconst randomKeyOrder = { 100: \"a\", 2: \"b\", 7: \"c\" };\nconsole.log(Object.entries(randomKeyOrder)); // [ ['2', 'b'], ['7', 'c'], ['100', 'a'] ]\n\n// getFoo is a non-enumerable property\nconst myObj = Object.create(\n  {},\n  {\n    getFoo: {\n      value() {\n        return this.foo;\n      },\n    },\n  },\n);\nmyObj.foo = \"bar\";\nconsole.log(Object.entries(myObj)); // [ ['foo', 'bar'] ]\n```\n\n### Using Object.entries() on primitives\nNon-object arguments are [coerced to objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object#object_coercion). [`undefined`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/undefined) and [`null`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/null) cannot be coerced to objects and throw a [`TypeError`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypeError) upfront. Only strings may have own enumerable properties, while all other primitives return an empty array.\n```javascript\n// Strings have indices as enumerable own properties\nconsole.log(Object.entries(\"foo\")); // [ ['0', 'f'], ['1', 'o'], ['2', 'o'] ]\n\n// Other primitives except undefined and null have no own properties\nconsole.log(Object.entries(100)); // []\n```\n\n### Converting an Object to a Map\nThe [`Map()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map/Map) constructor accepts an iterable of `entries`. With `Object.entries`, you can easily convert from [`Object`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object) to [`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map):\n```javascript\nconst obj = { foo: \"bar\", baz: 42 };\nconst map = new Map(Object.entries(obj));\nconsole.log(map); // Map(2) {\"foo\" => \"bar\", \"baz\" => 42}\n```\n\n### Iterating through an Object\nUsing [array destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment#array_destructuring), you can iterate through objects easily.\n```javascript\n// Using for...of loop\nconst obj = { a: 5, b: 7, c: 9 };\nfor (const [key, value] of Object.entries(obj)) {\n  console.log(`${key} ${value}`); // \"a 5\", \"b 7\", \"c 9\"\n}\n\n// Using array methods\nObject.entries(obj).forEach(([key, value]) => {\n  console.log(`${key} ${value}`); // \"a 5\", \"b 7\", \"c 9\"\n});\n```\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/entries", "title": "Object.entries()", "description": "The `Object.entries()` static method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property key-value pairs.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 5, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 02:55:00", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:image:type": "image/png", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:description": "The Object.entries() static method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property key-value pairs.", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "og:type": "website", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "position": ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6"], "language": "en-US", "og:image:height": "1080", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/entries", "og:locale": "en_US", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "ogLocale": "en_US", "title": "Object.entries() - JavaScript | MDN", "ogDescription": "The Object.entries() static method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property key-value pairs.", "ogTitle": "Object.entries() - JavaScript | MDN", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "The Object.entries() static method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property key-value pairs.", "og:title": "Object.entries() - JavaScript | MDN", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/entries", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:image:width": "1920", "scrapeId": "8f8f91ff-fd20-4841-939e-4cfa96e7179a", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/entries", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/entries", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Date.prototype.toLocaleString()\"?\n\nAssistant: The toLocaleString() method of Date instances returns a string with a language-sensitive representation of this date in the local timezone.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Overview\nThe `toLocaleString()` method of [`Date`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) instances returns a string with a language-sensitive representation of this date in the local timezone. In implementations with [`Intl.DateTimeFormat` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat) support, this method delegates to `Intl.DateTimeFormat`.\n\n## Performance Consideration\nEvery time `toLocaleString` is called, it has to perform a search in a big database of localization strings, which is potentially inefficient. When the method is called many times with the same arguments, it is better to create a [`Intl.DateTimeFormat`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat) object and use its [`format()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat/format) method, because a `DateTimeFormat` object remembers the arguments passed to it and may decide to cache a slice of the database, so future `format` calls can search for localization strings within a more constrained context.\n\n## Syntax\n```\ntoLocaleString()\ntoLocaleString(locales)\ntoLocaleString(locales, options)\n```\n\n## Parameters\nThe `locales` and `options` parameters customize the behavior of the function and let applications specify the language whose formatting conventions should be used.\n\nIn implementations that support the [`Intl.DateTimeFormat` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat), these parameters correspond exactly to the [`Intl.DateTimeFormat()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat/DateTimeFormat) constructor's parameters. Implementations without `Intl.DateTimeFormat` support are asked to ignore both parameters, making the locale used and the form of the string returned entirely implementation-dependent.\n\n## Return value\nA string representing the given date according to language-specific conventions.\n\nIn implementations with `Intl.DateTimeFormat`, this is equivalent to `new Intl.DateTimeFormat(locales, options).format(date)`.\n\n## Examples\n### Using toLocaleString()\nBasic use of this method without specifying a `locale` returns a formatted string in the default locale and with default options.\n\n```\nconst date = new Date(Date.UTC(2012, 11, 12, 3, 0, 0));\n\n// toLocaleString() without arguments depends on the\n// implementation, the default locale, and the default time zone\nconsole.log(date.toLocaleString());\n// \"12/11/2012, 7:00:00 PM\" if run in en-US locale with time zone America/Los_Angeles\n```\n\n### Checking for support for locales and options parameters\nThe `locales` and `options` parameters may not be supported in all implementations, because support for the internationalization API is optional, and some systems may not have the necessary data. For implementations without internationalization support, `toLocaleString()` always uses the system's locale, which may not be what you want. Because any implementation that supports the `locales` and `options` parameters must support the [`Intl`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl) API, you can check the existence of the latter for support:\n\n```\nfunction toLocaleStringSupportsLocales() {\n  return (\n    typeof Intl === \"object\" &&\n    !!Intl &&\n    typeof Intl.DateTimeFormat === \"function\"\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Using locales\nThis example shows some of the variations in localized date and time formats. In order to get the format of the language used in the user interface of your application, make sure to specify that language (and possibly some fallback languages) using the `locales` argument:\n\n```\nconst date = new Date(Date.UTC(2012, 11, 20, 3, 0, 0));\n\n// Formats below assume the local time zone of the locale;\n// America/Los_Angeles for the US\n\n// US English uses month-day-year order and 12-hour time with AM/PM\nconsole.log(date.toLocaleString(\"en-US\"));\n// \"12/19/2012, 7:00:00 PM\"\n\n// British English uses day-month-year order and 24-hour time without AM/PM\nconsole.log(date.toLocaleString(\"en-GB\"));\n// \"20/12/2012 03:00:00\"\n\n// Korean uses year-month-day order and 12-hour time with AM/PM\nconsole.log(date.toLocaleString(\"ko-KR\"));\n// \"2012. 12. 20. 오후 12:00:00\"\n\n// Arabic in most Arabic-speaking countries uses Eastern Arabic numerals\nconsole.log(date.toLocaleString(\"ar-EG\"));\n// \"٢٠‏/١٢‏/٢٠١٢ ٥:٠٠:٠٠ ص\"\n\n// For Japanese, applications may want to use the Japanese calendar,\n// where 2012 was the year 24 of the Heisei era\nconsole.log(date.toLocaleString(\"ja-JP-u-ca-japanese\"));\n// \"24/12/20 12:00:00\"\n\n// When requesting a language that may not be supported, such as\n// Balinese, include a fallback language (in this case, Indonesian)\nconsole.log(date.toLocaleString([\"ban\", \"id\"]));\n// \"20/12/2012 11.00.00\"\n```\n\n### Using options\nThe results provided by `toLocaleString()` can be customized using the `options` parameter:\n\n```\nconst date = new Date(Date.UTC(2012, 11, 20, 3, 0, 0));\n\n// Request a weekday along with a long date\nconst options = {\n  weekday: \"long\",\n  year: \"numeric\",\n  month: \"long\",\n  day: \"numeric\",\n};\nconsole.log(date.toLocaleString(\"de-DE\", options));\n// \"Donnerstag, 20. Dezember 2012\"\n\n// An application may want to use UTC and make that visible\noptions.timeZone = \"UTC\";\noptions.timeZoneName = \"short\";\nconsole.log(date.toLocaleString(\"en-US\", options));\n// \"Thursday, December 20, 2012, GMT\"\n\n// Sometimes even the US needs 24-hour time\nconsole.log(date.toLocaleString(\"en-US\", { hour12: false }));\n// \"12/19/2012, 19:00:00\"\n```\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toLocaleString", "title": "Date.prototype.toLocaleString()", "description": "The toLocaleString() method of Date instances returns a string with a language-sensitive representation of this date in the local timezone.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 6, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 02:55:31", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:locale": "en_US", "og:image:height": "1080", "title": "Date.prototype.toLocaleString() - JavaScript | MDN", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "The toLocaleString() method of Date instances returns a string with a language-sensitive representation of this date in the local timezone.

More formally, in this case the substring starts at max(start + str.length, 0).\n- If start is omitted or undefined, it's treated as 0.\n- If length is omitted or undefined, or if start + length >= str.length, substr() extracts characters to the end of the string.\n- If length < 0, an empty string is returned.\n- For both start and length, NaN is treated as 0.\n\n## Syntax\n```\nsubstr(start)\nsubstr(start, length)\n```\n\n## Parameters\n[`start`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/substr#start)\n\nThe index of the first character to include in the returned substring.\n\n[`length` Optional](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/substr#length)\n\nThe number of characters to extract.\n\n## Return value\nA new string containing the specified part of the given string.\n\n## Examples\n### Using substr()\n\n```\nconst aString = \"Mozilla\";\n\nconsole.log(aString.substr(0, 1)); // 'M'\nconsole.log(aString.substr(1, 0)); // ''\nconsole.log(aString.substr(-1, 1)); // 'a'\nconsole.log(aString.substr(1, -1)); // ''\nconsole.log(aString.substr(-3)); // 'lla'\nconsole.log(aString.substr(1)); // 'ozilla'\nconsole.log(aString.substr(-20, 2)); // 'Mo'\nconsole.log(aString.substr(20, 2)); // ''\n```\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [ECMAScript® 2025 Language Specification<br># sec-string.prototype.substr](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/additional-ecmascript-features-for-web-browsers.html#sec-string.prototype.substr) |\n\n## Browser compatibility\n|  | desktop | mobile | server |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Chrome | Edge | Firefox | Opera | Safari | Chrome Android | Firefox for Android | Opera Android | Safari on iOS | Samsung Internet | WebView Android | WebView on iOS | Deno | Node.js |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `substr` <br>Deprecated | Chrome – Full support<br>Chrome1<br>Toggle history | Edge – Full support<br>Edge12<br>Toggle history | Firefox – Full support<br>Firefox1<br>Toggle history | Opera – Full support<br>Opera4<br>Toggle history | Safari – Full support<br>Safari1<br>Toggle history | Chrome Android – Full support<br>Chrome Android18<br>Toggle history | Firefox for Android – Full support<br>Firefox for Android4<br>Toggle history | Opera Android – Full support<br>Opera Android10.1<br>Toggle history | Safari on iOS – Full support<br>Safari on iOS1<br>Toggle history | Samsung Internet – Full support<br>Samsung Internet1.0<br>Toggle history | WebView Android – Full support<br>WebView Android4.4<br>Toggle history | WebView on iOS – Full support<br>WebView on iOS1<br>Toggle history | Deno – Full support<br>Deno1.0<br>Toggle history | Node.js – Full support<br>Node.js0.10.0<br>Toggle history |\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/substr", "title": "String.prototype.substr()", "description": "The substr() method of String values returns a portion of this string, starting at the specified index and extending for a given number of characters afterwards.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 8, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 02:56:00", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "language": "en-US", "description": "The substr() method of String values returns a portion of this string, starting at the specified index and extending for a given number of characters afterwards.", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "ogDescription": "The substr() method of String values returns a portion of this string, starting at the specified index and extending for a given number of characters afterwards.", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "ogLocale": "en_US", "og:image:width": "1920", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "og:title": "String.prototype.substr() - JavaScript | MDN", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "og:image:type": "image/png", "og:description": "The substr() method of String values returns a portion of this string, starting at the specified index and extending for a given number of characters afterwards.", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/substr", "ogTitle": "String.prototype.substr() - JavaScript | MDN", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:locale": "en_US", "og:image:height": "1080", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/substr", "og:type": "website", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "position": ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6"], "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "title": "String.prototype.substr() - JavaScript | MDN", "scrapeId": "a03b1b0f-8741-48a5-b5a9-3c99ef2e2cbc", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/substr", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/substr", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Object.freeze()\"?\n\nAssistant: The `Object.freeze()` static method freezes an object, preventing extensions and making existing properties non-writable and non-configurable.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Try it\n```javascript\nconst obj = {\n  prop: 42,\n};\n\nObject.freeze(obj);\n\nobj.prop = 33; // Throws an error in strict mode\n\nconsole.log(obj.prop); // Expected output: 42\n```\n\n## Syntax\n```javascript\nObject.freeze(obj)\n```\n\n## Parameters\n`obj`\n\nThe object to freeze.\n\n## Return value\nThe object that was passed to the function.\n\n## Description\nFreezing an object is equivalent to preventing extensions and then changing all existing properties' descriptors `configurable` to `false` — and for data properties, `writable` to `false` as well. Nothing can be added to or removed from the properties set of a frozen object. Any attempt to do so will fail, either silently or by throwing a `TypeError` exception (most commonly, but not exclusively, when in strict mode). For data properties of a frozen object, their values cannot be changed since the `writable` and configurable attributes are set to `false`. Accessor properties (getters and setters) work the same — the property value returned by the getter may still change, and the setter can still be called without throwing errors when setting the property. Note that values that are objects can still be modified, unless they are also frozen. As an object, an array can be frozen; after doing so, its elements cannot be altered and no elements can be added to or removed from the array.\n\n## Examples\n### Freezing objects\n```javascript\nconst obj = {\n  prop() {},\n  foo: \"bar\",\n};\n\n// Before freezing: new properties may be added,\n// and existing properties may be changed or removed\nobj.foo = \"baz\";\nobj.lumpy = \"woof\";\ndelete obj.prop;\n\n// Freeze.\nconst o = Object.freeze(obj);\n\n// The return value is just the same object we passed in.\no === obj; // true\n\n// The object has become frozen.\nObject.isFrozen(obj); // === true\n\n// Now any changes will fail\nobj.foo = \"quux\"; // silently does nothing\n// silently doesn't add the property\nobj.quaxxor = \"the friendly duck\";\n\n// In strict mode such attempts will throw TypeErrors\nfunction fail() {\n  \"use strict\";\n  obj.foo = \"sparky\"; // throws a TypeError\n  delete obj.foo; // throws a TypeError\n  delete obj.quaxxor; // returns true since attribute 'quaxxor' was never added\n  obj.sparky = \"arf\"; // throws a TypeError\n}\n\nfail();\n\n// Attempted changes through Object.defineProperty;\n// both statements below throw a TypeError.\nObject.defineProperty(obj, \"ohai\", { value: 17 });\nObject.defineProperty(obj, \"foo\", { value: \"eit\" });\n\n// It's also impossible to change the prototype\n// both statements below will throw a TypeError.\nObject.setPrototypeOf(obj, { x: 20 });\nobj.__proto__ = { x: 20 };\n```\n\n### Freezing arrays\n```javascript\nconst a = [0];\nObject.freeze(a); // The array cannot be modified now.\n\na[0] = 1; // fails silently\n\n// In strict mode such attempt will throw a TypeError\nfunction fail() {\n  \"use strict\";\n  a[0] = 1;\n}\n\nfail();\n\n// Attempted to push\na.push(2); // throws a TypeError\n```\n\nThe object being frozen is _immutable_. However, it is not necessarily constant. The following example shows that a frozen object is not constant (freeze is shallow).\n```javascript\nconst obj1 = {\n  internal: {},\n};\n\nObject.freeze(obj1);\nobj1.internal.a = \"aValue\";\n\nobj1.internal.a; // 'aValue'\n```\n\nTo be a constant object, the entire reference graph (direct and indirect references to other objects) must reference only immutable frozen objects. The object being frozen is said to be immutable because the entire object _state_ (values and references to other objects) within the whole object is fixed. Note that strings, numbers, and booleans are always immutable and that Functions and Arrays are objects.\n\n## Deep freezing\nThe result of calling `Object.freeze(object)` only applies to the immediate properties of `object` itself and will prevent future property addition, removal or value re-assignment operations _only_ on `object`. If the value of those properties are objects themselves, those objects are not frozen and may be the target of property addition, removal or value re-assignment operations.\n\n```javascript\nconst employee = {\n  name: \"Mayank\",\n  designation: \"Developer\",\n  address: {\n    street: \"Rohini\",\n    city: \"Delhi\",\n  },\n};\n\nObject.freeze(employee);\n\nemployee.name = \"Dummy\"; // fails silently in non-strict mode\nemployee.address.city = \"Noida\"; // attributes of child object can be modified\n\nconsole.log(employee.address.city); // \"Noida\"\n```\n\nTo make an object immutable, recursively freeze each non-primitive property (deep freeze). Use the pattern on a case-by-case basis based on your design when you know the object contains no cycles in the reference graph, otherwise an endless loop will be triggered. For example, functions created with the `function` syntax have a `prototype` property with a `constructor` property that points to the function itself, so they have cycles by default. Other functions, such as arrow functions, can still be frozen.\n\nAn enhancement to `deepFreeze()` would be to store the objects it has already visited, so you can suppress calling `deepFreeze()` recursively when an object is in the process of being made immutable. For one example, see using `WeakSet` to detect circular references. You still run a risk of freezing an object that shouldn't be frozen, such as `window`.\n\n```javascript\nfunction deepFreeze(object) {\n  // Retrieve the property names defined on object\n  const propNames = Reflect.ownKeys(object);\n\n  // Freeze properties before freezing self\n  for (const name of propNames) {\n    const value = object[name];\n\n    if ((value && typeof value === \"object\") || typeof value === \"function\") {\n      deepFreeze(value);\n    }\n  }\n\n  return Object.freeze(object);\n}\n\nconst obj2 = {\n  internal: {\n    a: null,\n  },\n};\n\ndeepFreeze(obj2);\n\nobj2.internal.a = \"anotherValue\"; // fails silently in non-strict mode\nobj2.internal.a; // null\n```\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/freeze", "title": "Object.freeze()", "description": "The `Object.freeze()` static method freezes an object, preventing extensions and making existing properties non-writable and non-configurable.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 7, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 02:56:29", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"title": "Object.freeze() - JavaScript | MDN", "og:description": "The Object.freeze() static method freezes an object.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Math.round()\"?\n\nAssistant: The `Math.round()` static method returns the value of a number rounded to the nearest integer.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Try it\n```javascript\nconsole.log(Math.round(0.9));\n// Expected output: 1\n\nconsole.log(Math.round(5.95), Math.round(5.5), Math.round(5.05));\n// Expected output: 6 6 5\n\nconsole.log(Math.round(-5.05), Math.round(-5.5), Math.round(-5.95));\n// Expected output: -5 -5 -6\n```\n\n## Syntax\n```javascript\nMath.round(x)\n```\n\n## Parameters\n`x`\n\nA number.\n\n## Return value\nThe value of `x` rounded to the nearest integer.\n\n## Description\nIf the fractional portion of the argument is greater than 0.5, the argument is rounded to the integer with the next higher absolute value. If it is less than 0.5, the argument is rounded to the integer with the lower absolute value. If the fractional portion is exactly 0.5, the argument is rounded to the next integer in the direction of +∞.\n\n**Note:** This differs from many languages' `round()` functions, which often round half-increments _away from zero_, giving a different result in the case of negative numbers with a fractional part of exactly 0.5.\n\n`Math.round(x)` is not exactly the same as `Math.floor(x + 0.5)`. When `x` is -0, or -0.5 ≤ x < 0, `Math.round(x)` returns -0, while `Math.floor(x + 0.5)` returns 0. However, neglecting that difference and potential precision errors, `Math.round(x)` and `Math.floor(x + 0.5)` are generally equivalent.\n\nBecause `round()` is a static method of `Math`, you always use it as `Math.round()`, rather than as a method of a `Math` object you created ( `Math` has no constructor).\n\n## Examples\n### Using round\n```javascript\nMath.round(-Infinity);

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Object.groupBy()\"?\n\nAssistant: The Object.groupBy() static method groups the elements of a given iterable according to the string values returned by a provided callback function. The returned object has separate properties for each group, containing arrays with the elements in the group.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Syntax\n```javascript\nObject.groupBy(items, callbackFn)\n```\n\n## Parameters\n- `items`: An iterable (such as an Array) whose elements will be grouped.\n- `callbackFn`: A function to execute for each element in the iterable. It should return a value that can get coerced into a property key (string or symbol) indicating the group of the current element. The function is called with the following arguments:\n  - `element`: The current element being processed.\n  - `index`: The index of the current element being processed.\n\n## Return value\nA null-prototype object with properties for all groups, each assigned to an array containing the elements of the associated group.\n\n## Description\nObject.groupBy() calls a provided callbackFn function once for each element in an iterable. The callback function should return a string or symbol indicating the group of the associated element. The values returned by callbackFn are used as keys for the object returned by Object.groupBy(). Each key has an associated array containing all the elements for which the callback returned the same value. The elements in the returned object and the original iterable are the same.\n\n## Examples\n### Using Object.groupBy()\nFirst we define an array containing objects representing an inventory of different foodstuffs. Each food has a `type` and a `quantity`.\n\n```javascript\nconst inventory = [\n  { name: \"asparagus\", type: \"vegetables\", quantity: 5 },\n  { name: \"bananas\", type: \"fruit\", quantity: 0 },\n  { name: \"goat\", type: \"meat\", quantity: 23 },\n  { name: \"cherries\", type: \"fruit\", quantity: 5 },\n  { name: \"fish\", type: \"meat\", quantity: 22 },\n];\n```\n\nThe code below groups the elements by the value of their `type` property.\n\n```javascript\nconst result = Object.groupBy(inventory, ({ type }) => type);\n\n/* Result is:\n{\n  vegetables: [\n    { name: 'asparagus', type: 'vegetables', quantity: 5 },\n  ],\n  fruit: [\n    { name: \"bananas\", type: \"fruit\", quantity: 0 },\n    { name: \"cherries\", type: \"fruit\", quantity: 5 }\n  ],\n  meat: [\n    { name: \"goat\", type: \"meat\", quantity: 23 },\n    { name: \"fish\", type: \"meat\", quantity: 22 }\n  ]\n}\n*/\n```\n\nThe arrow function just returns the `type` of each array element each time it is called. Note that the function argument `{ type }` is a basic example of object destructuring syntax for function arguments.\n\nWe can also create groups inferred from values in one or more properties of the elements. Below is a very similar example that puts the items into `ok` or `restock` groups based on the value of the `quantity` field.\n\n```javascript\nfunction myCallback({ quantity }) {\n  return quantity > 5 ? \"ok\" : \"restock\";\n}\n\nconst result2 = Object.groupBy(inventory, myCallback);\n\n/* Result is:\n{\n  restock: [\n    { name: \"asparagus\", type: \"vegetables\", quantity: 5 },\n    { name: \"bananas\", type: \"fruit\", quantity: 0 },\n    { name: \"cherries\", type: \"fruit\", quantity: 5 }\n  ],\n  ok: [\n    { name: \"goat\", type: \"meat\", quantity: 23 },\n    { name: \"fish\", type: \"meat\", quantity: 22 }\n  ]\n}\n*/\n```\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [ECMAScript® 2025 Language Specification<br># sec-object.groupby](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/keyed-collections.html#sec-object.groupby) |\n\n## Browser compatibility\n\n\n## See also\n- [Polyfill of `Object.groupBy` in `core-js`](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js#array-grouping)\n- [Indexed collections](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Indexed_collections) guide\n- [`Array.prototype.reduce()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce)\n- [`Object.fromEntries()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/fromEntries)\n- [`Map.groupBy()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map/groupBy)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/groupBy", "title": "Object.groupBy()", "description": "The Object.groupBy() static method groups the elements of a given iterable according to the string values returned by a provided callback function.

Every time, the return value of `callbackFn` is passed into `callbackFn` again on next invocation as `accumulator`. The final value of `accumulator` (which is the value returned from `callbackFn` on the final iteration of the array) becomes the return value of `reduce()...\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce", "title": "Array.prototype.reduce()", "description": "The `reduce()` method of Array instances executes a user-supplied \"reducer\" callback function on each element of the array, in order, passing in the return value from the calculation on the preceding element.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Math.floor()\"?\n\nAssistant: The Math.floor() static method always rounds down and returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Try it\n```javascript\nconsole.log(Math.floor(5.95));\n// Expected output: 5\n\nconsole.log(Math.floor(5.05));\n// Expected output: 5\n\nconsole.log(Math.floor(5));\n// Expected output: 5\n\nconsole.log(Math.floor(-5.05));\n// Expected output: -6\n```\n\n## Syntax\n```javascript\nMath.floor(x)\n```\n\n## Parameters\n`x`\n\nA number.\n\n## Return value\nThe largest integer smaller than or equal to `x`. It's the same value as `-Math.ceil(-x)`.\n\n## Description\nBecause `floor()` is a static method of `Math`, you always use it as `Math.floor()`, rather than as a method of a `Math` object you created ( `Math` is not a constructor).\n\n## Examples\n### Using Math.floor()\n```javascript\nMath.floor(-Infinity); // -Infinity\nMath.floor(-45.95); // -46\nMath.floor(-45.05); // -46\nMath.floor(-0); // -0\nMath.floor(0); // 0\nMath.floor(4); // 4\nMath.floor(45.05); // 45\nMath.floor(45.95); // 45\nMath.floor(Infinity); // Infinity\n```\n\n## Decimal adjustment\nIn this example, we implement a method called `decimalAdjust()` that is an enhancement method of `Math.floor()`, `Math.ceil()`, and `Math.round()`. While the three `Math` functions always adjust the input to the units digit, `decimalAdjust` accepts an `exp` parameter that specifies the number of digits to the left of the decimal point to which the number should be adjusted. For example, `-1` means it would leave one digit after the decimal point (as in \"× 10-1\"). In addition, it allows you to select the means of adjustment — `round`, `floor`, or `ceil` — through the `type` parameter.\n\nIt does so by multiplying the number by a power of 10, then rounding the result to the nearest integer, then dividing by the power of 10. To better preserve precision, it takes advantage of Number's `toString()` method, which represents large or small numbers in scientific notation (like `6.02e23`).\n\n```javascript\n/**\n * Adjusts a number to the specified digit.\n *\n * @param {\"round\" | \"floor\" | \"ceil\"} type The type of adjustment.\n * @param {number} value The number.\n * @param {number} exp The exponent (the 10 logarithm of the adjustment base).\n * @returns {number} The adjusted value.\n */\nfunction decimalAdjust(type, value, exp) {\n  type = String(type);\n  if (![\"round\", \"floor\", \"ceil\"].includes(type)) {\n    throw new TypeError(\n      \"The type of decimal adjustment must be one of 'round', 'floor', or 'ceil'.\",\n    );\n  }\n  exp = Number(exp);\n  value = Number(value);\n  if (exp % 1 !== 0 || Number.isNaN(value)) {\n    return NaN;\n  } else if (exp === 0) {\n    return Math[type](value);\n  }\n  const [magnitude, exponent = 0] = value.toString().split(\"e\");\n  const adjustedValue = Math[type](`${magnitude}e${exponent - exp}`);\n  // Shift back\n  const [newMagnitude, newExponent = 0] = adjustedValue.toString().split(\"e\");\n  return Number(`${newMagnitude}e${+newExponent + exp}`);\n}\n\n// Decimal round\nconst round10 = (value, exp) => decimalAdjust(\"round\", value, exp);\n// Decimal floor\nconst floor10 = (value, exp) => decimalAdjust(\"floor\", value, exp);\n// Decimal ceil\nconst ceil10 = (value, exp) => decimalAdjust(\"ceil\", value, exp);\n\n// Round\nround10(55.55, -1);

Note that this special case only applies to JavaScript arrays created with the `Array` constructor, not array literals created with the square bracket syntax.\n\n[`arrayLength`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Array#arraylength)\n\nIf the only argument passed to the `Array` constructor is an integer between 0 and 232 - 1 (inclusive), this returns a new JavaScript array with its `length` property set to that number ( **Note:** this implies an array of `arrayLength` empty slots, not slots with actual `undefined` values — see [sparse arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Indexed_collections#sparse_arrays)).\n\n## Exceptions\n[`RangeError`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RangeError)\n\nThrown if there's only one argument ( `arrayLength`) that is a number, but its value is not an integer or not between 0 and 232 - 1 (inclusive).\n\n## Examples\n### [Array literal notation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Array#array_literal_notation)\n\nArrays can be created using the [literal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types#array_literals) notation:\n\n```javascript\nconst fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Banana\"];\n\nconsole.log(fruits.length); // 2\nconsole.log(fruits[0]); // \"Apple\"\n```\n\n### [Array constructor with a single parameter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Array#array_constructor_with_a_single_parameter)\n\nArrays can be created using a constructor with a single number parameter. An array is created with its `length` property set to that number, and the array elements are empty slots.\n\n```javascript\nconst arrayEmpty = new Array(2);\n\nconsole.log(arrayEmpty.length); // 2\nconsole.log(arrayEmpty[0]); // undefined; actually, it is an empty slot\nconsole.log(0 in arrayEmpty); // false\nconsole.log(1 in arrayEmpty); // false\n```\n\n```javascript\nconst arrayOfOne = new Array(\"2\"); // Not the number 2 but the string \"2\"\n\nconsole.log(arrayOfOne.length); // 1\nconsole.log(arrayOfOne[0]); // \"2\"\n```\n\n### [Array constructor with multiple parameters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Array#array_constructor_with_multiple_parameters)\n\nIf more than one argument is passed to the constructor, a new [`Array`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) with the given elements is created.\n\n```javascript\nconst fruits = new Array(\"Apple\", \"Banana\");\n\nconsole.log(fruits.length); // 2\nconsole.log(fruits[0]); // \"Apple\"\n```\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Array", "title": "Array", "description": "The `Array()` constructor creates Array objects.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 4, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 02:59:34", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"language": "en-US", "og:image:width": "1920", "og:description": "The Array() constructor creates Array objects.", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "ogLocale": "en_US", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Array", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Array", "title": "Array() constructor - JavaScript | MDN", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "og:title": "Array() constructor - JavaScript | MDN", "og:type": "website", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "position": ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6"], "og:image:height": "1080", "description": "The Array() constructor creates Array objects.", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "ogTitle": "Array() constructor - JavaScript | MDN", "og:locale": "en_US", "ogDescription": "The Array() constructor creates Array objects.", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:image:type": "image/png", "scrapeId": "b1535c6a-6137-463d-a0b5-6637ff039894", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Array", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Array", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Date.prototype.toLocaleDateString()\"?\n\nAssistant: The toLocaleDateString() method of Date instances returns a string with a language-sensitive representation of the date portion of this date in the local timezone.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Try it\n```javascript\nconst event = new Date(Date.UTC(2012, 11, 20, 3, 0, 0));\nconst options = {\n  weekday: \"long\",\n  year: \"numeric\",\n  month: \"long\",\n  day: \"numeric\",\n};\n\nconsole.log(event.toLocaleDateString(\"de-DE\", options));\n// Expected output (varies according to local timezone): Donnerstag, 20. Dezember 2012\n\nconsole.log(event.toLocaleDateString(\"ar-EG\", options));\n// Expected output (varies according to local timezone): الخميس، ٢٠ ديسمبر، ٢٠١٢\n\nconsole.log(event.toLocaleDateString(undefined, options));\n// Expected output (varies according to local timezone and default locale): Thursday, December 20, 2012\n```\n\n## Syntax\n```javascript\ntoLocaleDateString()\ntoLocaleDateString(locales)\ntoLocaleDateString(locales, options)\n```\n\n## Parameters\nThe `locales` and `options` parameters customize the behavior of the function and let applications specify the language whose formatting conventions should be used.\n\nIn implementations that support the [`Intl.DateTimeFormat` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat), these parameters correspond exactly to the [`Intl.DateTimeFormat()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat/DateTimeFormat) constructor's parameters. Implementations without `Intl.DateTimeFormat` support are asked to ignore both parameters, making the locale used and the form of the string returned entirely implementation-dependent.\n\n[`locales` Optional](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toLocaleDateString#locales)\nA string with a BCP 47 language tag, or an array of such strings. Corresponds to the [`locales`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat/DateTimeFormat#locales) parameter of the `Intl.DateTimeFormat()` constructor.\n\nIn implementations without `Intl.DateTimeFormat` support, this parameter is ignored and the host's locale is usually used.\n\n[`options` Optional](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toLocaleDateString#options)\nAn object adjusting the output format. Corresponds to the [`options`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat/DateTimeFormat#options) parameter of the `Intl.DateTimeFormat()` constructor. The `timeStyle` option must be undefined, or a [`TypeError`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypeError) would be thrown. If `weekday`, `year`, `month`, and `day` are all undefined, then `year`, `month`, and `day` will be set to `\"numeric\"`.\n\nIn implementations without `Intl.DateTimeFormat` support, this parameter is ignored.\n\nSee the [`Intl.DateTimeFormat()` constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat/DateTimeFormat) for details on these parameters and how to use them.\n\n## Return value\nA string representing the date portion of the given date according to language-specific conventions.\n\nIn implementations with `Intl.DateTimeFormat`, this is equivalent to `new Intl.DateTimeFormat(locales, options).format(date)`, where `options` has been normalized as described above.\n\n**Note:** Most of the time, the formatting returned by `toLocaleDateString()` is consistent. However, the output may vary between implementations, even within the same locale — output variations are by design and allowed by the specification. It may also not be what you expect. For example, the string may use non-breaking spaces or be surrounded by bidirectional control characters. You should not compare the results of `toLocaleDateString()` to hardcoded constants.\n\n## Examples\n### Using toLocaleDateString()\nBasic use of this method without specifying a `locale` returns a formatted string in the default locale and with default options.\n\n```javascript\nconst date = new Date(Date.UTC(2012, 11, 12, 3, 0, 0));\n\n// toLocaleDateString() without arguments depends on the implementation,\n// the default locale, and the default time zone\nconsole.log(date.toLocaleDateString());\n// \"12/11/2012\" if run in en-US locale with time zone America/Los_Angeles\n```\n\n### Checking for support for locales and options parameters\nThe `locales` and `options` parameters may not be supported in all implementations, because support for the internationalization API is optional, and some systems may not have the necessary data. For implementations without internationalization support, `toLocaleDateString()` always uses the system's locale, which may not be what you want. Because any implementation that supports the `locales` and `options` parameters must support the [`Intl`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl) API, you can check the existence of the latter for support:\n\n```javascript\nfunction toLocaleDateStringSupportsLocales() {\n  return (\n    typeof Intl === \"object\" &&\n    !!Intl &&\n    typeof Intl.DateTimeFormat === \"function\"\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Using locales\nThis example shows some of the variations in localized date formats. In order to get the format of the language used in the user interface of your application, make sure to specify that language (and possibly some fallback languages) using the `locales` argument:\n\n```javascript\nconst date = new Date(Date.UTC(2012, 11, 20, 3, 0, 0));\n\n// formats below assume the local time zone of the locale;\n// America/Los_Angeles for the US\n\n// US English uses month-day-year order\nconsole.log(date.toLocaleDateString(\"en-US\"));\n// \"12/20/2012\"\n\n// British English uses day-month-year order\nconsole.log(date.toLocaleDateString(\"en-GB\"));\n// \"20/12/2012\"\n\n// Korean uses year-month-day order\nconsole.log(date.toLocaleDateString(\"ko-KR\"));\n// \"2012. 12. 20.\"\n\n// Event for Persian, It's hard to manually convert date to Solar Hijri\nconsole.log(date.toLocaleDateString(\"fa-IR\"));\n// \"۱۳۹۱/۹/۳۰\"\n\n// Arabic in most Arabic speaking countries uses real Arabic digits\nconsole.log(date.toLocaleDateString(\"ar-EG\"));\n// \"٢٠‏/١٢‏/٢٠١٢\"\n\n// for Japanese, applications may want to use the Japanese calendar,\n// where 2012 was the year 24 of the Heisei era\nconsole.log(date.toLocaleDateString(\"ja-JP-u-ca-japanese\"));\n// \"24/12/20\"\n\n// when requesting a language that may not be supported, such as\n// Balinese, include a fallback language, in this case Indonesian\nconsole.log(date.toLocaleDateString([\"ban\", \"id\"]));\n// \"20/12/2012\"\n```\n\n### Using options\nThe results provided by `toLocaleDateString()` can be customized using the `options` parameter:\n\n```javascript\nconst date = new Date(Date.UTC(2012, 11, 20, 3, 0, 0));\n\n// Request a weekday along with a long date\nconst options = {\n  weekday: \"long\",\n  year: \"numeric\",\n  month: \"long\",\n  day: \"numeric\",\n};\nconsole.log(date.toLocaleDateString(\"de-DE\", options));\n// \"Donnerstag, 20. Dezember 2012\"\n\n// An application may want to use UTC and make that visible\noptions.timeZone = \"UTC\";\noptions.timeZoneName = \"short\";\nconsole.log(date.toLocaleDateString(\"en-US\", options));\n// \"Thursday, December 20, 2012, UTC\"\n```\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [ECMAScript® 2025 Language Specification<br># sec-date.prototype.tolocaledatestring](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/numbers-and-dates.html#sec-date.prototype.tolocaledatestring) |\n| [ECMAScript® 2025 Internationalization API Specification<br># sup-date.prototype.tolocaledatestring](https://tc39.es/ecma402/#sup-date.prototype.tolocaledatestring) |\n\n## Browser compatibility\n\n\n## See also\n- [`Intl.DateTimeFormat`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat)\n- [`Date.prototype.toLocaleString()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toLocaleString)\n- [`Date.prototype.toLocaleTimeString()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toLocaleTimeString)\n- [`Date.prototype.toString()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toString)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toLocaleDateString", "title": "Date.prototype.toLocaleDateString()", "description": "The toLocaleDateString() method of Date instances returns a string with a language-sensitive representation of the date portion of this date in the local timezone.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 8, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 03:00:19", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:image:width": "1920", "og:type": "website", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "language": "en-US", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toLocaleDateString", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "description": "The toLocaleDateString() method of Date instances returns a string with a language-sensitive representation of the date portion of this date in the local timezone.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Array.prototype.flat()\"?\n\nAssistant: The flat() method of Array instances creates a new array with all sub-array elements concatenated into it recursively up to the specified depth.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Try it\n```javascript\nconst arr1 = [0, 1, 2, [3, 4]];\n\nconsole.log(arr1.flat());\n// expected output: Array [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n\nconst arr2 = [0, 1, [2, [3, [4, 5]]]];\n\nconsole.log(arr2.flat());\n// expected output: Array [0, 1, 2, Array [3, Array [4, 5]]]\n\nconsole.log(arr2.flat(2));\n// expected output: Array [0, 1, 2, 3, Array [4, 5]]\n\nconsole.log(arr2.flat(Infinity));\n// expected output: Array [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n```\n\n## Syntax\n```javascript\nflat()\nflat(depth)\n```\n\n## Parameters\n`depth` Optional\nThe depth level specifying how deep a nested array structure should be flattened. Defaults to 1.\n\n## Return value\nA new array with the sub-array elements concatenated into it.\n\n## Description\nThe flat() method is a copying method. It does not alter this but instead returns a shallow copy that contains the same elements as the ones from the original array.\n\nThe flat() method removes empty slots if the array being flattened is sparse. For example, if depth is 1, both empty slots in the root array and in the first level of nested arrays are ignored, but empty slots in further nested arrays are preserved with the arrays themselves.\n\nThe flat() method is generic. It only expects the this value to have a length property and integer-keyed properties. However, its elements must be arrays if they are to be flattened.\n\n## Examples\n### Flattening nested arrays\n```javascript\nconst arr1 = [1, 2, [3, 4]];\narr1.flat();\n// [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\nconst arr2 = [1, 2, [3, 4, [5, 6]]];\narr2.flat();\n// [1, 2, 3, 4, [5, 6]]\n\nconst arr3 = [1, 2, [3, 4, [5, 6]]];\narr3.flat(2);\n// [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n\nconst arr4 = [1, 2, [3, 4, [5, 6, [7, 8, [9, 10]]]]];\narr4.flat(Infinity);\n// [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n```\n\n### Using flat() on sparse arrays\nThe flat() method removes empty slots in arrays:\n```javascript\nconst arr5 = [1, 2, , 4, 5];\nconsole.log(arr5.flat()); // [1, 2, 4, 5]\n\nconst array = [1, , 3, [\"a\", , \"c\"]];\nconsole.log(array.flat()); // [ 1, 3, \"a\", \"c\" ]\n\nconst array2 = [1, , 3, undefined, [\"a\", , [\"d\", , \"e\"]], null];\nconsole.log(array2.flat()); // [ 1, 3, undefined, \"a\", [\"d\", empty, \"e\"], null ]\nconsole.log(array2.flat(2)); // [ 1, 3, undefined, \"a\", \"d\", \"e\", null ]\n```\n\n### Calling flat() on non-array objects\nThe flat() method reads the length property of this and then accesses each property whose key is a nonnegative integer less than length. If the element is not an array, it's directly appended to the result. If the element is an array, it's flattened according to the depth parameter.\n```javascript\nconst arrayLike = {\n  length: 3,\n  0: [1, 2],\n  // Array-like objects aren't flattened\n  1: { length: 2, 0: 3, 1: 4 },\n  2: 5,\n  3: 3, // ignored by flat() since length is 3\n};\nconsole.log(Array.prototype.flat.call(arrayLike));\n// [ 1, 2, { '0': 3, '1': 4, length: 2 }, 5 ]\n```\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [ECMAScript® 2025 Language Specification<br># sec-array.prototype.flat](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/indexed-collections.html#sec-array.prototype.flat) |\n\n## Browser compatibility\n|  | desktop | mobile | server |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Chrome | Edge | Firefox | Opera | Safari | Chrome Android | Firefox for Android | Opera Android | Safari on iOS | Samsung Internet | WebView Android | WebView on iOS | Deno | Node.js |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `flat` | Chrome – Full support<br>Chrome69<br>Toggle history | Edge – Full support<br>Edge79<br>Toggle history | Firefox – Full support<br>Firefox62<br>Toggle history | Opera – Full support<br>Opera56<br>Toggle history | Safari – Full support<br>Safari12<br>Toggle history | Chrome Android – Full support<br>Chrome Android69<br>Toggle history | Firefox for Android – Full support<br>Firefox for Android62<br>Toggle history | Opera Android – Full support<br>Opera Android48<br>Toggle history | Safari on iOS – Full support<br>Safari on iOS12<br>Toggle history | Samsung Internet – Full support<br>Samsung Internet10.0<br>Toggle history | WebView Android – Full support<br>WebView Android69<br>Toggle history | WebView on iOS – Full support<br>WebView on iOS12<br>Toggle history | Deno – Full support<br>Deno1.0<br>Toggle history | Node.js – Full support<br>Node.js11.0.0<br>Toggle history |\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/flat", "title": "Array.prototype.flat()", "description": "The flat() method of Array instances creates a new array with all sub-array elements concatenated into it recursively up to the specified depth.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 8, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 03:00:51", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:description": "The flat() method of Array instances creates a new array with all sub-array\nelements concatenated into it recursively up to the specified depth.", "language": "en-US", "og:type": "website", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "position": ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6"], "ogDescription": "The flat() method of Array instances creates a new array with all sub-array\nelements concatenated into it recursively up to the specified depth.", "og:image:type": "image/png", "description": "The flat() method of Array instances creates a new array with all sub-array\nelements concatenated into it recursively up to the specified depth.", "title": "Array.prototype.flat() - JavaScript | MDN", "ogTitle": "Array.prototype.flat() - JavaScript | MDN", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "og:image:width": "1920", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "og:locale": "en_US", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "ogLocale": "en_US", "og:title": "Array.prototype.flat() - JavaScript | MDN", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/flat", "og:image:height": "1080", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/flat", "scrapeId": "8aa2f948-1867-478d-ab39-7cc10b0d1a50", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/flat", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/flat", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Array.prototype.join()\"?\n\nAssistant: The `join()` method of Array instances creates and returns a new string by concatenating all of the elements in this array, separated by commas or a specified separator string.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Try it\n```javascript\nconst elements = [\"Fire\", \"Air\", \"Water\"];\n\nconsole.log(elements.join());\n// Expected output: \"Fire,Air,Water\"\n\nconsole.log(elements.join(\"\"));\n// Expected output: \"FireAirWater\"\n\nconsole.log(elements.join(\"-\"));\n// Expected output: \"Fire-Air-Water\"\n```\n\n## Syntax\n```javascript\njoin()\njoin(separator)\n```\n\n## Parameters\n`separator` Optional\n\nA string to separate each pair of adjacent elements of the array. If omitted, the array elements are separated with a comma (\",\").\n\n## Return value\nA string with all array elements joined. If `array.length` is `0`, the empty string is returned.\n\n## Description\nThe string conversions of all array elements are joined into one string. If an element is `undefined` or `null`, it is converted to an empty string instead of the string \"null\" or \"undefined\".\n\nThe `join` method is accessed internally by `Array.prototype.toString()` with no arguments. Overriding `join` of an array instance will override its `toString` behavior as well.\n\n`Array.prototype.join` recursively converts each element, including other arrays, to strings. Because the string returned by `Array.prototype.toString` (which is the same as calling `join()`) does not have delimiters, nested arrays look like they are flattened. You can only control the separator of the first level, while deeper levels always use the default comma.\n\n## Examples\n### Joining an array four different ways\nThe following example creates an array, `a`, with three elements, then joins the array four times: using the default separator, then a comma and a space, then a plus and an empty string.\n\n```javascript\nconst a = [\"Wind\", \"Water\", \"Fire\"];\na.join(); // 'Wind,Water,Fire'\na.join(\", \"); // 'Wind, Water, Fire'\na.join(\" + \"); // 'Wind + Water + Fire'\na.join(\"\"); // 'WindWaterFire'\n```\n\n### Using join() on sparse arrays\n`join()` treats empty slots the same as `undefined` and produces an extra separator:\n\n```javascript\nconsole.log([1, , 3].join()); // '1,,3'\nconsole.log([1, undefined, 3].join()); // '1,,3'\n```\n\n### Calling join() on non-array objects\nThe `join()` method reads the `length` property of `this` and then accesses each property whose key is a nonnegative integer less than `length`.\n\n```javascript\nconst arrayLike = {\n  length: 3,\n  0: 2,\n  1: 3,\n  2: 4,\n  3: 5, // ignored by join() since length is 3\n};\nconsole.log(Array.prototype.join.call(arrayLike));\n// 2,3,4\nconsole.log(Array.prototype.join.call(arrayLike, \".\"));\n// 2.3.4\n```\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/join", "title": "Array.prototype.join()", "description": "The `join()` method of Array instances creates and returns a new string by concatenating all of the elements in this array, separated by commas or a specified separator string.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 6, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 03:01:15", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:image:height": "1080", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "og:type": "website", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:title": "Array.prototype.join() - JavaScript | MDN", "ogTitle": "Array.prototype.join() - JavaScript | MDN", "description": "The join() method of Array instances creates and\nreturns a new string by concatenating all of the elements in this array,\nseparated by commas or a specified separator string.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Promise.all()\"?\n\nAssistant: The `Promise.all()` static method takes an iterable of promises as input and returns a single Promise. This returned promise fulfills when all of the input's promises fulfill, with an array of the fulfillment values. It rejects when any of the input's promises rejects, with this first rejection reason.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Try it\n```javascript\nconst promise1 = Promise.resolve(3);\nconst promise2 = 42;\npromise3 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n  setTimeout(resolve, 100, \"foo\");\n});\n\nPromise.all([promise1, promise2, promise3]).then((values) => {\n  console.log(values);\n});\n// Expected output: Array [3, 42, \"foo\"]\n```\n\n## Syntax\n```javascript\nPromise.all(iterable)\n```\n\n## Parameters\n`iterable`\n\nAn iterable (such as an `Array`) of promises.\n\n## Return value\nA `Promise` that is:\n\n- **Already fulfilled**, if the `iterable` passed is empty.\n- **Asynchronously fulfilled**, when all the promises in the given `iterable` fulfill. The fulfillment value is an array of fulfillment values, in the order of the promises passed, regardless of completion order. If the `iterable` passed is non-empty but contains no pending promises, the returned promise is still asynchronously fulfilled.\n- **Asynchronously rejected**, when any of the promises in the given `iterable` rejects. The rejection reason is the rejection reason of the first promise that was rejected.\n\n## Description\nThe `Promise.all()` method is one of the promise concurrency methods. It can be useful for aggregating the results of multiple promises. It is typically used when there are multiple related asynchronous tasks that the overall code relies on to work successfully — all of whom we want to fulfill before the code execution continues.\n\n`Promise.all()` will reject immediately upon **any** of the input promises rejecting. In comparison, the promise returned by `Promise.allSettled()` will wait for all input promises to complete, regardless of whether or not one rejects. Use `allSettled()` if you need the final result of every promise in the input iterable.\n\n## Examples\n### Using Promise.all()\n\n`Promise.all` waits for all fulfillments (or the first rejection).\n\n```javascript\nconst p1 = Promise.resolve(3);\nconst p2 = 1337;\nconst p3 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n  setTimeout(() => {\n    resolve(\"foo\");\n  }, 100);\n});\n\nPromise.all([p1, p2, p3]).then((values) => {\n  console.log(values); // [3, 1337, \"foo\"]\n});\n```\n\nIf the `iterable` contains non-promise values, they will be ignored, but still counted in the returned promise array value (if the promise is fulfilled):\n\n```javascript\n// All values are non-promises, so the returned promise gets fulfilled\nconst p = Promise.all([1, 2, 3]);\n// The only input promise is already fulfilled,\n// so the returned promise gets fulfilled\nconst p2 = Promise.all([1, 2, 3, Promise.resolve(444)]);\n// One (and the only) input promise is rejected,\n// so the returned promise gets rejected\nconst p3 = Promise.all([1, 2, 3, Promise.reject(555)]);\n\n// Using setTimeout, we can execute code after the queue is empty\nsetTimeout(() => {\n  console.log(p);\n  console.log(p2);\n  console.log(p3);\n});\n\n// Logs:\n// Promise { <state>: \"fulfilled\", <value>: Array[3] }\n// Promise { <state>: \"fulfilled\", <value>: Array[4] }\n// Promise { <state>: \"rejected\", <reason>: 555 }\n```\n\n### Asynchronicity or synchronicity of Promise.all\n\nThis following example demonstrates the asynchronicity of `Promise.all` when a non-empty `iterable` is passed:\n\n```javascript\n// Passing an array of promises that are already resolved,\n// to trigger Promise.all as soon as possible\nconst resolvedPromisesArray = [Promise.resolve(33), Promise.resolve(44)];\n\nconst p = Promise.all(resolvedPromisesArray);\n// Immediately logging the value of p\nconsole.log(p);\n\n// Using setTimeout, we can execute code after the queue is empty\nsetTimeout(() => {\n  console.log(\"the queue is now empty\");\n  console.log(p);\n});\n\n// Logs, in order:\n// Promise { <state>: \"pending\" }\n// the queue is now empty\n// Promise { <state>: \"fulfilled\", <value>: Array[2] }\n```\n\nThe same thing happens if `Promise.all` rejects:\n\n```javascript\nconst mixedPromisesArray = [Promise.resolve(33), Promise.reject(44)];\nconst p = Promise.all(mixedPromisesArray);\nconsole.log(p);\nsetTimeout(() => {\n  console.log(\"the queue is now empty\");\n  console.log(p);\n});\n\n// Logs:\n// Promise { <state>: \"pending\" }\n// the queue is now empty\n// Promise { <state>: \"rejected\", <reason>: 44 }\n```\n\n`Promise.all` resolves synchronously if and only if the `iterable` passed is empty:\n\n```javascript\nconst p = Promise.all([]); // Will be immediately resolved\nconst p2 = Promise.all([1337, \"hi\"]); // Non-promise values are ignored, but the evaluation is done asynchronously\nconsole.log(p);\nconsole.log(p2);\nsetTimeout(() => {\n  console.log(\"the queue is now empty\");\n  console.log(p2);\n});\n\n// Logs:\n// Promise { <state>: \"fulfilled\", <value>: Array[0] }\n// Promise { <state>: \"pending\" }\n// the queue is now empty\n// Promise { <state>: \"fulfilled\", <value>: Array[2] }\n```\n\n### Using Promise.all() with async functions\n\nWithin async functions, it's very common to \"over-await\" your code. For example, given the following functions:\n\n```javascript\nfunction promptForDishChoice() {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    const dialog = document.createElement(\"dialog\");\n    dialog.innerHTML = `\n<form method=\"dialog\">\n  <p>What would you like to eat?</p>\n  <select>\n    <option value=\"pizza\">Pizza</option>\n    <option value=\"pasta\">Pasta</option>\n    <option value=\"salad\">Salad</option>\n  </select>\n  <menu>\n    <li><button value=\"cancel\">Cancel</button></li>\n    <li><button type=\"submit\" value=\"ok\">OK</button></li>\n  </menu>\n</form>\n    `;\n    dialog.addEventListener(\"close\", () => {\n      if (dialog.returnValue === \"ok\") {\n        resolve(dialog.querySelector(\"select\").value);\n      } else {\n        reject(new Error(\"User cancelled dialog\"));\n      }\n    });\n    document.body.appendChild(dialog);\n    dialog.showModal();\n  });\n}\n\nasync function fetchPrices() {\n  const response = await fetch(\"/prices\");\n  return await response.json();\n}\n```\n\nYou may write a function like this:\n\n```javascript\nasync function getPrice() {\n  const choice = await promptForDishChoice();\n  const prices = await fetchPrices();\n  return prices[choice];\n}\n```\n\nHowever, note that the execution of `promptForDishChoice` and `fetchPrices` don't depend on the result of each other. While the user is choosing their dish, it's fine for the prices to be fetched in the background, but in the code above, the await operator causes the async function to pause until the choice is made, and then again until the prices are fetched. We can use `Promise.all` to run them concurrently, so that the user doesn't have to wait for the prices to be fetched before the result is given:\n\n```javascript\nasync function getPrice() {\n  const [choice, prices] = await Promise.all([\n    promptForDishChoice(),\n    fetchPrices(),\n  ]);\n  return prices[choice];\n}\n```\n\n`Promise.all` is the best choice of concurrency method here, because error handling is intuitive — if any of the promises reject, the result is no longer available, so the whole await expression throws.\n\n`Promise.all` accepts an iterable of promises, so if you are using it to run several async functions concurrently, you need to call the async functions and use the returned promises. Directly passing the functions to `Promise.all` does not work, since they are not promises.\n\n```javascript\nasync function getPrice() {\n  const [choice, prices] = await Promise.all([\n    promptForDishChoice,\n    fetchPrices,\n  ]);\n  // `choice` and `prices` are still the original async functions;\n  // Promise.all() does nothing to non-promises\n}\n```\n\n### Promise.all fail-fast behavior\n\n`Promise.all` is rejected if any of the elements are rejected. For example, if you pass in four promises that resolve after a timeout and one promise that rejects immediately, then `Promise.all` will reject immediately.\n\n```javascript\nconst p1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n  setTimeout(() => resolve(\"one\"), 1000);\n});\nconst p2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n  setTimeout(() => resolve(\"two\"), 2000);\n});\nconst p3 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n  setTimeout(() => resolve(\"three\"), 3000);\n});\nconst p4 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n  setTimeout(() => resolve(\"four\"), 4000);\n});\nconst p5 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n  reject(new Error(\"reject\"));\n});\n\n// Using .catch:\nPromise.all([p1, p2, p3, p4, p5])\n  .then((values) => {\n    console.log(values);\n  })\n  .catch((error) => {\n    console.error(error.message);\n  });\n\n// Logs:\n// \"reject\"\n```\n\nIt is possible to change this behavior by handling possible rejections:\n\n```javascript\nconst p1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n  setTimeout(() => resolve(\"p1_delayed_resolution\"), 1000);\n});\n\nconst p2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n  reject(new Error(\"p2_immediate_rejection\"));\n});\n\nPromise.all([p1.catch((error) => error), p2.catch((error) => error)]).then(\n  (values) => {\n    console.log(values[0]); // \"p1_delayed_resolution\"\n    console.error(values[1]); // \"Error: p2_immediate_rejection\"\n  },\n);\n```\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [ECMAScript® 2025 Language Specification<br># sec-promise.all](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/control-abstraction-objects.html#sec-promise.all) |\n\n## Browser compatibility\n|  | desktop | mobile | server |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Chrome | Edge | Firefox | Opera | Safari | Chrome Android | Firefox for Android | Opera Android | Safari on iOS | Samsung Internet | WebView Android | WebView on iOS | Deno | Node.js |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `all()` | Chrome – Full support<br>Chrome32<br>Toggle history | Edge – Full support<br>Edge12<br>Toggle history | Firefox – Full support<br>Firefox29<br>Toggle history | Opera – Full support<br>Opera19<br>Toggle history | Safari – Full support<br>Safari8<br>Toggle history | Chrome Android – Full support<br>Chrome Android32<br>Toggle history | Firefox for Android – Full support<br>Firefox for Android29<br>Toggle history | Opera Android – Full support<br>Opera Android19<br>Toggle history | Safari on iOS – Full support<br>Safari on iOS8<br>Toggle history | Samsung Internet – Full support<br>Samsung Internet2.0<br>Toggle history | WebView Android – Full support<br>WebView Android4.4.3<br>Toggle history | WebView on iOS – Full support<br>WebView on iOS8<br>Toggle history | Deno – Full support<br>Deno1.0<br>Toggle history | Node.js – Full support<br>Node.js0.12.0<br>Toggle history |\n\n## See also\n- [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)\n- [`Promise.allSettled()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/allSettled)\n- [`Promise.any()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/any)\n- [`Promise.race()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/race)\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all", "title": "Promise.all()", "description": "The `Promise.all()` static method takes an iterable of promises as input and returns a single Promise.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"@media prefers-color-scheme\"?\n\nAssistant: The prefers-color-scheme CSS media feature is used to detect if a user has requested light or dark color themes.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Embedded elements\nFor SVG and iframes, prefers-color-scheme lets you set a CSS style for the SVG or iframe based on the color-scheme of the parent element in the web page. SVGs must be used embedded (i.e., <img src=\"circle.svg\" alt=\"circle\" />) as opposed to inlined in HTML. An example of using prefers-color-scheme in SVGs can be found in the \"Inherited color scheme in embedded elements\" section.\n\nUsing prefers-color-scheme is allowed in cross-origin <svg> and <iframe> elements. Cross-origin elements are elements retrieved from a different host than the page that is referencing them. To learn more about SVGs, see the SVG documentation and for more information about iframes, see the iframe documentation.\n\n## Syntax\nlight\n\nIndicates that user has notified that they prefer an interface that has a light theme, or has not expressed an active preference.\n\ndark\n\nIndicates that user has notified that they prefer an interface that has a dark theme.\n\n## Examples\nDetecting a dark or light theme\n\nA common usage is to use a light color scheme by default, and then use prefers-color-scheme: dark to override the colors to a darker variant. It is also possible to do it the other way around.\n\nThis example shows both options: Theme A uses light colors, but can be overridden to dark colors. Theme B uses dark colors, but can be overridden to light colors. In the end, if the browser supports prefers-color-scheme, both themes will be light or dark.\n\nHTML\n\n<div class=\"box theme-a\">Theme A (initial)</div>\n<div class=\"box theme-a adaptive\">Theme A (changed if dark preferred)</div>\n<br />\n<div class=\"box theme-b\">Theme B (initial)</div>\n<div class=\"box theme-b adaptive\">Theme B (changed if light preferred)</div>\n\nCSS\n\ndiv.box {\n  display: inline-block;\n  padding: 1em;\n  margin: 6px;\n  outline: 2px solid #000;\n  width: 12em;\n  height: 2em;\n  vertical-align: middle;\n}\n\nTheme A (brown) uses a light color scheme by default, but will switch to a dark scheme based on the media query:\n\n.theme-a {\n  background: #dca;\n  color: #731;\n}\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n  .theme-a.adaptive {\n    background: #753;\n    color: #dcb;\n    outline: 5px dashed #000;\n  }\n}\n\nTheme B (blue) uses a dark color scheme by default, but will switch to a light scheme based on the media query:\n\n.theme-b {\n  background: #447;\n  color: #bbd;\n}\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: light) {\n  .theme-b.adaptive {\n    background: #bcd;\n    color: #334;\n    outline: 5px dotted #000;\n  }\n}\n\nResult\n\nThe left boxes shows Theme A and Theme B as they would appear without the prefers-color-scheme media query. The right boxes show the same themes, but one of them will be changed to a darker or lighter variant based on the user's active color scheme. The outline of one box will be dashed or dotted if it was changed based on your browser or operating systems settings.\n\n## Inherited color scheme in embedded elements\nThe following example shows how to use the prefers-color-scheme media feature in an embedded element to inherit a color scheme from a parent element. A script is used to set the source of the <img> elements and their alt attributes. This would normally be done in HTML as <img src=\"circle.svg\" alt=\"circle\" />.\n\nYou should see three circles, with one drawn in a different color. The first circle inherits the color-scheme from the OS and can be toggled using the system OS's theme switcher.\n\nThe second and third circles inherit the color-scheme from the embedding element; the @media query allows setting styles of the SVG content based on the parent element's color-scheme. In this case, the parent element with a color-scheme CSS property is a <div>.\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [Media Queries Level 5<br># prefers-color-scheme](https://drafts.csswg.org/mediaqueries-5/#prefers-color-scheme) |\n\n## Browser compatibility\n|  | desktop | mobile |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Chrome | Edge | Firefox | Opera | Safari | Chrome Android | Firefox for Android | Opera Android | Safari on iOS | Samsung Internet | WebView Android | WebView on iOS |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| prefers-color-scheme media feature | Chrome – Full support<br>Chrome76<br>Toggle history | Edge – Full support<br>Edge79<br>Toggle history | Firefox – Full support<br>Firefox67<br>Toggle history | Opera – Full support<br>Opera62<br>Toggle history | Safari – Full support<br>Safari12.1<br>Toggle history | Chrome Android – Full support<br>Chrome Android76<br>Toggle history | Firefox for Android – Full support<br>Firefox for Android67<br>Toggle history | Opera Android – Full support<br>Opera Android54<br>Toggle history | Safari on iOS – Full support<br>Safari on iOS13<br>Toggle history | Samsung Internet – Full support<br>Samsung Internet14.2<br>Toggle history | WebView Android – Full support<br>WebView Android76<br>Toggle history | WebView on iOS – Full support<br>WebView on iOS13<br>Toggle history |\n| no-preference value<br>DeprecatedNon-standard | Chrome – No support<br>Chrome76 – 79<br>Toggle history | Edge – No support<br>Edge79 – 79<br>Toggle history | Firefox – No support<br>Firefox67 – 78<br>Toggle history | Opera – No support<br>Opera62 – 70<br>Toggle history | Safari – No support<br>Safari12.1 – 14.1<br>Toggle history | Chrome Android – No support<br>Chrome Android76 – 79<br>Toggle history | Firefox for Android – No support<br>Firefox for Android67 – 68<br>Toggle history | Opera Android – Full support<br>Opera Android54<br>Toggle history | Safari on iOS – No support<br>Safari on iOS13 – 14.5<br>Toggle history | Samsung Internet – Full support<br>Samsung Internet14.2<br>Toggle history | WebView Android – No support<br>WebView Android76 – 79<br>Toggle history | WebView on iOS – No support<br>WebView on iOS13 – 14.5<br>Toggle history |\n| Respects color-scheme inherited from parent<br>Non-standard | Chrome – Full support<br>Chrome129<br>more<br>Toggle history | Edge – Full support<br>Edge129<br>more<br>Toggle history | Firefox – Full support<br>Firefox105<br>Toggle history | Opera – Full support<br>Opera115<br>more<br>Toggle history | Safari – No support<br>SafariNo<br>Toggle history | Chrome Android – Full support<br>Chrome Android129<br>more<br>Toggle history | Firefox for Android – Full support<br>Firefox for Android105<br>Toggle history | Opera Android – Full support<br>Opera Android86<br>more<br>Toggle history | Safari on iOS – No support<br>Safari on iOSNo<br>Toggle history | Samsung Internet – Partial support<br>Samsung Internet22.0<br>Toggle history | WebView Android – Full support<br>WebView Android129<br>more<br>Toggle history | WebView on iOS – No support<br>WebView on iOSNo<br>Toggle history |\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme", "title": "@media prefers-color-scheme", "description": "The prefers-color-scheme CSS media feature is used to detect if a user has requested light or dark color themes.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 6, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 03:03:25", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme", "ogTitle": "prefers-color-scheme -

May be either a declaration with `const`, `let`, or `var`, or an assignment target.\n- `object`: Object whose non-symbol enumerable properties are iterated over.\n- `statement`: A statement to be executed on every iteration.\n\n## Description\nThe loop will iterate over all enumerable properties of the object itself and those the object inherits from its prototype chain.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"try...catch\"?\n\nAssistant: The `try...catch` statement is comprised of a `try` block and either a `catch` block, a `finally` block, or both. The code in the `try` block is executed first, and if it throws an exception, the code in the `catch` block will be executed. The code in the `finally` block will always be executed before control flow exits the entire construct.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Try it\n```javascript\ntry {\n  nonExistentFunction();\n} catch (error) {\n  console.error(error);\n  // Expected output: ReferenceError: nonExistentFunction is not defined\n  // (Note: the exact output may be browser-dependent)\n}\n```\n\n## Syntax\n```javascript\ntry {\n  tryStatements\n} catch (exceptionVar) {\n  catchStatements\n} finally {\n  finallyStatements\n}\n```\n\n## Description\nThe `try` statement always starts with a `try` block. Then, a `catch` block or a `finally` block must be present. It's also possible to have both `catch` and `finally` blocks. This gives us three forms for the `try` statement:\n\n- `try...catch`\n- `try...finally`\n- `try...catch...finally`\n\nUnlike other constructs such as `if` or `for`, the `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks must be _blocks_, instead of single statements.\n\n```javascript\ntry doSomething(); // SyntaxError\ncatch (e) console.log(e);\n```\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch", "title": "try...catch", "description": "The `try...catch` statement is comprised of a `try` block and either a `catch` block, a `finally` block, or both.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"for await...of\"?\n\nAssistant: The `for await...of` statement creates a loop iterating over async iterable objects as well as sync iterables. This statement can only be used in contexts where `await` can be used, which includes inside an async function body and in a module.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Try it\n```javascript\nasync function* foo() {\n  yield 1;\n  yield 2;\n}\n\n(async function () {\n  for await (const num of foo()) {\n    console.log(num);\n    // Expected output: 1\n\n    break; // Closes iterator, triggers return\n  }\n})();\n```\n\n## Syntax\n```javascript\nfor await (variable of iterable)\n  statement\n```\n\n## Description\nWhen a `for await...of` loop iterates over an iterable, it first gets the iterable's `[Symbol.asyncIterator]()` method and calls it, which returns an async iterator. If the `@asyncIterator` method does not exist, it then looks for an `[Symbol.iterator]()` method, which returns a sync iterator. The sync iterator returned is then wrapped into an async iterator by wrapping every object returned from the `next()`, `return()`, and `throw()` methods into a resolved or rejected promise, with the `value` property resolved if it's also a promise. The loop then repeatedly calls the final async iterator's `next()` method and awaits the returned promise, producing the sequence of values to be assigned to `variable`.\n\nA `for await...of` loop exits when the iterator has completed (the awaited `next()` result is an object with `done: true`). Like other looping statements, you can use control flow statements inside `statement`:\n\n- `break` stops `statement` execution and goes to the first statement after the loop.\n- `continue` stops `statement` execution and goes to the next iteration of the loop.\n\nIf the `for await...of` loop exited early (e.g. a `break` statement is encountered or an error is thrown), the `return()` method of the iterator is called to perform any cleanup. The returned promise is awaited before the loop exits.\n\n`for await...of` generally functions the same as the `for...of` loop and shares many of the same syntax and semantics. There are a few differences:\n\n- `for await...of` works on both sync and async iterables, while `for...of` only works on sync iterables.\n- `for await...of` can only be used in contexts where `await` can be used, which includes inside an async function body and in a module. Even when the iterable is sync, the loop still awaits the return value for every iteration, leading to slower execution due to repeated promise unwrapping.\n- If the iterable is a sync iterable that yields promises, `for await...of` would produce a sequence of resolved values, while `for...of` would produce a sequence of promises. (However, beware of error handling and cleanup.)\n- For `for await...of`, the variable can be the identifier `async` (e.g. `for await (async of foo)`); `for...of` forbids this case.\n\n## Examples\n### Iterating over async iterables\nYou can also iterate over an object that explicitly implements async iterable protocol:\n\n```javascript\nconst LIMIT = 3;\n\nconst asyncIterable = {\n  [Symbol.asyncIterator]() {\n    let i = 0;\n    return {\n      next() {\n        const done = i === LIMIT;\n        const value = done ? undefined : i++;\n        return Promise.resolve({ value, done });\n      },\n      return() {\n        return { done: true };\n      },\n    };\n  },\n};\n\n(async () => {\n  for await (const num of asyncIterable) {\n    console.log(num);\n  }\n})();\n// 0\n// 1\n// 2\n```\n\n### Iterating over async generators\nSince the return values of async generator functions conform to the async iterable protocol, they can be looped using `for await...of`.\n\n```javascript\nasync function* asyncGenerator() {\n  let i = 0;\n  while (i < 3) {\n    yield i++;\n  }\n}\n\n(async () => {\n  for await (const num of asyncGenerator()) {\n    console.log(num);\n  }\n})();\n// 0\n// 1\n// 2\n```\n\nFor a more concrete example of iterating over an async generator using `for await...of`, consider iterating over data from an API.\n\n```javascript\nasync function* streamAsyncIterable(stream) {\n  const reader = stream.getReader();\n  try {\n    while (true) {\n      const { done, value } = await reader.read();\n      if (done) return;\n      yield value;\n    }\n  } finally {\n    reader.releaseLock();\n  }\n}\n\nasync function getResponseSize(url) {\n  const response = await fetch(url);\n  let responseSize = 0;\n  for await (const chunk of streamAsyncIterable(response.body)) {\n    responseSize += chunk.length;\n  }\n  console.log(`Response Size: ${responseSize} bytes`);\n  return responseSize;\n}\ngetResponseSize(\"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos\");\n```\n\n### Iterating over sync iterables and generators\n`for await...of` loop also consumes sync iterables and generators. In that case it internally awaits emitted values before assign them to the loop control variable.\n\n```javascript\nfunction* generator() {\n  yield 0;\n  yield 1;\n  yield Promise.resolve(2);\n  yield Promise.resolve(3);\n  yield 4;\n}\n\n(async () => {\n  for await (const num of generator()) {\n    console.log(num);\n  }\n})();\n// 0\n// 1\n// 2\n// 3\n// 4\n\n// compare with for-of loop:\nfor (const numOrPromise of generator()) {\n  console.log(numOrPromise);\n}\n// 0\n// 1\n// Promise { 2 }\n// Promise { 3 }\n// 4\n```\n\n**Note:** Be aware of yielding rejected promises from a sync generator. In such case, `for await...of` throws when consuming the rejected promise and DOESN'T CALL `finally` blocks within that generator. This can be undesirable if you need to free some allocated resources with `try/finally`.\n\n```javascript\nfunction* generatorWithRejectedPromises() {\n  try {\n    yield 0;\n    yield 1;\n    yield Promise.resolve(2);\n    yield Promise.reject(3);\n    yield 4;\n    throw 5;\n  } finally {\n    console.log(\"called finally\");\n  }\n}\n\n(async () => {\n  try {\n    for await (const num of generatorWithRejectedPromises()) {\n      console.log(num);\n    }\n  } catch (e) {\n    console.log(\"caught\", e);\n  }\n})();\n// 0\n// 1\n// 2\n// caught 3\n\n// compare with for-of loop:\ntry {\n  for (const numOrPromise of generatorWithRejectedPromises()) {\n    console.log(numOrPromise);\n  }\n} catch (e) {\n  console.log(\"caught\", e);\n}\n// 0\n// 1\n// Promise { 2 }\n// Promise { <rejected> 3 }\n// 4\n// caught 5\n// called finally\n```\n\nTo make `finally` blocks of a sync generator always called, use the appropriate form of the loop — `for await...of` for the async generator and `for...of` for the sync one — and await yielded promises explicitly inside the loop.\n\n```javascript\n(async () => {\n  try {\n    for (const numOrPromise of generatorWithRejectedPromises()) {\n      console.log(await numOrPromise);\n    }\n  } catch (e) {\n    console.log(\"caught\", e);\n  }\n})();\n// 0\n// 1\n// 2\n// caught 3\n// called finally\n```\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for-await...of", "title": "for await...of", "description": "The `for await...of` statement creates a loop iterating over async iterable objects as well as sync iterables.

This can be undesirable if you need to free some allocated resources with `try/finally`.\n• To make `finally` blocks of a sync generator always called, use the appropriate form of the loop — `for await...of` for the async generator and `for...of` for the sync one — and await yielded promises explicitly inside the loop.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for-await...of", "title": "for await...of", "description": "The `for await...of` statement creates a loop iterating over async iterable objects as well as sync iterables.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Skip Navigation Links\"?\n\nAssistant: This page provides information about skip navigation links, which allow users to bypass repetitive content and navigate directly to the main content or search functionality.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## What are Skip Navigation Links?\nSkip navigation links are links that allow users to skip over repetitive content on a webpage, such as navigation menus, and jump directly to the main content. This is particularly useful for users who rely on keyboard navigation or screen readers.\n\n## How to Implement Skip Navigation Links\nTo implement skip navigation links, you can add anchor links at the top of your HTML document that point to the main content or search input. For example:\n\n```html\n<a href=\"#main-content\" class=\"skip-link\">Skip to main content</a>\n<a href=\"#search\" class=\"skip-link\">Skip to search</a>\n```\n\nMake sure to provide appropriate IDs in your main content and search input elements:\n\n```html\n<div id=\"main-content\">\n  <!-- Main content goes here -->\n</div>\n<input type=\"text\" id=\"search\" placeholder=\"Search...\">\n```\n\n## Accessibility Considerations\nWhen implementing skip navigation links, ensure that they are visible when focused. You can achieve this with CSS:\n\n```css\n.skip-link {\n  position: absolute;\n  left: -9999px;\n}\n\n.skip-link:focus {\n  left: 0;\n}\n```\n", "metadata": {"source_url":

We pride ourselves with an ethical advertising approach that ensures ads are context-based, free from tracking pixels, and don't involve personal data sharing.\n\nWhile we understand that advertisers rely on attribution to gauge campaign effectiveness, we also find that current methods pose privacy concerns. In line with our vision of protecting user privacy and personal data, Mozilla is part of a working group to develop Interoperable Private Attribution (IPA), a privacy-preserving attribution solution. We aim to enable attribution without tracking, enhancing ad quality and value.\n\nUntil this becomes a reality, we are working with advertising partners who support our privacy goals. For now, that means collaborating without attribution and developing a better way together. Join us in this journey!\n\n## Our offering\nWe collaborate with vetted advertisers who share our vision for web development. We display at most two static ads per page. We offer exclusive opportunities for prominent homepage visibility, providing advertisers a unique way to capture our audience's attention. We are also happy to collaborate on writing and publishing sponsored content on our blog.\n\n## Our audience\nMDN is a go-to resource for over 17 million web developers monthly, providing open-source documentation on CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and Web APIs.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"WebAssembly\"?\n\nAssistant: WebAssembly is a type of code that can be run in modern web browsers — it is a low-level assembly-like language with a compact binary format that runs with near-native performance and provides languages such as C/C++, C# and Rust with a compilation target so that they can run on the web.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## In a Nutshell\nWebAssembly has huge implications for the web platform — it provides a way to run code written in multiple languages on the web at near-native speed, with client apps running on the web that previously couldn't have done so.\n\nWebAssembly is designed to complement and run alongside JavaScript — using the WebAssembly JavaScript APIs, you can load WebAssembly modules into a JavaScript app and share functionality between the two. This allows you to take advantage of WebAssembly's performance and power and JavaScript's expressiveness and flexibility in the same app, even if you don't know how to write WebAssembly code.\n\nAnd what's even better is that it is being developed as a web standard via the W3C WebAssembly Working Group and Community Group with active participation from all major browser vendors.\n\n## Guides\nWebAssembly concepts\n\nGet started by reading the high-level concepts behind WebAssembly — what it is, why it is so useful, how it fits into the web platform (and beyond), and how to use it.\n\nCompiling a New C/C++ Module to WebAssembly\n\nWhen you've written code in C/C++, you can then compile it into Wasm using a tool like Emscripten. Let's look at how it works.\n\nCompiling an Existing C Module to WebAssembly\n\nA core use-case for WebAssembly is to take the existing ecosystem of C libraries and allow developers to use them on the web.\n\nCompiling from Rust to WebAssembly\n\nIf you've written some Rust code, you can compile it into WebAssembly! This tutorial takes you through all you need to know to compile a Rust project to Wasm and use it in an existing web app.\n\nLoading and running WebAssembly code\n\nAfter you have a Wasm module, this article covers how to fetch, compile and instantiate it, combining the WebAssembly JavaScript API with the Fetch or XHR APIs.\n\nUsing the WebAssembly JavaScript API\n\nOnce you've loaded a Wasm module, you'll want to use it. In this article, we show you how to use WebAssembly via the WebAssembly JavaScript API.\n\nExported WebAssembly functions\n\nExported WebAssembly functions are the JavaScript reflections of WebAssembly functions, which allow calling WebAssembly code from JavaScript. This article describes what they are.\n\nUnderstanding WebAssembly text format\n\nThis article explains the Wasm text format. This is the low-level textual representation of a Wasm module shown in browser developer tools when debugging.\n\nConverting WebAssembly text format to Wasm\n\nThis article provides a guide on how to convert a WebAssembly module written in text format into a Wasm binary.\n\n## API reference\nWebAssembly instruction reference\n\nReference documentation with interactive samples for the set of WebAssembly operators.\n\nWebAssembly JavaScript interface\n\nThis object acts as the namespace for all WebAssembly-related functionality.\n\nWebAssembly.Global()\n\nA WebAssembly.Global object represents a global variable instance, accessible from both JavaScript and importable/exportable across one or more WebAssembly.Module instances. This allows dynamic linking of multiple modules.\n\nWebAssembly.Module()\n\nA WebAssembly.Module object contains stateless WebAssembly code that has already been compiled by the browser and can be efficiently shared with Workers, and instantiated multiple times.\n\nWebAssembly.Instance()\n\nA WebAssembly.Instance object is a stateful, executable instance of a Module. Instance objects contain all the Exported WebAssembly functions that allow calling into WebAssembly code from JavaScript.\n\nWebAssembly.compile()\n\nThe WebAssembly.compile() function compiles WebAssembly binary code into a WebAssembly.Module object.\n\nWebAssembly.compileStreaming()\n\nThe WebAssembly.compileStreaming() function compiles a WebAssembly.Module directly from a streamed underlying source.\n\nWebAssembly.instantiate()\n\nThe WebAssembly.instantiate() function allows you to compile and instantiate WebAssembly code.\n\nWebAssembly.instantiateStreaming()\n\nThe WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming() function is the primary API for compiling and instantiating WebAssembly code, returning both a Module and its first Instance.\n\nWebAssembly.validate()\n\nThe WebAssembly.validate() function validates a given typed array of WebAssembly binary code.\n\nWebAssembly.Memory()\n\nA WebAssembly.Memory object is a resizable ArrayBuffer that holds the raw bytes of memory accessed by an Instance.\n\nWebAssembly.Table()\n\nA WebAssembly.Table object is a resizable typed array of opaque values, like function references, that are accessed by an Instance.\n\nWebAssembly.Tag()\n\nThe WebAssembly.Tag object defines a type of WebAssembly exception that can be thrown to/from WebAssembly code.\n\nWebAssembly.Exception()\n\nThe WebAssembly.Exception object represents a runtime exception thrown from WebAssembly to JavaScript, or thrown from JavaScript to a WebAssembly exception handler.\n\nWebAssembly.CompileError()\n\nCreates a new WebAssembly CompileError object.\n\nWebAssembly.LinkError()\n\nCreates a new WebAssembly LinkError object.\n\nWebAssembly.RuntimeError()\n\nCreates a new WebAssembly RuntimeError object.\n\n## Examples\nWASMSobel\n\nSee our webassembly-examples repo for a number of other examples.\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| WebAssembly JavaScript Interface# webassembly-namespace |\n| WebAssembly JavaScript Interface# ref-for-syntax-numtype①⓪ |\n| Unknown specification |\n| Unknown specification |\n| Unknown specification |\n| WebAssembly Core: Garbage Collection# garbage-collection① |\n| Unknown specification |\n| Unknown specification |\n| WebAssembly JavaScript Interface# dom-globaldescriptor-mutable |\n| Unknown specification |\n| Unknown specification |\n| Unknown specification |\n| Unknown specification |\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly", "title": "WebAssembly", "description": "WebAssembly is a type of code that can be run in modern web browsers — it is a low-level assembly-like language with a compact binary format that runs with near-native performance and provides languages such as C/C++, C# and Rust with a compilation target so that they can run on the web.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": false, "section_count": 5, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 03:08:57", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:type": "website", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "og:description": "WebAssembly is a type of code that can be run in modern web browsers — it is a low-level assembly-like language with a compact binary format that runs with near-native performance and provides languages such as C/C++, C# and Rust with a compilation target so that they can run on the web.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Creating effective technical documentation\"?\n\nAssistant: This article provides an overview of the core principles of technical writing and highlights best practices for creating clear and accessible documentation.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Adopt clarity, conciseness, and consistency\nThese three Cs form the core principles of technical writing. They can take you a long way in producing quality documentation.\n\n### Clarity\nFor achieving clarity in your writing, apply the following guidelines:\n\n- Use simple words and clear language. Keep in mind the audience, especially if it includes non-native English speakers.\n- Be clear about who needs to perform the action. Writing in active voice is not strictly required. However, you should use it when you want to be clear about who needs to perform the action. For example, clarify whether a function is triggered by an event or if the user needs to explicitly call the function.\n- Clearly introduce and explain new terms. This helps to lay the foundation for concepts that are covered later in the documentation.\n- To avoid ambiguity, specify pronouns clearly. Replace \"it\", \"this\", and \"these\" with proper nouns if they can refer to more than one thing in the given context.\n- Aim for one idea per sentence to improve readability.\n- Stick to one main idea per paragraph. Each sentence in a paragraph should logically connect to the one before it. Imagine if each sentence in a paragraph was a link in a chain. If you pick up the first link, the other links in the chain should follow, forming a continuous sequence. This is how the sentences should connect to each other, ensuring a seamless flow of a single idea.\n\n### Conciseness\nKeep sentences short. This automatically increases the readability and clarity of your document. It also helps in quick comprehension. Long sentences can be more challenging to understand quickly due to their complex structures.\n\nBased on common readability standards, aim for 15-20 words per sentence.\n\nFor additional insights on sentence length and readability strategies, see Simple sentences (on readabilityguidelines.co.uk) and Popular readability formulas, including the Flesch-Kincaid index, on Wikipedia.\n\n### Consistency\nUse the same terminology throughout your documentation to ensure a seamless reader experience. For example, if you start referring to \"user agents\" as browsers, stick with that term consistently. This avoids confusion that can arise from using words interchangeably, even when they share the same meaning.\n\nAdditionally, maintain consistent word casing and follow a uniform formatting style throughout your documentation. These practices not only enhance readability but also contribute to a professional presentation of your documentation.\n\n## Organize your content for maximum impact\nApply the same principles for organizing your content as you would for organizing your code: spend some time setting a clear goal and thinking about the desired structure for your documentation. Ensure that each subsection contributes to this goal incrementally.\n\n### Start with an introduction\nIn the introduction, first describe the feature you're documenting. Next, set the context by explaining why learning about the feature would be beneficial to the readers. This can include describing real-life scenarios where the feature can be useful. The more relevance you add to the topic, the easier it will be for readers to understand and engage with the content.\n\n### Progress logically\nThe following questions can help you ensure that your content is progressing logically:\n\n- Is your document structured to guide readers from foundational concepts to more advanced ones? Are there sections to introduce the \"what\" to establish a base before delving into the \"why\" and \"how\"? Consider whether the document structure mirrors the natural learning path for the topic. Aligning the document's structure with the natural progression of learning helps readers build their knowledge step-by-step and also enhances the overall learning experience.\n- Are there sufficient how-to guides or examples following the conceptual sections?\n- Consider the flow of the content. Is it following a logical sequence — from one sentence to the next, from one paragraph to the next, and from one section to the next? Does each section logically build on the information presented previously, avoiding abrupt jumps or gaps in the content?\n\nAdditionally, as you work on the draft, always ask yourself:\n\n- What reader questions am I addressing with this sentence?\n- Can I add a simplistic or real-life use case to explain this concept?\n\n## Include examples\nImagine sitting next to someone as you explain the concepts to them. Preempt their questions and address them in your writing. Use this approach to add as many relevant examples as possible.\n\nWhen adding examples, don't restrict yourself to only code; include non-code scenarios to demonstrate a feature's utility. This helps readers understand the concepts better and also caters to different learning styles. Consider providing real-world scenarios or use cases to illustrate how the feature or concept applies in practical situations.\n\n## Optimize the document structure and length\nEvaluate your documentation's structure to ensure it maintains a logical and balanced hierarchy.\n\n- Ensure that each section and subsection has a clear purpose and sufficient content.\n- Look for instances where a main section contains only one subsection (orphan), such as a single H3 section under an H2 section. This indicates that you need to reorganize your content or make some additions.\n- Check if there are lower-level headings such as H4. Too many subsections can be overwhelming for readers, making it difficult for them to grasp the information. In such cases, consider presenting the content as a bulleted list instead to help readers retain the key points more effectively. This approach helps to simplify the hierarchy and also contributes to easier navigation.\n- While there should be sufficient content for each section, pay attention to the overall length. If any section becomes too extensive, it can be overwhelming for readers. Split large sections into multiple logical subsections or restructure the content into new sections and subsections. Grouping content into digestible pieces helps maintain focus and improve navigation for readers.\n\n## Proofread your writing\nOne aspect that cannot be stressed enough is the importance of self-reviewing and proofreading what you've written. Whether you're creating a large document or a short paragraph, this step is crucial.\n\nTaking the time to fully review your work will help you identify sections that don't flow well or can be improved for clarity. During self-review, aim to spot and remove redundancy (repetition of ideas without adding value) and repetitiveness (overuse of words or phrases). These refinements will ensure your documentation is clear and coherent and conveys your ideas as intended.\n\nProofread and then take a break before you review again. Only then submit your work. While spell checkers can flag spelling errors, they might not flag incorrect use of words, such as an unintended use of \"he\" instead of \"the\". It's best to take a break and return with fresh eyes to catch any errors you might have missed. Pay close attention to identify inconsistencies in tone, style, tense, or formatting and make the necessary adjustments.\n\n## Additional tips\nTo improve the clarity and accessibility of your documentation, also keep the following guidelines and tips in mind. To go in-depth into any of the topics, feel free to consult our Writing style guide.\n\n- Bulleted vs numbered lists: Lists, in general, make documentation easier to scan. Use bulleted lists when there is no specific order of the items. Use numbered lists when the steps need to be followed in the specific order. Always include a lead-sentence before beginning a list to provide context.\n- Commas: Use a comma after an introductory clause to improve readability and to clarify the sentence structure. Use a comma to separate items in a list to ensure clarity.\n- Alt text: Always provide an alternative text for the images you add to content. This makes your documentation accessible to people using screen readers. In addition to images, ensure that video and audio files have accompanying descriptive texts.\n- Descriptive link text: Make sure each link text is clear even out of context and clearly indicates where the link leads. Descriptive link texts also help people using screen readers understand the destination of links. For example, use \"Read our writing style guide to learn more\" instead of \"Click here to learn more\".\n- Inclusive language: Make your documentation welcoming to everyone. Strive to use words that respect and acknowledge the diversity of your audience.\n\n## Summary\nThat's it for this article. I hope you found these tips helpful as a quick refresher on technical writing best practices. Remember that learning how to create effective and easy-to-use documentation is an ongoing process. It starts with understanding your audience and the goals of your documentation. By applying these technical writing principles and tips, you'll certainly be able to enhance the clarity and overall quality of your documentation.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/blog/technical-writing", "title": "Creating effective technical documentation", "description": "This article provides an overview of the core principles of technical writing and highlights best practices for creating clear and accessible documentation.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 7, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 03:13:29", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:locale": "en_US", "ogTitle": "Creating effective technical documentation | MDN Blog", "ogDescription": "This article provides an overview of the core components required for creating effective technical documentation.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"HTML Video Element\"?\n\nAssistant: The <video> HTML element embeds a media player which supports video playback into the document. You can use <video> for audio content as well, but the <audio> element may provide a more appropriate user experience.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Try it\n```html\n<video controls width=\"250\">\n  <source src=\"/shared-assets/videos/flower.webm\" type=\"video/webm\" />\n\n  <source src=\"/shared-assets/videos/flower.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" />\n\n  Download the\n  <a href=\"/shared-assets/videos/flower.webm\">WEBM</a>\n  or\n  <a href=\"/shared-assets/videos/flower.mp4\">MP4</a>\n  video.\n</video>\n```\n\n## Attributes\nLike all other HTML elements, this element supports the global attributes.\n\n### autoplay\nA Boolean attribute; if specified, the video automatically begins to play back as soon as it can without stopping to finish loading the data.\n\n**Note:** Modern browsers block audio (or videos with an unmuted audio track) from autoplaying, as sites that automatically play audio can be an unpleasant experience for users. See our autoplay guide for additional information about how to properly use autoplay.\n\nTo disable video autoplay, `autoplay=\"false\"` will not work; the video will autoplay if the attribute is there in the <video> tag at all. To remove autoplay, the attribute needs to be removed altogether.\n\n### controls\nIf this attribute is present, the browser will offer controls to allow the user to control video playback, including volume, seeking, and pause/resume playback.\n\n### controlslist\nThe controlslist attribute, when specified, helps the browser select what controls to show for the video element whenever the browser shows its own set of controls (that is, when the controls attribute is specified). The allowed values are nodownload, nofullscreen and noremoteplayback.\n\n### disablepictureinpicture\nUse the disablepictureinpicture attribute if you want to disable the Picture-In-Picture mode (and the control).\n\n### crossorigin\nThis enumerated attribute indicates whether to use CORS to fetch the related video. CORS-enabled resources can be reused in the <canvas> element without being tainted. The allowed values are:\n\n- anonymous: Sends a cross-origin request without a credential.\n- use-credentials: Sends a cross-origin request with a credential.\n\nWhen not present, the resource is fetched without a CORS request.\n\n### height\nThe height of the video's display area, in CSS pixels (absolute values only; no percentages).\n\n### loop\nA Boolean attribute; if specified, the browser will automatically seek back to the start upon reaching the end of the video.\n\n### muted\nA Boolean attribute that indicates the default audio mute setting contained in the video. If set, the audio will be initially silenced.\n\n### playsinline\nA Boolean attribute indicating that the video is to be played \"inline\", that is, within the element's playback area.\n\n### poster\nA URL for an image to be shown while the video is downloading.\n\n### preload\nThis enumerated attribute is intended to provide a hint to the browser about what the author thinks will lead to the best user experience regarding what content is loaded before the video is played.\n\n### src\nThe URL of the video to embed. This is optional; you may instead use the <source> element within the video block to specify the video to embed.\n\n### width\nThe width of the video's display area, in CSS pixels (absolute values only; no percentages).\n\n## Events\n| Event Name | Fired When |\n| --- | --- |\n| audioprocess | The input buffer of a ScriptProcessorNode is ready to be processed. |\n| canplay | The browser can play the media, but estimates that not enough data has been loaded to play the media up to its end without having to stop for further buffering of content. |\n| canplaythrough | The browser estimates it can play the media up to its end without stopping for content buffering. |\n| complete | The rendering of an OfflineAudioContext is terminated. |\n| durationchange | The duration attribute has been updated. |\n| emptied | The media has become empty; for example, this event is sent if the media has already been loaded (or partially loaded), and the load() method is called to reload it. |\n| ended | Playback has stopped because the end of the media was reached. |\n| error | An error occurred while fetching the media data, or the type of the resource is not a supported media format. |\n| loadeddata | The first frame of the media has finished loading. |\n| loadedmetadata | The metadata has been loaded. |\n| loadstart | Fired when the browser has started to load the resource. |\n| pause | Playback has been paused. |\n| play | Playback has begun. |\n| playing | Playback is ready to start after having been paused or delayed due to lack of data. |\n| progress | Fired periodically as the browser loads a resource. |\n| ratechange | The playback rate has changed. |\n| seeked | A seek operation completed. |\n| seeking | A seek operation began. |\n| stalled | The user agent is trying to fetch media data, but data is unexpectedly not forthcoming. |\n| suspend | Media data loading has been suspended. |\n| timeupdate | The time indicated by the currentTime attribute has been updated. |\n| volumechange | The volume has changed. |\n| waiting | Playback has stopped because of a temporary lack of data.\n\n## Usage notes\nBrowsers don't all support the same video formats; you can provide multiple sources inside nested <source> elements, and the browser will then use the first one it understands.\n\n```html\n<video controls>\n  <source src=\"myVideo.webm\" type=\"video/webm\" />\n  <source src=\"myVideo.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" />\n  <p>\n    Your browser doesn't support HTML video. Here is a\n    <a href=\"myVideo.mp4\" download=\"myVideo.mp4\">link to the video</a> instead.\n  </p>\n</video>\n```\n\nWe offer a substantive and thorough guide to media file types and the guide to the codecs supported for video. Also available is a guide to audio codecs that can be used with them.\n\nOther usage notes:\n- If you don't specify the controls attribute, the video won't include the browser's default controls; you can create your own custom controls using JavaScript and the HTMLMediaElement API.\n- To allow precise control over your video (and audio) content, HTMLMediaElements fire many different events. In addition to providing controllability, these events let you monitor the progress of both download and playback of the media, as well as the playback state and position.\n- You can use the object-position property to adjust the positioning of the video within the element's frame, and the object-fit property to control how the video's size is adjusted to fit within the frame.\n- To show subtitles/captions along with your video, you can use some JavaScript along with the <track> element and the WebVTT format.\n\n## Styling with CSS\nThe <video> element is a replaced element — its display value is inline by default — but its default width and height in the viewport is defined by the video being embedded.\n\nThere are no special considerations for styling <video>; a common strategy is to give it a display value of block to make it easier to position, size, etc., and then provide styling and layout information as required.\n\n## Adding subtitles and other timed text tracks\nTimed text tracks for subtitles, closed captions, chapter headings, and so on, can be added declaratively by nesting the <track> element. The tracks are specified in Web Video Text Tracks File Format (WebVTT) (.vtt files).\n\n```html\n<video controls src=\"video.webm\">\n  <track default kind=\"captions\" src=\"captions.vtt\" />\n</video>\n```\n\n## Detecting track addition and removal\nYou can detect when tracks are added to and removed from a <video> element using the addtrack and removetrack events. However, these events aren't sent directly to the <video> element itself. Instead, they're sent to the track list object within the <video> element's HTMLMediaElement that corresponds to the type of track that was added to the element.\n\n## Server support for video\nIf the MIME type for the video is not set correctly on the server, the video may not show or show a gray box containing an X (if JavaScript is enabled). If you use Apache Web Server to serve WebM videos, you can fix this problem by adding the video file type extensions to the video/webm MIME type.\n\n## Accessibility\nVideos should provide both captions and transcripts that accurately describe their content. Captions allow people who are experiencing hearing loss to understand a video's audio content as the video is being played, while transcripts allow people who need additional time to be able to review audio content at a pace and format that is comfortable for them.\n\n## Examples\n### Single source\nThis example plays a video when activated, providing the user with the browser's default video controls to control playback.\n\n```html\n<video\n  controls\n  src=\"https://archive.org/download/BigBuckBunny_124/Content/big_buck_bunny_720p_surround.mp4\"\n  poster=\"https://peach.blender.org/wp-content/uploads/title_anouncement.jpg?x11217\"\n  width=\"620\">\n  Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos, but don't worry, you can\n  <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/BigBuckBunny_124\">download it</a>\n  and watch it with your favorite video player!\n</video>\n```\n\n### Multiple sources\nThis example builds on the last one, offering three different sources for the media; this allows the video to be watched regardless of which video codecs are supported by the browser.\n\n```html\n<video\n  width=\"620\"\n  controls\n  poster=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Elephants_Dream_s5_both.jpg\">\n  <source\n    src=\"https://archive.org/download/ElephantsDream/ed_hd.avi\"\n    type=\"video/avi\" />\n  <source\n    src=\"https://archive.org/download/ElephantsDream/ed_1024_512kb.mp4\"\n    type=\"video/mp4\" />\n\n  Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos, but don't worry, you can\n  <a\n    href=\"https://archive.org/download/ElephantsDream/ed_1024_512kb.mp4\"\n    download=\"ed_1024_512kb.mp4\">\n    download the MP4\n  </a>\n  and watch it with your favorite video player!\n</video>\n```\n\n## Technical summary\n| Content categories | Flow content, phrasing content, embedded content. If it has a controls attribute: interactive content and palpable content. |\n| Permitted content | If the element has a src attribute: zero or more <track> elements, followed by transparent content that contains no media elements. Else: zero or more <source> elements, followed by zero or more <track> elements, followed by transparent content that contains no media elements. |\n| Tag omission | None, both the starting and ending tag are mandatory. |\n| Permitted parents | Any element that accepts embedded content. |\n| Implicit ARIA role | No corresponding role |\n| Permitted ARIA roles | application |\n| DOM interface | HTMLVideoElement |\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| HTML# the-video-element |\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video", "title": "HTML Video Element", "description": "The <video> HTML element embeds a media player which supports video playback into the document.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"encodeURIComponent()\"?\n\nAssistant: The encodeURIComponent() function encodes a URI by replacing each instance of certain characters by one, two, three, or four escape sequences representing the UTF-8 encoding of the character.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Description\nencodeURIComponent() is a function property of the global object.\n\nencodeURIComponent() uses the same encoding algorithm as described in encodeURI(). It escapes all characters **except**:\n\n```\nA–Z a–z 0–9 - _ . ! ~ * ' ( )\n```\n\nCompared to encodeURI(), encodeURIComponent() escapes a larger set of characters. Use encodeURIComponent() on user-entered fields from forms POST'd to the server — this will encode & symbols that may inadvertently be generated during data entry for character references or other characters that require encoding/decoding. For example, if a user writes Jack & Jill, without encodeURIComponent(), the ampersand could be interpreted on the server as the start of a new field and jeopardize the integrity of the data.\n\nFor application/x-www-form-urlencoded, spaces are to be replaced by +, so one may wish to follow a encodeURIComponent() replacement with an additional replacement of %20 with +.\n\n## Syntax\n```\nencodeURIComponent(uriComponent)\n```\n\n## Parameters\nuriComponent\n\nA string to be encoded as a URI component (a path, query string, fragment, etc.). Other values are converted to strings.\n\n## Return value\nA new string representing the provided uriComponent encoded as a URI component.\n\n## Exceptions\nURIError\n\nThrown if uriComponent contains a lone surrogate.\n\n## Examples\n### Encoding for Content-Disposition and Link headers\n\nThe following example provides the special encoding required within UTF-8 Content-Disposition and Link server response header parameters (e.g., UTF-8 filenames):\n\n```\nconst fileName = \"my file(2).txt\";\nconst header = `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename*=UTF-8''${encodeRFC5987ValueChars(\n  fileName,\n)}`;\n\nconsole.log(header);\n// \"Content-Disposition: attachment; filename*=UTF-8''my%20file%282%29.txt\"\n\nfunction encodeRFC5987ValueChars(str) {\n  return (\n    encodeURIComponent(str)\n      .replace(\n        /['()*]/g,\n        (c) => `%${c.charCodeAt(0).toString(16).toUpperCase()}`,\n      )\n      .replace(/%(7C|60|5E)/g, (str, hex) =>\n        String.fromCharCode(parseInt(hex, 16)),\n      )\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Encoding for RFC3986\n\nThe more recent RFC3986 reserves !, \\' , (, ), and *, even though these characters have no formalized URI delimiting uses. The following function encodes a string for RFC3986-compliant URL component format:\n\n```\nfunction encodeRFC3986URIComponent(str) {\n  return encodeURIComponent(str).replace(\n    /[!'()*]/g,\n    (c) => `%${c.charCodeAt(0).toString(16).toUpperCase()}`,\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Encoding a lone surrogate throws\n\nA URIError will be thrown if one attempts to encode a surrogate which is not part of a high-low pair. For example:\n\n```javascript\n// High-low pair OK\nencodeURIComponent(\"\\uD800\\uDFFF\"); // \"%F0%90%8F%BF\"\n\n// Lone high-surrogate code unit throws \"URIError: malformed URI sequence\"\nencodeURIComponent(\"\\uD800\");\n\n// Lone high-surrogate code unit throws \"URIError: malformed URI sequence\"\nencodeURIComponent(\"\\uDFFF\");\n```\n\n## Specifications\n| Specification |\n| --- |\n| [ECMAScript® 2025 Language Specification<br># sec-encodeuricomponent-uricomponent](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/global-object.html#sec-encodeuricomponent-uricomponent) |\n\n## Browser compatibility\n|  | desktop | mobile | server |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Chrome | Edge | Firefox | Opera | Safari | Chrome Android | Firefox for Android | Opera Android | Safari on iOS | Samsung Internet | WebView Android | WebView on iOS | Deno | Node.js |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `encodeURIComponent` | Chrome – Full support<br>Chrome1<br>Toggle history | Edge – Full support<br>Edge12<br>Toggle history | Firefox – Full support<br>Firefox1<br>Toggle history | Opera – Full support<br>Opera7<br>Toggle history | Safari – Full support<br>Safari1.1<br>Toggle history | Chrome Android – Full support<br>Chrome Android18<br>Toggle history | Firefox for Android – Full support<br>Firefox for Android4<br>Toggle history | Opera Android – Full support<br>Opera Android10.1<br>Toggle history | Safari on iOS – Full support<br>Safari on iOS1<br>Toggle history | Samsung Internet – Full support<br>Samsung Internet1.0<br>Toggle history | WebView Android – Full support<br>WebView Android4.4<br>Toggle history | WebView on iOS – Full support<br>WebView on iOS1<br>Toggle history | Deno – Full support<br>Deno1.0<br>Toggle history | Node.js – Full support<br>Node.js0.10.0<br>Toggle history |\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent", "title": "encodeURIComponent()", "description": "The encodeURIComponent() function encodes a URI by replacing each instance of certain characters by one, two, three, or four escape sequences representing the UTF-8 encoding of the character.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 8, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 03:45:53", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:description": "The encodeURIComponent() function encodes a URI by replacing each instance of certain characters by one, two, three, or four escape sequences representing the UTF-8 encoding of the character (will only be four escape sequences for characters composed of two surrogate characters).

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Web Audio API\"?\n\nAssistant: The Web Audio API provides a powerful and versatile system for controlling audio on the Web, allowing developers to choose audio sources, add effects to audio, create audio visualizations, apply spatial effects (such as panning) and much more.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Web audio concepts and usage\nThe Web Audio API involves handling audio operations inside an audio context, and has been designed to allow modular routing. Basic audio operations are performed with audio nodes, which are linked together to form an audio routing graph. Several sources — with different types of channel layout — are supported even within a single context. This modular design provides the flexibility to create complex audio functions with dynamic effects.\n\nAudio nodes are linked into chains and simple webs by their inputs and outputs. They typically start with one or more sources. Sources provide arrays of sound intensities (samples) at very small timeslices, often tens of thousands of them per second. These could be either computed mathematically (such as [OscillatorNode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/OscillatorNode)), or they can be recordings from sound/video files (like [AudioBufferSourceNode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioBufferSourceNode) and [MediaElementAudioSourceNode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaElementAudioSourceNode)) and audio streams ( [MediaStreamAudioSourceNode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamAudioSourceNode)). In fact, sound files are just recordings of sound intensities themselves, which come in from microphones or electric instruments, and get mixed down into a single, complicated wave.\n\nOutputs of these nodes could be linked to inputs of others, which mix or modify these streams of sound samples into different streams. A common modification is multiplying the samples by a value to make them louder or quieter (as is the case with [GainNode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GainNode)). Once the sound has been sufficiently processed for the intended effect, it can be linked to the input of a destination ( [BaseAudioContext.destination](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/BaseAudioContext/destination)), which sends the sound to the speakers or headphones. This last connection is only necessary if the user is supposed to hear the audio.\n\nA simple, typical workflow for web audio would look something like this:\n\n1. Create audio context\n2. Inside the context, create sources — such as <audio>, oscillator, stream\n3. Create effects nodes, such as reverb, biquad filter, panner, compressor\n4. Choose final destination of audio, for example your system speakers\n5. Connect the sources up to the effects, and the effects to the destination.\n\nTiming is controlled with high precision and low latency, allowing developers to write code that responds accurately to events and is able to target specific samples, even at a high sample rate. So applications such as drum machines and sequencers are well within reach.\n\nThe Web Audio API also allows us to control how audio is spatialized. Using a system based on a source-listener model, it allows control of the panning model and deals with distance-induced attenuation induced by a moving source (or moving listener).\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API", "title": "Web Audio API", "description": "The Web Audio API provides a powerful and versatile system for controlling audio on the Web, allowing developers to choose audio sources, add effects to audio, create audio visualizations, apply spatial effects (such as panning) and much more.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 1, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 04:25:33", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:image:type": "image/png", "theme-color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "language": "en-US", "ogLocale": "en_US", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "og:locale": "en_US", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "og:image:width": "1920", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "ogDescription": "The Web Audio API provides a powerful and versatile system for controlling audio on the Web, allowing developers to choose audio sources, add effects to audio, create audio visualizations, apply spatial effects (such as panning) and much more.", "position": ["1", "2", "3"], "og:image:height": "1080", "title": "Web Audio API - Web APIs | MDN", "og:title": "Web Audio API - Web APIs | MDN", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "description": "The Web Audio API provides a powerful and versatile system for controlling audio on the Web, allowing developers to choose audio sources, add effects to audio, create audio visualizations, apply spatial effects (such as panning) and much more.", "og:type": "website", "ogTitle": "Web Audio API - Web APIs | MDN", "og:description": "The Web Audio API provides a powerful and versatile system for controlling audio on the Web, allowing developers to choose audio sources, add effects to audio, create audio visualizations, apply spatial effects (such as panning) and much more.", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "scrapeId": "cceb9d0f-b365-47f4-9993-d185d8746c74", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful MDN Web Docs expert.\n\nUser: What is \"Responsive images\"?\n\nAssistant: In this article, we'll learn about the concept of responsive images — images that work well on devices with widely differing screen sizes, resolutions, and other such features — and look at what tools HTML provides to help implement them. This helps to improve performance across different devices.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Why responsive images?\nLet's examine a typical scenario. A typical website may contain a header image and some content images below the header. The header image will likely span the whole of the width of the header, and the content image will fit somewhere inside the content column. Here's an example:\n\n![Our example site as viewed on a wide screen - here the first image works OK, as it is big enough to see the detail in the center.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Responsive_images/picture-element-wide.png)\n\nThis works well on a wide screen device, such as a laptop or desktop (you can [see the example live](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/html/multimedia-and-embedding/responsive-images/not-responsive.html) and find the [source code](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/multimedia-and-embedding/responsive-images/not-responsive.html) on GitHub.) We won't discuss the CSS much in this lesson, except to say that:\n\n- The body content has been set to a maximum width of 1200 pixels — in viewports above that width, the body remains at 1200px and centers itself in the available space. In viewports below that width, the body will stay at 100% of the width of the viewport.\n- The header image has been set so that its center always stays in the center of the header, no matter what width the heading is set at. If the site is being viewed on a narrower screen, the important detail in the center of the image (the people) can still be seen, and the excess is lost off either side. It is 200px high.\n- The content images have been set so that if the body element becomes smaller than the image, the images start to shrink so that they always stay inside the body, rather than overflowing it.\n\nHowever, issues arise when you start to view the site on a narrow screen device. The header below looks OK, but it's starting to take up a lot of the screen height for a mobile device. And at this size, it is difficult to see faces of the two people within the first content image.\n\n![Our example site as viewed on a narrow screen; the first image has shrunk to the point where it is hard to make out the detail on it.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Responsive_images/non-responsive-narrow.png)\n\nAn improvement would be to display a cropped version of the image which displays the important details of the image when the site is viewed on a narrow screen. A second cropped image could be displayed for a medium-width screen device, like a tablet. The general problem whereby you want to serve different cropped images in that way, for various layouts, is commonly known as the **art direction problem**.\n\nIn addition, there is no need to embed such large images on the page if it is being viewed on a mobile screen. Doing so can waste bandwidth; in particular, mobile users don't want to waste bandwidth by downloading a large image intended for desktop users, when a small image would do for their device. Conversely, a small [raster image](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Raster_image) starts to look grainy when displayed larger than its original size (a raster image is a set number of pixels wide and a set number of pixels tall). Ideally, multiple resolutions would be made available to the user's web browser. The browser could then determine the optimal resolution to load based on the screen size of the user's device. This is called the **resolution switching problem**.\n\nTo make things more complicated, some devices have high resolution screens that need larger images than you might expect to display nicely. This is essentially the same problem, but in a slightly different context.\n\nYou might think that vector images would solve these problems, and they do to a certain degree — they are small in file size and scale well, and you should use them wherever possible. However, they aren't suitable for all image types. Vector images are great for simple graphics, patterns, interface elements, etc., but it starts to get very complex to create a vector-based image with the kind of detail that you'd find in say, a photo. Raster image formats such as JPEGs are more suited to the kind of images we see in the above example.\n\nThis kind of problem didn't exist when the web first existed, in the early to mid 90s — back then the only devices in existence to browse the Web were desktops and laptops, so browser engineers and spec writers didn't even think to implement solutions. _Responsive image technologies_ were implemented recently to solve the problems indicated above by letting you offer the browser several image files, either all showing the same thing but containing different numbers of pixels ( _resolution switching_), or different images suitable for different space allocations ( _art direction_).\n\n**Note:**\nThe new features discussed in this article — [`srcset`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#srcset)/ [`sizes`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#sizes)/ [`<picture>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture) — are all supported in modern desktop and mobile browsers.\n\n## How do you create responsive images?\nIn this section, we'll look at the two problems illustrated above and show how to solve them using HTML's responsive image features. You should note that we will be focusing on [`<img>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img) elements for this section, as seen in the content area of the example above — the image in the site header is only for decoration, and therefore implemented using CSS background images. [CSS arguably has better tools for responsive design](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/responsive-images-101-part-8-css-images/) than HTML, and we'll talk about those in a future CSS module.\n\n## Resolution switching: Different sizes\nSo, what is the problem that we want to solve with resolution switching? We want to display identical image content, just larger or smaller depending on the device — this is the situation we have with the second content image in our example. The standard [`<img>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img) element traditionally only lets you point the browser to a single source file:\n\n```html\n<img src=\"elva-fairy-800w.jpg\" alt=\"Elva dressed as a fairy\" />\n```\n\nWe can however use two attributes — [`srcset`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#srcset) and [`sizes`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#sizes) — to provide several additional source images along with hints to help the browser pick the right one. You can see an example of this in our [responsive.html](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/html/multimedia-and-embedding/responsive-images/responsive.html) example on GitHub (see also [the source code](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/multimedia-and-embedding/responsive-images/responsive.html)):\n\n```html\n<img\n  srcset=\"elva-fairy-480w.jpg 480w, elva-fairy-800w.jpg 800w\"\n  sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 480px,\n         800px\"\n  src=\"elva-fairy-800w.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Elva dressed as a fairy\" />\n```\n\nThe `srcset` and `sizes` attributes look complicated, but they're not too hard to understand if you format them as shown above, with a different part of the attribute value on each line. Each value contains a comma-separated list, and each part of those lists is made up of three sub-parts. Let's run through the contents of each now:\n\n**`srcset`** defines the set of images we will allow the browser to choose between, and what size each image is. Each set of image information is separated from the previous one by a comma. For each one, we write:\n\n1. An **image filename** ( `elva-fairy-480w.jpg`)\n2. A space\n3. The image's **intrinsic width in pixels** ( `480w`) — note that this uses the `w` unit, not `px` as you might expect. An image's [intrinsic size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Intrinsic_Size) is its real size, which can be found by inspecting the image file on your computer (for example, on a Mac you can select the image in Finder and press `Cmd` \\+ `I` to bring up the info screen).\n\n**`sizes`** defines a set of media conditions (e.g. screen widths) and indicates what image size would be best to choose, when certain media conditions are true — these are the hints we talked about earlier. In this case, before each comma we write:\n\n1. A **media condition** ( `(max-width:600px)`) — you'll learn more about these in the [CSS topic](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics), but for now let's just say that a media condition describes a possible state that the screen can be in. In this case, we are saying \"when the viewport width is 600 pixels or less\".\n2. A space\n3. The **width of the slot** the image will fill when the media condition is true ( `480px`)\n\n**Note:**\nIn `sizes`, you can use any [length value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length). For example, rather than providing an absolute width (for example, `480px`), you can alternatively provide a width relative to the viewport (for example, `50vw`). However, you cannot use a percentage as the slot width. You may have noticed that the last slot width has no media condition (this is the default that is chosen when none of the media conditions are true). The browser ignores everything after the first matching condition, so be careful how you order the media conditions.\n\nSo, with these attributes in place, the browser will:\n\n1. Look at screen size, pixel density, zoom level, screen orientation, and network speed.\n2. Work out which media condition in the `sizes` list is the first one to be true.\n3. Look at the slot size given to that media query.\n4. Load the image referenced in the `srcset` list that has the same size as the slot or, if there isn't one, the first image that is bigger than the chosen slot size.\n\nAnd that's it! At this point, if a supporting browser with a viewport width of 480px loads the page, the `(max-width: 600px)` media condition will be true, and so the browser chooses the `480px` slot. The `elva-fairy-480w.jpg` will be loaded, as its inherent width ( `480w`) is closest to the slot size. The 800px picture is 128KB on disk, whereas the 480px version is only 63KB — a saving of 65KB. Now, imagine if this was a page that had many pictures on it. Using this technique could save mobile users a lot of bandwidth.\n\n**Note:**\nWhen testing this with a desktop browser, if the browser fails to load the narrower images when you've got its window set to the narrowest width, have a look at what the viewport is (you can approximate it by going into the browser's JavaScript console and typing in `document.querySelector('html').clientWidth`). Different browsers have minimum sizes that they'll let you reduce the window width to, and they might be wider than you'd think. When testing it with a mobile browser, you can use tools like Firefox's `about:debugging` page to inspect the page loaded on the mobile using the desktop developer tools.\n\nTo see which images were loaded, you can use Firefox DevTools's [Network Monitor](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/network_monitor/index.html) tab or Chrome DevTools's [Network](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/) panel. For Chrome, you may also want to [disable cache](https://stackoverflow.com/a/7000899/13725861) to prevent it from picking already downloaded images.\n\nOlder browsers that don't support these features will just ignore them. Instead, those browsers will go ahead and load the image referenced in the [`src`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#src) attribute as normal.\n\n**Note:**\nIn the [`<head>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head) of the example linked above, you'll find the line `<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width\">`: this forces mobile browsers to adopt their real viewport width for loading web pages (some mobile browsers lie about their viewport width, and instead load pages at a larger viewport width then shrink the loaded page down, which is not very helpful for responsive images or design).\n\n## Resolution switching: Same size, different resolutions\nSuppose you have an image that will be rendered at the same real-world size on displays that have different screen resolutions. You can provide a better user experience on high resolution displays by serving a higher resolution version of the image.\n\nTo achieve this you can allow the browser to choose an appropriate resolution image by using `srcset` with x-descriptors and without `sizes` — a somewhat easier syntax! You can find an example of what this looks like in [srcset-resolutions.html](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/html/multimedia-and-embedding/responsive-images/srcset-resolutions.html) (see also [the source code](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/multimedia-and-embedding/responsive-images/srcset-resolutions.html)):\n\n```html\n<img\n  srcset=\"elva-fairy-320w.jpg, elva-fairy-480w.jpg 1.5x, elva-fairy-640w.jpg 2x\"\n  src=\"elva-fairy-640w.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Elva dressed as a fairy\" />\n```\n\nNote that even though the image is always displayed with the same size, on higher resolution displays you get to see more details.\n\n![A picture of a little girl dressed up as a fairy, with an old camera film effect applied to the image](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Responsive_images/resolution-example.png)\n\nIn this example, the following CSS is applied to the image so that it will have a width of 320 pixels on the screen (also called CSS pixels):\n\n```css\nimg {\n  width: 320px;\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, `sizes` is not needed — the browser works out what resolution the display is that it is being shown on, and serves the most appropriate image referenced in the `srcset`. So if the device accessing the page has a standard/low resolution display, with one [device pixel](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Device_pixel) representing each CSS pixel, the `elva-fairy-320w.jpg` image will be loaded (the 1x is implied, so you don't need to include it.) If the device has a high resolution of two device pixels per CSS pixel or more, the `elva-fairy-640w.jpg` image will be loaded. The 640px image is 93KB, whereas the 320px image is only 39KB.\n\n## Art direction\nTo recap, the **art direction problem** involves wanting to change the image displayed to suit different image display sizes. For example, a web page includes a large landscape shot with a person in the middle when viewed on a desktop browser. When viewed on a mobile browser, that same image is shrunk down, making the person in the image very small and hard to see. It would probably be better to show a smaller, portrait image on mobile, which zooms in on the person. The [`<picture>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture) element allows us to implement just this kind of solution.\n\nReturning to our original [not-responsive.html](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/html/multimedia-and-embedding/responsive-images/not-responsive.html) example, we have an image that badly needs art direction:\n\n```html\n<img src=\"elva-800w.jpg\" alt=\"Chris standing up holding his daughter Elva\" />\n```\n\nLet's fix this, with [`<picture>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture)! Like [`<video>` and `<audio>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/HTML_video_and_audio), the `<picture>` element is a wrapper containing several [`<source>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/source) elements that provide different sources for the browser to choose from, followed by the all-important [`<img>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img) element. The code in [responsive.html](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/html/multimedia-and-embedding/responsive-images/responsive.html) looks like so:\n\n```html\n<picture>\n  <source media=\"(max-width: 799px)\" srcset=\"elva-480w-close-portrait.jpg\" />\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 800px)\" srcset=\"elva-800w.jpg\" />\n  <img src=\"elva-800w.jpg\" alt=\"Chris standing up holding his daughter Elva\" />\n</picture>\n```\n\n- The `<source>` elements include a `media` attribute that contains a media condition — as with the first `srcset` example, these conditions are tests that decide which image is shown — the first one that returns true will be displayed. In this case, if the viewport width is 799px wide or less, the first `<source>` element's image will be displayed. If the viewport width is 800px or more, it'll be the second one.\n- The `srcset` attributes contain the path to the image to display. Just as we saw with `<img>` above, `<source>` can take a `srcset` attribute with multiple images referenced, as well as a `sizes` attribute. So, you could offer multiple images via a `<picture>` element, but then also offer multiple resolutions of each one. Realistically, you probably won't want to do this kind of thing very often.\n- In all cases, you must provide an `<img>` element, with `src` and `alt`, right before `</picture>`, otherwise no images will appear. This provides a default case that will apply when none of the media conditions return true (you could actually remove the second `<source>` element in this example), and a fallback for browsers that don't support the `<picture>` element.\n\nThis code allows us to display a suitable image on both wide screen and narrow screen displays, as shown below:\n\n![Our example site as viewed on a wide screen - here the first image works OK, as it is big enough to see the detail in the center.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Responsive_images/picture-element-wide.png)![Our example site as viewed on a narrow screen with the picture element used to switch the first image to a portrait close up of the detail, making it a lot more useful on a narrow screen](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Responsive_images/picture-element-narrow.png)\n\n**Note:**\nYou should use the `media` attribute only in art direction scenarios; when you do use `media`, don't also offer media conditions within the `sizes` attribute.\n\n## Why can't we just do this using CSS or JavaScript?\nWhen the browser starts to load a page, it starts to download (preload) any images before the main parser has started to load and interpret the page's CSS and JavaScript. That mechanism is useful in general for reducing page load times, but it is not helpful for responsive images — hence the need to implement solutions like `srcset`. For example, you couldn't load the [`<img>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img) element, then detect the viewport width with JavaScript, and then dynamically change the source image to a smaller one if desired. By then, the original image would already have been loaded, and you would load the small image as well, which is even worse in responsive image terms.\n\n## Active learning: Implementing your own responsive images\nFor this active learning, we're expecting you to be brave and do it alone, mostly. We want you to implement your own suitable art-directed narrow screen/wide screenshot using `<picture>`, and a resolution switching example that uses `srcset`.\n\n1. Write some simple HTML to contain your code (use `not-responsive.html` as a starting point, if you like).\n2. Find a nice wide screen landscape image with some kind of detail contained in it somewhere. Create a web-sized version of it using a graphics editor, then crop it to show a smaller part that zooms in on the detail, and create a second image (about 480px wide is good for this).\n3. Use the `<picture>` element to implement an art direction picture switcher!\n4. Create multiple image files of different sizes, each showing the same picture.\n5. Use `srcset`/ `sizes` to create a resolution switcher example, either to serve the same size image at different resolutions depending on the device resolution or to serve different image sizes depending on the viewport widths.\n\n## Summary\nThat's a wrap for responsive images — we hope you enjoyed playing with these new techniques. As a recap, there are two distinct problems we've been discussing here:\n\n- **Art direction**: The problem whereby you want to serve cropped images for different layouts — for example a landscape image showing a full scene for a desktop layout, and a portrait image showing the main subject zoomed in for a mobile layout. You can solve this problem using the [`<picture>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture) element.\n- **Resolution switching**: The problem whereby you want to serve smaller image files to narrow-screen devices, as they don't need huge images like desktop displays do — and to serve different resolution images to high density/low density screens. You can solve this problem using [vector graphics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Including_vector_graphics_in_HTML) (SVG images) and the [`srcset`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#srcset) with [`sizes`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#sizes) attributes.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Responsive_images", "title": "Responsive images", "description": "In this article, we'll learn about the concept of responsive images — images that work well on devices with widely differing screen sizes, resolutions, and other such features — and look at what tools HTML provides to help implement them.

This article provides a simple introduction to both areas, along with demos.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n\n## Speech recognition\nSpeech recognition involves receiving speech through a device's microphone, which is then checked by a speech recognition service against a list of grammar (basically, the vocabulary you want to have recognized in a particular app.) When a word or phrase is successfully recognized, it is returned as a result (or list of results) as a text string, and further actions can be initiated as a result.\n\nThe Web Speech API has a main controller interface for this — `SpeechRecognition` — plus a number of closely-related interfaces for representing grammar, results, etc. Generally, the default speech recognition system available on the device will be used for the speech recognition — most modern OSes have a speech recognition system for issuing voice commands. Think about Dictation on macOS, Siri on iOS, Cortana on Windows 10, Android Speech, etc.\n\n**Note:**\nOn some browsers, such as Chrome, using Speech Recognition on a web page involves a server-based recognition engine. Your audio is sent to a web service for recognition processing, so it won't work offline.\n\n## Demo\nTo show simple usage of Web speech recognition, we've written a demo called [Speech color changer](https://github.com/mdn/dom-examples/tree/main/web-speech-api/speech-color-changer). When the screen is tapped/clicked, you can say an HTML color keyword, and the app's background color will change to that color.\n\n![The UI of an app titled Speech Color changer. It invites the user to tap the screen and say a color, and then it turns the background of the app that color. In this case it has turned the background red.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API/Using_the_Web_Speech_API/speech-color-changer.png)\n\nTo run the demo, navigate to the [live demo URL](https://mdn.github.io/dom-examples/web-speech-api/speech-color-changer/) in a supporting mobile browser (such as Chrome).\n\n## HTML and CSS\nThe HTML and CSS for the app is really trivial. We have a title, instructions paragraph, and a div into which we output diagnostic messages.\n\n```html\n<h1>Speech color changer</h1>\n<p>Tap/click then say a color to change the background color of the app.</p>\n<div>\n  <p class=\"output\"><em>…diagnostic messages</em></p>\n</div>\n``` \n\nThe CSS provides a very simple responsive styling so that it looks OK across devices.\n\n## JavaScript\nLet's look at the JavaScript in a bit more detail.\n\n#### Prefixed properties\n\nBrowsers currently support speech recognition with prefixed properties.\nTherefore at the start of our code we include these lines to allow for both prefixed properties and unprefixed versions that may be supported in future:\n\n```javascript\nconst SpeechRecognition =\n  window.SpeechRecognition || window.webkitSpeechRecognition;\nconst SpeechGrammarList =\n  window.SpeechGrammarList || window.webkitSpeechGrammarList;\nconst SpeechRecognitionEvent =\n  window.SpeechRecognitionEvent || window.webkitSpeechRecognitionEvent;\n``` \n\n#### The grammar\n\nThe next part of our code defines the grammar we want our app to recognize. The following variable is defined to hold our grammar:\n\n```javascript\nconst colors = [\n  \"aqua\",\n  \"azure\",\n  \"beige\",\n  \"bisque\",\n  \"black\",\n  \"blue\",\n  \"brown\",\n  \"chocolate\",\n  \"coral\" /* … */,\n];\nconst grammar = `#JSGF V1.0; grammar colors; public <color> = ${colors.join(\n  \" | \",\n)};`;\n``` \n\nThe grammar format used is [JSpeech Grammar Format](https://www.w3.org/TR/jsgf/) ( **JSGF**) — you can find a lot more about it at the previous link to its spec. However, for now let's just run through it quickly:\n\n- The lines are separated by semicolons, just like in JavaScript.\n- The first line — `#JSGF V1.0;` — states the format and version used. This always needs to be included first.\n- The second line indicates a type of term that we want to recognize. `public` declares that it is a public rule, the string in angle brackets defines the recognized name for this term ( `color`), and the list of items that follow the equals sign are the alternative values that will be recognized and accepted as appropriate values for the term. Note how each is separated by a pipe character.\n- You can have as many terms defined as you want on separate lines following the above structure, and include fairly complex grammar definitions. For this basic demo, we are just keeping things simple.\n\n#### Plugging the grammar into our speech recognition\n\nThe next thing to do is define a speech recognition instance to control the recognition for our application. This is done using the [`SpeechRecognition()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition/SpeechRecognition \"SpeechRecognition()\") constructor. We also create a new speech grammar list to contain our grammar, using the [`SpeechGrammarList()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechGrammarList/SpeechGrammarList \"SpeechGrammarList()\") constructor.\n\n```javascript\nconst recognition = new SpeechRecognition();\nconst speechRecognitionList = new SpeechGrammarList();\n``` \n\nWe add our `grammar` to the list using the [`SpeechGrammarList.addFromString()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechGrammarList/addFromString) method. This accepts as parameters the string we want to add, plus optionally a weight value that specifies the importance of this grammar in relation of other grammars available in the list (can be from 0 to 1 inclusive.) The added grammar is available in the list as a [`SpeechGrammar`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechGrammar) object instance.\n\n```javascript\nspeechRecognitionList.addFromString(grammar, 1);\n``` \n\nWe then add the [`SpeechGrammarList`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechGrammarList) to the speech recognition instance by setting it to the value of the [`SpeechRecognition.grammars`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition/grammars) property. We also set a few other properties of the recognition instance before we move on:\n\n- [`SpeechRecognition.continuous`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition/continuous): Controls whether continuous results are captured ( `true`), or just a single result each time recognition is started ( `false`).\n- [`SpeechRecognition.lang`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition/lang): Sets the language of the recognition. Setting this is good practice, and therefore recommended.\n- [`SpeechRecognition.interimResults`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition/interimResults): Defines whether the speech recognition system should return interim results, or just final results. Final results are good enough for this simple demo.\n- [`SpeechRecognition.maxAlternatives`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition/maxAlternatives): Sets the number of alternative potential matches that should be returned per result. This can sometimes be useful, say if a result is not completely clear and you want to display a list if alternatives for the user to choose the correct one from. But it is not needed for this simple demo, so we are just specifying one (which is actually the default anyway.)\n\n```javascript\nrecognition.grammars = speechRecognitionList;\nrecognition.continuous = false;\nrecognition.lang = \"en-US\";\nrecognition.interimResults = false;\nrecognition.maxAlternatives = 1;\n``` \n\n#### Starting the speech recognition\n\nAfter grabbing references to the output [`<div>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div) and the HTML element (so we can output diagnostic messages and update the app background color later on), we implement an onclick handler so that when the screen is tapped/clicked, the speech recognition service will start. This is achieved by calling [`SpeechRecognition.start()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition/start). The `forEach()` method is used to output colored indicators showing what colors to try saying.\n\n```javascript\nconst diagnostic = document.querySelector(\".output\");\nconst bg = document.querySelector(\"html\");\nconst hints = document.querySelector(\".hints\");\n\nlet colorHTML = \"\";\ncolors.forEach((color, i) => {\n  console.log(color, i);\n  colorHTML += `<span style=\\\"background-color:${color};\\\"> ${color} </span>`;\n});\nhints.innerHTML = `Tap or click then say a color to change the background color of the app. Try ${colorHTML}.`;\n\ndocument.body.onclick = () => {\n  recognition.start();\n  console.log(\"Ready to receive a color command.\");\n};\n``` \n\n#### Receiving and handling results\n\nOnce the speech recognition is started, there are many event handlers that can be used to retrieve results, and other pieces of surrounding information (see the [`SpeechRecognition` events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition#events).) The most common one you'll probably use is the [`result`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition/result_event \"result\") event, which is fired once a successful result is received:\n\n```javascript\nrecognition.onresult = (event) => {\n  const color = event.results[0][0].transcript;\n  diagnostic.textContent = `Result received: ${color}.`;\n  bg.style.backgroundColor = color;\n  console.log(`Confidence: ${event.results[0][0].confidence}`);\n};\n``` \n\nThe second line here is a bit complex-looking, so let's explain it step by step. The [`SpeechRecognitionEvent.results`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognitionEvent/results) property returns a [`SpeechRecognitionResultList`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognitionResultList) object containing [`SpeechRecognitionResult`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognitionResult) objects. It has a getter so it can be accessed like an array — so the first `[0]` returns the `SpeechRecognitionResult` at position 0. Each `SpeechRecognitionResult` object contains [`SpeechRecognitionAlternative`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognitionAlternative) objects that contain individual recognized words. These also have getters so they can be accessed like arrays — the second `[0]` therefore returns the `SpeechRecognitionAlternative` at position 0. We then return its `transcript` property to get a string containing the individual recognized result as a string, set the background color to that color, and report the color recognized as a diagnostic message in the UI.\n\nWe also use the [`speechend`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition/speechend_event \"speechend\") event to stop the speech recognition service from running (using [`SpeechRecognition.stop()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition/stop)) once a single word has been recognized and it has finished being spoken:\n\n```javascript\nrecognition.onspeechend = () => {\n  recognition.stop();\n};\n``` \n\n#### Handling errors and unrecognized speech\n\nThe last two handlers are there to handle cases where speech was recognized that wasn't in the defined grammar, or an error occurred. The [`nomatch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition/nomatch_event \"nomatch\") event seems to be supposed to handle the first case mentioned, although note that at the moment it doesn't seem to fire correctly; it just returns whatever was recognized anyway:\n\n```javascript\nrecognition.onnomatch = (event) => {\n  diagnostic.textContent = \"I didn't recognize that color.\";\n};\n``` \n\nThe [`error`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition/error_event \"error\") event handles cases where there is an actual error with the recognition successfully — the [`SpeechRecognitionErrorEvent.error`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognitionErrorEvent/error) property contains the actual error returned:\n\n```javascript\nrecognition.onerror = (event) => {\n  diagnostic.textContent = `Error occurred in recognition: ${event.error}`;\n};\n``` \n\n\n\n## Speech synthesis\nSpeech synthesis (aka text-to-speech, or TTS) involves receiving synthesizing text contained within an app to speech, and playing it out of a device's speaker or audio output connection.\n\nThe Web Speech API has a main controller interface for this — [`SpeechSynthesis`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesis) — plus a number of closely-related interfaces for representing text to be synthesized (known as utterances), voices to be used for the utterance, etc. Again, most OSes have some kind of speech synthesis system, which will be used by the API for this task as available.\n\n## Demo\nTo show simple usage of Web speech synthesis, we've provided a demo called [Speak easy synthesis](https://github.com/mdn/dom-examples/tree/main/web-speech-api/speak-easy-synthesis). This includes a set of form controls for entering text to be synthesized, and setting the pitch, rate, and voice to use when the text is uttered. After you have entered your text, you can press `Enter`/ `Return` to hear it spoken.\n\n![UI of an app called speak easy synthesis. It has an input field in which to input text to be synthesized, slider controls to change the rate and pitch of the speech, and a drop down menu to choose between different voices.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API/Using_the_Web_Speech_API/speak-easy-synthesis.png)\n\nTo run the demo, navigate to the [live demo URL](https://mdn.github.io/dom-examples/web-speech-api/speak-easy-synthesis/) in a supporting mobile browser.\n\n## HTML and CSS\nThe HTML and CSS are again pretty trivial, containing a title, some instructions for use, and a form with some simple controls. The [`<select>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select) element is initially empty, but is populated with [`<option>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/option) s via JavaScript (see later on.)\n\n```html\n<h1>Speech synthesizer</h1>\n\n<p>\n  Enter some text in the input below and press return to hear it. Change voices\n  using the dropdown menu.\n</p>\n\n<form>\n  <input type=\"text\" class=\"txt\" />\n  <div>\n    <label for=\"rate\">Rate</label\n    ><input type=\"range\" min=\"0.5\" max=\"2\" value=\"1\" step=\"0.1\" id=\"rate\" />\n    <div class=\"rate-value\">1</div>\n    <div class=\"clearfix\"></div>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <label for=\"pitch\">Pitch</label\n    ><input type=\"range\" min=\"0\" max=\"2\" value=\"1\" step=\"0.1\" id=\"pitch\" />\n    <div class=\"pitch-value\">1</div>\n    <div class=\"clearfix\"></div>\n  </div>\n  <select></select>\n</form>\n```\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API/Using_the_Web_Speech_API", "title": "Using the Web Speech API", "description": "The Web Speech API provides two distinct areas of functionality — speech recognition, and speech synthesis (also known as text to speech, or tts) — which open up interesting new possibilities for accessibility, and control mechanisms.

It consists of key/value pairs, where keys are strings and values can be strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, or null.\n\n## Data Types in JSON\nThe data types supported in JSON include:\n1. String\n2. Number\n3. Object\n4. Array\n5. Boolean\n6. Null\n\n## Best Practices for JSON\nWhen working with JSON, consider the following best practices:\n- Use consistent naming conventions for keys.\n- Keep the structure simple and avoid deeply nested objects.\n", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array", "title": "Understanding JSON Structure", "description": "This page provides an overview of JSON structure, including its syntax, data types, and best practices for usage.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 4, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 06:59:37", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "ogDescription": "The Array object, as with arrays in other programming languages, enables storing a collection of multiple items under a single variable name, and has members for performing common array operations.", "ogUrl": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array", "ogLocale": "en_US", "ogSiteName": "MDN Web Docs", "og:url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array", "og:title": "Array - JavaScript | MDN", "ogTitle": "Array - JavaScript | MDN", "og:type": "website", "og:locale": "en_US", "og:description": "The Array object, as with arrays in other programming languages, enables storing a collection of multiple items under a single variable name, and has members for performing common array operations.", "og:image:type": "image/png", "og:image": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "title": "Array - JavaScript | MDN", "og:image:height": "1080", "og:site_name": "MDN Web Docs", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "ogImage": "https://developer.mozilla.org/mdn-social-share.d893525a4fb5fb1f67a2.png", "twitter:creator": "MozDevNet", "description": "The Array object, as with arrays in other programming languages, enables storing a collection of multiple items under a single variable name, and has members for performing common array operations.", "language": "en-US", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "favicon": "https://developer.mozilla.org/favicon-48x48.bc390275e955dacb2e65.png", "og:image:alt": "The MDN Web Docs logo, featuring a blue accent color, displayed on a solid black background.", "og:image:width": "1920", "scrapeId": "295b5194-ce21-4e3b-8ff1-38807675e1ec", "sourceURL": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array", "url": "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array", "statusCode": 200}}}
