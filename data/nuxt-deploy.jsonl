By default, Nuxt will detect this deployment environment to enable the `azure` preset.\n\n## Local preview\n\nInstall [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local) if you want to test locally.\n\nYou can invoke a development environment to preview before deploying.\n\n## Configuration\n\nAzure Static Web Apps are [configured](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/configuration) using the `staticwebapp.config.json` file.\n\nNuxt automatically generates this configuration file whenever the application is built with the `azure` preset.\n\nIt adds the following properties based on the following criteria:\n\n| Property | Criteria | Default |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **[platform.apiRuntime](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/configuration#platform)** | Will automatically set to `node:16` or `node:14` depending on your package configuration. | `node:16` |\n| **[navigationFallback.rewrite](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/configuration#fallback-routes)** | Is always `/api/server` | `/api/server` |\n| **[routes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/configuration#routes)** | All prerendered routes are added. Additionally, if you do not have an `index.html` file an empty one is created for you for compatibility purposes and also requests to `/index.html` are redirected to the root directory which is handled by `/api/server`. | `[]` |\n\n## Custom Configuration\n\nYou can alter the generated configuration using `azure.config` option. For instance, if you wanted to specify a Node runtime for your Azure Functions, edit your `nuxt.config.ts` file to the following:\n\nnuxt.config.ts\n\n```\nexport default defineNuxtConfig({\n  // ...\n  nitro: {\n    azure: {\n      config: {\n        // ...\n        platform: {\n          apiRuntime: 'node:18'\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\nCustom routes will be added and matched first. In the case of a conflict (determined if an object has the same route property), custom routes will override generated ones.\n\n## Deploy from CI/CD via GitHub Actions\n\nWhen you link your GitHub repository to Azure Static Web Apps, a workflow file is added to the repository.\n\nWhen you are asked to select your framework, select custom and provide the following information:\n\n| Input | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| **app_location** | '/' |\n| **api_location** | '.output/server' |\n| **output_location** | '.output/public' |\n\nIf you miss this step, you can always find the build configuration section in your workflow and update the build configuration:\n\n.github/workflows/azure-static-web-apps-<RANDOM_NAME>.yml\n\n```\n###### Repository/Build Configurations ######\napp_location: '/'\napi_location: '.output/server'\noutput_location: '.output/public'\n###### End of Repository/Build Configurations ######\n```\n\nThat's it! Now Azure Static Web Apps will automatically deploy your Nitro-powered application on push.\n\nIf you are using `runtimeConfig`, you will likely want to configure the corresponding [environment variables on Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/application-settings).\n\n## More options\n\nLearn about the other Azure deployment presets on Nitro documentation.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nuxt.com/deploy/azure", "title": "Deploy", "description": "Deploy your Nuxt Application to Azure infrastructure.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 6, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 00:55:46", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"theme-color": "#020420", "og:image:width": "1200", "og:site_name": "Nuxt", "description": "Deploy your Nuxt Application to Azure infrastructure.", "twitter:site": "nuxt_js", "og:image:height": "600", "language": "en", "title": "Deploy Nuxt to Azure", "og:type": "website", "twitter:image:height": "600", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "twitter:image": "https://nuxt.com/__og-image__/static/deploy/azure/og.png", "twitter:image:width": "1200", "ogDescription": "Deploy your Nuxt Application to Azure infrastructure.", "favicon": "https://nuxt.com/icon.png", "ogImage": "https://nuxt.com/__og-image__/static/deploy/azure/og.png", "og:description": "Deploy your Nuxt Application to Azure infrastructure.", "og:title": "Deploy Nuxt to Azure", "twitter:image:src": "https://nuxt.com/__og-image__/static/deploy/azure/og.png", "ogSiteName": "Nuxt", "ogTitle": "Deploy Nuxt to Azure", "og:image": "https://nuxt.com/__og-image__/static/deploy/azure/og.png", "og:image:type": "image/png", "scrapeId": "3dcd65e7-d9ca-4617-a5a5-b1c758b5783f", "sourceURL": "https://nuxt.com/deploy/azure", "url": "https://nuxt.com/deploy/azure", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful nuxt-deploy expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Deploying Nuxt Applications to Firebase is in nuxt-deploy?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Deploying Nuxt Applications to Firebase in nuxt-deploy.\n\n# Deploying Nuxt Applications to Firebase\n\nA comprehensive guide on deploying your Nuxt application to Firebase infrastructure, including setup, configuration, and best practices.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Firebase Functions\n\nTo use the more recent and recommended generation of firebase functions, set the `firebase.gen` option to `2`:\n\nnuxt.config.ts\n\n```\nexport default defineNuxtConfig({\n  nitro: {\n    firebase: {\n      gen: 2\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\nIf you cannot use configuration for any reason, alternatively you can use `NITRO_FIREBASE_GEN=2` environment variable.\n\nIf you already have a deployed version of your website and want to upgrade to 2nd gen, [see the Migration process on Firebase docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/2nd-gen-upgrade). Namely, the CLI will ask you to delete your existing functions before deploying the new ones.\n\n## Project Setup\n\nYou may instead prefer to set up your project with the Firebase CLI, which will fetch your project ID for you, add required dependencies (see above) and even set up automated deployments via GitHub Actions (for hosting only). [Learn about installing the firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#windows-npm).\n\n1. Install the latest version of the Firebase CLI.\n\nTerminal\n\n```\nnpm install -g firebase-tools@latest\n```\n\n2. Initialize your Firebase Project\n\nTerminal\n\n```\nfirebase login\nfirebase init hosting\n```\n\nWhen prompted, you can enter `.output/public` as the public directory. In the next step, **do not** configure your project as a single-page app.\n\nOnce complete, add the following to your `firebase.json` to enable server rendering in Cloud Functions:\n\nfirebase.json\n\n```\n{\n  \"functions\": { \"source\": \".output/server\" },\n  \"hosting\": [\\\n    {\\\n      \"site\": \"<your_project_id>\",\\\n      \"public\": \".output/public\",\\\n      \"cleanUrls\": true,\\\n      \"rewrites\": [{ \"source\": \"**\", \"function\": \"server\" }]\\\n    }\\\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Local Preview\n\nYou can preview a local version of your site if you need to test things out without deploying.\n\n```\nnpm run build -- --preset=firebase\nfirebase emulators:start\n```\n\n## Build and Deploy\n\nDeploy to Firebase Hosting by running a Nitro build and then running the `firebase deploy` command.\n\n```\nnpm run build -- --preset=firebase\nfirebase deploy\n```\n\n## Options\n\nYou can set options for the firebase functions in your `nuxt.config.ts` file:\n\nnuxt.config.ts\n\n```\nexport default defineNuxtConfig({\n  nitro: {\n    firebase: {\n      gen: 2,\n      httpsOptions: {\n        region: 'europe-west1',\n        maxInstances: 3,\n      },\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\n## Runtime Node.js Version\n\nYou can set custom Node.js version in configuration:\n\nnuxt.config.ts\n\n```\nexport default defineNuxtConfig({\n  nitro: {\n    firebase: {\n      nodeVersion: '18' // Can be '16' or '18' or '20'\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\nFirebase tools use the `engines.node` version in `package.json` to determine which node version to use for your functions. Nuxt automatically writes to the `.output/server/package.json` with configured Node.js version.\n\nYou might also need to add a runtime key to your `firebase.json` file:\n\nfirebase.json\n\n```\n{\n  \"functions\": {\n    \"source\": \".output/server\",\n    \"runtime\": \"nodejs20\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## If your firebase project has other cloud functions\n\nYou may be warned that other cloud functions will be deleted when you deploy your Nuxt project. This is because nitro will deploy your entire project to firebase functions. If you want to deploy only your Nuxt project, you can use the `--only` flag:\n\n```\nfirebase deploy --only functions:server,hosting\n```\n\n## Using Cookies in production\n\nWhen using Firebase Hosting together with Cloud Functions or Cloud Run, cookies are generally stripped from incoming requests to allow for efficient CDN cache behavior. Only the specially-named `__session` cookie is permitted to pass through to your app.\n\nFor more information, refer to the **Firebase documentation**.\n\n## Working with Environment Variables\n\nTo set environment variables for your Firebase functions, you need to copy the `.env` file to the `.output/server` directory.\nYou can do this by adding a `postbuild` script to your `package.json`, that will automatically run after the build command:\n\npackage.json\n\n```\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"postbuild\": \"cp .env .output/server/.env\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nuxt.com/deploy/firebase", "title": "Deploying Nuxt Applications to Firebase", "description": "A comprehensive guide on deploying your Nuxt application to Firebase infrastructure, including setup, configuration, and best practices.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 9, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 00:57:14", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"ogDescription": "Deploy your Nuxt Application to Firebase infrastructure.", "twitter:image": "https://nuxt.com/__og-image__/static/deploy/firebase/og.png", "ogTitle": "Deploy Nuxt to Firebase", "twitter:image:height": "600", "theme-color": "#020420", "description": "Deploy your Nuxt Application to Firebase infrastructure.", "og:title": "Deploy Nuxt to Firebase", "language": "en", "twitter:image:src": "https://nuxt.com/__og-image__/static/deploy/firebase/og.png", "ogImage": "https://nuxt.com/__og-image__/static/deploy/firebase/og.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:image:height": "600", "og:description": "Deploy your Nuxt Application to Firebase infrastructure.", "twitter:site": "nuxt_js", "ogSiteName": "Nuxt", "og:image:width": "1200", "title": "Deploy Nuxt to Firebase", "og:image:type": "image/png", "og:image": "https://nuxt.com/__og-image__/static/deploy/firebase/og.png", "favicon": "https://nuxt.com/icon.png", "twitter:image:width": "1200", "og:site_name": "Nuxt", "og:type": "website", "scrapeId": "5acd2da8-d07d-4d8c-a62d-866c353bb3ff", "sourceURL": "https://nuxt.com/deploy/firebase", "url": "https://nuxt.com/deploy/firebase", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful nuxt-deploy expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Deploying Nuxt Applications to Vercel is in nuxt-deploy?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Deploying Nuxt Applications to Vercel in nuxt-deploy.\n\n# Deploying Nuxt Applications to Vercel\n\nThis page covers how to deploy your Nuxt application to Vercel infrastructure with various options and configurations.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Vercel\n\nDeploy your Nuxt Application to Vercel infrastructure.\n\n**Zero Configuration ✨**\n\nIntegration with Vercel is possible with zero configuration, [learn more](https://nitro.unjs.io/deploy#zero-config-providers).\n\n## Deploy using Git\n\n1. Push your code to your git repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).\n2. [Import your project](https://vercel.com/new) into Vercel.\n3. Vercel will detect that you are using Nitro and will enable the correct settings for your deployment.\n4. Your application is deployed!\n\nAfter your project has been imported and deployed, all subsequent pushes to branches will generate [Preview Deployments](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deploy/environments#preview), and all changes made to the Production Branch (commonly “main”) will result in a [Production Deployment](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deploy/environments#production).\n\nLearn more about Vercel’s [Git Integration](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/git).\n\n## Vercel Edge Functions\n\nIt is possible to deploy your Nuxt applications directly on [Vercel Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions).\n\n> Vercel Edge Functions allow you to deliver content to your site's visitors with speed and personalization.\n> They are deployed globally by default on Vercel's Edge Network and enable you to move server-side logic to the Edge, close to your visitor's origin.\n> Edge Functions use the Vercel Edge Runtime, which is built on the same high-performance V8 JavaScript and WebAssembly engine that is used by the Chrome browser.\n> By taking advantage of this small runtime, Edge Functions can have faster cold boots and higher scalability than Serverless Functions.\n> Edge Functions run after the cache, and can both cache and return responses. [Read More](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions)\n\nIn order to enable this target, set the following environment variable:\n\n```\nSERVER_PRESET=vercel_edge\n```\n\nOr update the build command to `nuxt build --preset=vercel_edge`.\n\n## Vercel KV Storage\n\nYou can easily use [Vercel KV Storage](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-kv) with [Nuxt Server Storage](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/server#server-storage).\n\nRead more about the Vercel KV driver on Unstorage documentation.\n\n1. Install `@vercel/kv` dependency:\n\nTerminal\n\n```\nnpm i @vercel/kv\n```\n\n2. Update your `nuxt.config`:\n\nnuxt.config.ts\n\n```\nexport default defineNuxtConfig({\n     nitro: {\n       storage: {\n         data: {\n           driver: 'vercelKV'\n           /* Vercel KV driver options */\n         }\n       }\n     }\n})\n```\n\nYou need to either set `KV_REST_API_URL` and `KV_REST_API_TOKEN` environment variables or pass `url` and `token` to driver options. Check [driver docs](https://unstorage.unjs.io/drivers/vercel-kv) for more information about usage.\n\nYou can now access your data store anywhere in your `server/` directory:\n\nserver/routes/hello.ts\n\n```\nexport default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {\n  const dataStorage = useStorage('data');\n  await dataStorage.setItem('hello', 'world');\n\n  return {\n    hello: await dataStorage.getItem(\"hello\"),\n  }\n})\n```\n\n## Custom Build Output Configuration\n\nYou can provide additional [build output configuration](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3) using `nitro.vercel.config` key inside `nuxt.config`. It will be merged with built-in auto generated config.\n\n## Templates\n\nNuxt Vercel ISR\n\nExample of a Nuxt application with hybrid rendering deployed on Vercel.\n\nNuxt on the Edge on Vercel\n\nExample of a Nuxt application running on Vercel Edge Functions.\n\n## Learn More\n\nHead over **Nitro documentation** to learn more about On-Demand Incremental Static Regeneration or more advanced options.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nuxt.com/deploy/vercel", "title": "Deploying Nuxt Applications to Vercel", "description": "This page covers how to deploy your Nuxt application to Vercel infrastructure with various options and configurations.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 7, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 01:02:24", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"ogSiteName": "Nuxt", "twitter:image:width": "1200", "theme-color": "#020420", "og:site_name": "Nuxt", "favicon": "https://nuxt.com/icon.png", "language": "en", "ogImage": "https://nuxt.com/__og-image__/static/deploy/vercel/og.png", "description": "Deploy your Nuxt Application to Vercel infrastructure.", "twitter:image:height": "600", "og:image": "https://nuxt.com/__og-image__/static/deploy/vercel/og.png", "title": "Deploy Nuxt to Vercel", "twitter:image": "https://nuxt.com/__og-image__/static/deploy/vercel/og.png", "og:image:width": "1200", "og:description": "Deploy your Nuxt Application to Vercel infrastructure.", "ogTitle": "Deploy Nuxt to Vercel", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ogDescription": "Deploy your Nuxt Application to Vercel infrastructure.", "og:title": "Deploy Nuxt to Vercel", "twitter:image:src": "https://nuxt.com/__og-image__/static/deploy/vercel/og.png", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:type": "website", "twitter:site": "nuxt_js", "og:image:type": "image/png", "og:image:height": "600", "scrapeId": "48f7e1a4-64a9-45df-8b84-ec6f5393865c", "sourceURL": "https://nuxt.com/deploy/vercel", "url": "https://nuxt.com/deploy/vercel", "statusCode": 200}}}

Ensure you are logged in on admin.hub.nuxt.com\n2. Link your local project with a NuxtHub project or help you create a new one\n3. Build your Nuxt project with the correct preset\n4. Deploy it to your Cloudflare account with all the necessary resources\n5. Provide you with a URL to access your project\n\nYou can also install the NuxtHub CLI globally with: `npm i -g nuxthub`.\n\n## Deploy using Git\n\n1. Push your code to your git repository (GitHub)\n2. Click on `New Project` then `Import a Git repository`\n3. Select your repository and click on `Import repository`\n4.

Pushing to your repository will automatically build your project and deploy it.\n\nNuxt will detect the environment to set the correct [Server/Nitro preset](https://nitro.unjs.io/deploy/providers/cloudflare).\n\nTo leverage server-side rendering on the edge, set the build command to: `nuxt build`\n\nTo statically generate your website, set the build command to: `nuxt generate`.\n\n## Route matching\n\nOn CloudFlare Pages, if an HTML file is found with a matching path to the current route requested, it will serve it. It will also redirect HTML pages to their extension-less counterparts: for instance, `/contact.html` will be redirected to `/contact`, and `/about/index.html` will be redirected to `/about/`.\n\nTo match Cloudflare [route matching](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/serving-pages/#route-matching) rules, set the nitro option `autoSubfolderIndex` to `false`.\n\n## Direct Upload\n\nAlternatively, you can use [wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk) to upload your project to Cloudflare.\n\nIn this case, you will have to set the preset manually.\n\n1. Build your project for Cloudflare Pages:\n\nTerminal\n\n```\nnpx nuxi build --preset=cloudflare_pages\n```\n\n2. Deploy, it will ask you to create a project for the first time:\n\nTerminal\n\n```\nwrangler pages deploy dist/\n```\n\n## Templates\n\nAtidone\n\nA todos application with user authentication, SSR and Cloudflare D1.\n\nAtinotes\n\nAn editable website with universal rendering based on Cloudflare KV.\n\nAtidraw\n\nWeb application that lets you to draw and share your drawings with the world, with Cloudflare R2 & AI.\n\nNuxt Image Gallery\n\nAn image gallery to upload, edit and share your images to the world, with Cloudflare R2.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://nuxt.com/deploy/cloudflare", "title": "Cloudflare", "description": "Deploy your Nuxt Application to Cloudflare infrastructure.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 5, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 01:03:11", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:title": "Deploy Nuxt to Cloudflare", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "twitter:image:src": "https://nuxt.com/__og-image__/static/deploy/cloudflare/og.png", "favicon": "https://nuxt.com/icon.png", "og:type": "website", "og:description": "Deploy your Nuxt Application to Cloudflare infrastructure.", "ogImage": "https://nuxt.com/__og-image__/static/deploy/cloudflare/og.png", "og:image:height": "600", "twitter:image": "https://nuxt.com/__og-image__/static/deploy/cloudflare/og.png", "description": "Deploy your Nuxt Application to Cloudflare infrastructure.", "twitter:image:height": "600", "twitter:site": "nuxt_js", "title": "Deploy Nuxt to Cloudflare", "ogTitle": "Deploy Nuxt to Cloudflare", "ogDescription": "Deploy your Nuxt Application to Cloudflare infrastructure.", "ogSiteName": "Nuxt", "og:site_name": "Nuxt", "og:image:type": "image/png", "theme-color": "#020420", "language": "en", "og:image": "https://nuxt.com/__og-image__/static/deploy/cloudflare/og.png", "og:image:width": "1200", "twitter:image:width": "1200", "scrapeId": "aa940b4a-b393-4772-843b-ccc6bfe782c8", "sourceURL": "https://nuxt.com/deploy/cloudflare", "url": "https://nuxt.com/deploy/cloudflare", "statusCode": 200}}}
