{"text": "System: You are a helpful vue-about expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Code Of Conduct is in vue-about?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Code Of Conduct in vue-about.\n\n# Code Of Conduct\n\nThis document outlines the Code of Conduct for contributors and maintainers of the Vue.js project, detailing pledges, standards, responsibilities, scope, enforcement, and attribution.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Our Pledge\n\nIn the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, political party, or sexual identity and orientation. Note, however, that religion, political party, or other ideological affiliation provide no exemptions for the behavior we outline as unacceptable in this Code of Conduct.\n\n## Our Standards\n\nExamples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:\n\n- Using welcoming and inclusive language\n- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences\n- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism\n- Focusing on what is best for the community\n- Showing empathy towards other community members\n\nExamples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:\n\n- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances\n- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks\n- Public or private harassment\n- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission\n- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting\n\n## Our Responsibilities\n\nProject maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.\n\nProject maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.\n\n## Scope\n\nThis Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.\n\n## Enforcement\n\nInstances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at community@vuejs.org. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.\n\nProject maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.4, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html\n\nFor answers to common questions about this code of conduct, see https://www.contributor-covenant.org/faq\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://vuejs.org/about/coc.html", "title": "Code Of Conduct", "description": "This document outlines the Code of Conduct for contributors and maintainers of the Vue.js project, detailing pledges, standards, responsibilities, scope, enforcement, and attribution.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": false, "section_count": 6, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 00:57:53", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:url": "https://vuejs.org/", "ogUrl": "https://vuejs.org/", "twitter:site": "@vuejs", "description": "Vue.js - The Progressive JavaScript Framework", "twitter:card": "summary", "og:title": "Vue.js", "title": "Code Of Conduct | Vue.js", "og:type": "website", "og:description": "Vue.js - The Progressive JavaScript Framework", "favicon": "https://vuejs.org/logo.svg", "ogTitle": "Vue.js", "language": "en-US", "generator": "VitePress v1.6.3", "og:image": "https://vuejs.org/images/logo.png", "ogImage": "https://vuejs.org/images/logo.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#3c8772", "ogDescription": "Vue.js - The Progressive JavaScript Framework", "scrapeId": "3f20640c-2d62-42fe-b4b9-758226394dcb", "sourceURL": "https://vuejs.org/about/coc.html", "url": "https://vuejs.org/about/coc.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful vue-about expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Community Guide is in vue-about?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Community Guide in vue-about.\n\n# Community Guide\n\nVue's community is growing incredibly fast and if you're reading this, there's a good chance you're ready to join it. So... welcome! Now we'll answer both what the community can do for you and what you can do for the community.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Resources\n\n### Code of Conduct\nOur [Code of Conduct](https://vuejs.org/about/coc) is a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.\n\n### Stay in the Know\n- Follow our [official Twitter account](https://twitter.com/vuejs).\n- Follow our [team members](https://vuejs.org/about/team) on Twitter or GitHub.\n- Follow the [RFC discussions](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs).\n- Subscribe to the [official blog](https://blog.vuejs.org/).\n\n### Get Support\n- [Discord Chat](https://discord.com/invite/vue): A place for Vue devs to meet and chat in real time.\n- [Forum](https://forum.vuejs.org/): The best place to ask questions and get answers about Vue and its ecosystem.\n- [DEV Community](https://dev.to/t/vue): Share and discuss Vue related topics on Dev.to.\n- [Meetups](https://events.vuejs.org/meetups): Want to find local Vue enthusiasts like yourself? Interested in becoming a community leader? We have the help and support you need right here!\n- [GitHub](https://github.com/vuejs): If you have a bug to report or feature to request, that's what the GitHub issues are for. Please respect the rules specified in each repository's issue template.\n- [Twitter Community (unofficial)](https://twitter.com/i/communities/1516368750634840064): A Twitter community, where you can meet other Vue enthusiasts, get help, or just chat about Vue.\n\n### Explore the Ecosystem\n- [The Awesome Vue Page](https://github.com/vuejs/awesome-vue): See what other awesome resources have been published by other awesome people.\n- [Vue Telescope Explorer](https://vuetelescope.com/explore): Explore websites made with Vue, with insights on what framework / libraries they use.\n- [Made with Vue.js](https://madewithvuejs.com/): showcases of projects and libraries made with Vue.\n- [The \"Show and Tell\" Subforum](https://github.com/vuejs/core/discussions/categories/show-and-tell): Another great place to check out what others have built with and for the growing Vue ecosystem.\n\n## What You Can Do\n\n### Help Fellow Users\nCode contribution is not the only form of contribution to the Vue community. Answering a question for a fellow Vue user on Discord or the forum is also considered a valuable contribution.\n\n### Help Triage Issues\nTriaging an issue means gathering missing information, running the reproduction, verifying the issue's validity, and investigating the cause of the issue.\n\nWe receive many issues in [our repositories on GitHub](https://github.com/vuejs) every single day. Our bandwidth is limited compared to the amount of users we have, so issue triaging alone can take an enormous amount of effort from the team. By helping us triage the issues, you are helping us become more efficient, allowing us to spend time on higher priority work.\n\nYou don't have to triage an issue with the goal of fixing it (although that would be nice too). Sharing the result of your investigation, for example the commit that led to the bug, can already save us a ton of time.\n\n### Contribute Code\nContributing bug fixes or new features is the most direct form of contribution you can make.\n\nThe Vue core repository provides a [contributing guide](https://github.com/vuejs/core/blob/main/.github/contributing.md), which contains pull request guidelines and information regarding build setup and high-level architecture. Other sub-project repositories may also contain its own contribution guide - please make sure to read them before submitting pull requests.\n\nBug fixes are welcome at any time. For new features, it is best to discuss the use case and implementation details first in the [RFC repo](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/discussions).\n\n### Share (and Build) Your Experience\nApart from answering questions and sharing resources in the forum and chat, there are a few other less obvious ways to share and expand what you know:\n- **Develop learning materials.** It's often said that the best way to learn is to teach. If there's something interesting you're doing with Vue, strengthen your expertise by writing a blog post, developing a workshop, or even publishing a gist that you share on social media.\n- **Watch a repo you care about.** This will send you notifications whenever there's activity in that repository, giving you insider knowledge about ongoing discussions and upcoming features. It's a fantastic way to build expertise so that you're eventually able to help address issues and pull requests.\n\n### Translate Docs\nI hope that right now, you're reading this sentence in your preferred language. If not, would you like to help us get there?\n\nSee the [Translations guide](https://vuejs.org/translations/) for more details on how you can get involved.\n\n### Become a Community Leader\nThere's a lot you can do to help Vue grow in your community:\n- **Present at your local meetup.** Whether it's giving a talk or running a workshop, you can bring a lot of value to your community by helping both new and experienced Vue developers continue to grow.\n- **Start your own meetup.** If there's not already a Vue meetup in your area, you can start your own!

{"text": "System: You are a helpful vue-about expert.\n\nUser: How do I what you can do in vue-about?\n\nAssistant: To what you can do in vue-about, here's what you do:\n### Help Fellow Users\nCode contribution is not the only form of contribution to the Vue community. Answering a question for a fellow Vue user on Discord or the forum is also considered a valuable contribution.\n\n### Help Triage Issues\nTriaging an issue means gathering missing information, running the reproduction, verifying the issue's validity, and investigating the cause of the issue.\n\nWe receive many issues in [our repositories on GitHub](https://github.com/vuejs) every single day. Our bandwidth is limited compared to the amount of users we have, so issue triaging alone can take an enormous amount of effort from the team. By helping us triage the issues, you are helping us become more efficient, allowing us to spend time on higher priority work.\n\nYou don't have to triage an issue with the goal of fixing it (although that would be nice too). Sharing the result of your investigation, for example the commit that led to the bug, can already save us a ton of time.\n\n### Contribute Code\nContributing bug fixes or new features is the most direct form of contribution you can make.\n\nThe Vue core repository provides a [contributing guide](https://github.com/vuejs/core/blob/main/.github/contributing.md), which contains pull request guidelines and information regarding build setup and high-level architecture. Other sub-project repositories may also contain its own contribution guide - please make sure to read them before submitting pull requests.\n\nBug fixes are welcome at any time. For new features, it is best to discuss the use case and implementation details first in the [RFC repo](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/discussions).\n\n### Share (and Build) Your Experience\nApart from answering questions and sharing resources in the forum and chat, there are a few other less obvious ways to share and expand what you know:\n- **Develop learning materials.** It's often said that the best way to learn is to teach. If there's something interesting you're doing with Vue, strengthen your expertise by writing a blog post, developing a workshop, or even publishing a gist that you share on social media.\n- **Watch a repo you care about.** This will send you notifications whenever there's activity in that repository, giving you insider knowledge about ongoing discussions and upcoming features. It's a fantastic way to build expertise so that you're eventually able to help address issues and pull requests.\n\n### Translate Docs\nI hope that right now, you're reading this sentence in your preferred language. If not, would you like to help us get there?\n\nSee the [Translations guide](https://vuejs.org/translations/) for more details on how you can get involved.\n\n### Become a Community Leader\nThere's a lot you can do to help Vue grow in your community:\n- **Present at your local meetup.** Whether it's giving a talk or running a workshop, you can bring a lot of value to your community by helping both new and experienced Vue developers continue to grow.\n- **Start your own meetup.** If there's not already a Vue meetup in your area, you can start your own! Use the [resources at events.vuejs.org](https://events.vuejs.org/resources/#getting-started) to help you succeed!\n- **Help meetup organizers.** There can never be too much help when it comes to running an event, so offer a hand to help out local organizers to help make every event a success.\n\nIf you have any questions on how you can get more involved with your local Vue community, reach out on Twitter at [@vuejs_events](https://www.twitter.com/vuejs_events)!.\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://vuejs.org/about/community-guide.html", "title": "Community Guide", "description": "Vue's community is growing incredibly fast and if you're reading this, there's a good chance you're ready to join it.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful vue-about expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Frequently Asked Questions is in vue-about?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Frequently Asked Questions in vue-about.\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n\nThis page provides answers to common questions about Vue, including its maintenance, version differences, support, licensing, performance, and more.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Who maintains Vue?\n\nVue is an independent, community-driven project. It was created by Evan You in 2014 as a personal side project. Today, Vue is actively maintained by a team of both full-time and volunteer members from all around the world, where Evan serves as the project lead. You can learn more about the story of Vue in this documentary.\n\nVue's development is primarily funded through sponsorships and we have been financially sustainable since 2016. If you or your business benefit from Vue, consider sponsoring us to support Vue's development!\n\n## What's the difference between Vue 2 and Vue 3?\n\nVue 3 is the current, latest major version of Vue. It contains new features that are not present in Vue 2, such as Teleport, Suspense, and multiple root elements per template. It also contains breaking changes that make it incompatible with Vue 2. Full details are documented in the Vue 3 Migration Guide.\n\nDespite the differences, the majority of Vue APIs are shared between the two major versions, so most of your Vue 2 knowledge will continue to work in Vue 3. Notably, Composition API was originally a Vue-3-only feature, but has now been backported to Vue 2 and is available in Vue 2.7.\n\nIn general, Vue 3 provides smaller bundle sizes, better performance, better scalability, and better TypeScript / IDE support. If you are starting a new project today, Vue 3 is the recommended choice. There are only a few reasons for you to consider Vue 2 as of now:\n\n- You need to support IE11. Vue 3 leverages modern JavaScript features and does not support IE11.\n\nIf you intend to migrate an existing Vue 2 app to Vue 3, consult the migration guide.\n\n## Is Vue 2 Still Supported?\n\nVue 2.7, which was shipped in July 2022, is the final minor release of the Vue 2 version range. Vue 2 has now entered maintenance mode: it will no longer ship new features, but will continue to receive critical bug fixes and security updates for 18 months starting from the 2.7 release date. This means **Vue 2 will reach End of Life on December 31st, 2023**.\n\nWe believe this should provide plenty of time for most of the ecosystem to migrate over to Vue 3. However, we also understand that there could be teams or projects that cannot upgrade by this timeline while still needing to fulfill security and compliance requirements. We are partnering with industry experts to provide extended support for Vue 2 for teams with such needs - if your team expects to be using Vue 2 beyond the end of 2023, make sure to plan ahead and learn more about Vue 2 Extended LTS.\n\n## What license does Vue use?\n\nVue is a free and open source project released under the MIT License.\n\n## What browsers does Vue support?\n\nThe latest version of Vue (3.x) only supports browsers with native ES2016 support. This excludes IE11. Vue 3.x uses ES2016 features that cannot be polyfilled in legacy browsers, so if you need to support legacy browsers, you will need to use Vue 2.x instead.\n\n## Is Vue reliable?\n\nVue is a mature and battle-tested framework. It is one of the most widely used JavaScript frameworks in production today, with over 1.5 million users worldwide, and is downloaded close to 10 million times a month on npm.\n\nVue is used in production by renowned organizations in varying capacities all around the world, including Wikimedia Foundation, NASA, Apple, Google, Microsoft, GitLab, Zoom, Tencent, Weibo, Bilibili, Kuaishou, and many more.\n\n## Is Vue fast?\n\nVue 3 is one of the most performant mainstream frontend frameworks, and handles most web application use cases with ease, without the need for manual optimizations.\n\nIn stress-testing scenarios, Vue outperforms React and Angular by a decent margin in the js-framework-benchmark. It also goes neck-and-neck against some of the fastest production-level non-Virtual-DOM frameworks in the benchmark.\n\nDo note that synthetic benchmarks like the above focus on raw rendering performance with dedicated optimizations and may not be fully representative of real-world performance results. If you care more about page load performance, you are welcome to audit this very website using WebPageTest or PageSpeed Insights. This website is powered by Vue itself, with SSG pre-rendering, full page hydration and SPA client-side navigation. It scores 100 in performance on an emulated Moto G4 with 4x CPU throttling over slow 4G networks.\n\nYou can learn more about how Vue automatically optimizes runtime performance in the Rendering Mechanism section, and how to optimize a Vue app in particularly demanding cases in the Performance Optimization Guide.\n\n## Is Vue lightweight?\n\nWhen you use a build tool, many of Vue's APIs are \"tree-shakable\". For example, if you don't use the built-in <Transition> component, it won't be included in the final production bundle.\n\nA hello world Vue app that only uses the absolutely minimal APIs has a baseline size of only around **16kb**, with minification and brotli compression. The actual size of the application will depend on how many optional features you use from the framework. In the unlikely case where an app uses every single feature that Vue provides, the total runtime size is around **27kb**.\n\nWhen using Vue without a build tool, we not only lose tree-shaking, but also have to ship the template compiler to the browser. This bloats up the size to around **41kb**. Therefore, if you are using Vue primarily for progressive enhancement without a build step, consider using petite-vue (only **6kb**) instead.\n\nSome frameworks, such as Svelte, use a compilation strategy that produces extremely lightweight output in single-component scenarios. However, our research shows that the size difference heavily depends on the number of components in the application. While Vue has a heavier baseline size, it generates less code per component. In real-world scenarios, a Vue app may very well end up being lighter.\n\n## Does Vue scale?\n\nYes. Despite a common misconception that Vue is only suitable for simple use cases, Vue is perfectly capable of handling large scale applications:\n\n- Single-File Components provide a modularized development model that allows different parts of an application to be developed in isolation.\n\n- Composition API provides first-class TypeScript integration and enables clean patterns for organizing, extracting and reusing complex logic.\n\n- Comprehensive tooling support ensures a smooth development experience as the application grows.\n\n- Lower barrier to entry and excellent documentation translate to lower onboarding and training costs for new developers.\n\n## How do I contribute to Vue?\n\nWe appreciate your interest! Please check out our Community Guide.\n\n## Should I use Options API or Composition API?\n\nIf you are new to Vue, we provide a high-level comparison between the two styles here.\n\nIf you have previously used Options API and are currently evaluating Composition API, check out this FAQ.\n\n## Should I use JavaScript or TypeScript with Vue?\n\nWhile Vue itself is implemented in TypeScript and provides first-class TypeScript support, it does not enforce an opinion on whether you should use TypeScript as a user.\n\nTypeScript support is an important consideration when new features are added to Vue. APIs that are designed with TypeScript in mind are typically easier for IDEs and linters to understand, even if you aren't using TypeScript yourself. Everybody wins. Vue APIs are also designed to work the same way in both JavaScript and TypeScript as much as possible.\n\nAdopting TypeScript involves a trade-off between onboarding complexity and long-term maintainability gains. Whether such a trade-off can be justified can vary depending on your team's background and project scale, but Vue isn't really an influencing factor in making that decision.\n\n## How does Vue compare to Web Components?\n\nVue was created before Web Components were natively available, and some aspects of Vue's design (e.g. slots) were inspired by the Web Components model.\n\nThe Web Components specs are relatively low-level, as they are centered around defining custom elements. As a framework, Vue addresses additional higher-level concerns such as efficient DOM rendering, reactive state management, tooling, client-side routing, and server-side rendering.\n\nVue also fully supports consuming or exporting to native custom elements - check out the Vue and Web Components Guide for more details.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://vuejs.org/about/faq.html", "title": "Frequently Asked Questions", "description": "This page provides answers to common questions about Vue, including its maintenance, version differences, support, licensing, performance, and more.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": false, "section_count": 13, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 01:01:18", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"favicon": "https://vuejs.org/logo.svg", "ogDescription": "Vue.js - The Progressive JavaScript Framework", "generator": "VitePress v1.6.3", "theme-color": "#3c8772", "og:url": "https://vuejs.org/", "og:type": "website", "ogTitle": "Vue.js", "og:title": "Vue.js", "ogImage": "https://vuejs.org/images/logo.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "og:description": "Vue.js - The Progressive JavaScript Framework", "ogUrl": "https://vuejs.org/", "language": "en-US", "description": "Vue.js - The Progressive JavaScript Framework", "og:image": "https://vuejs.org/images/logo.png", "twitter:site": "@vuejs", "twitter:card": "summary", "title": "Frequently Asked Questions | Vue.js", "scrapeId": "2e727616-c27f-407d-976f-4e3ba3d2bbc2", "sourceURL": "https://vuejs.org/about/faq.html", "url": "https://vuejs.org/about/faq.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful vue-about expert.\n\nUser: How do I is vue lightweight? in vue-about?\n\nAssistant: To is vue lightweight? in vue-about, here's what you do:\nWhen you use a build tool, many of Vue's APIs are \"tree-shakable\". For example, if you don't use the built-in <Transition> component, it won't be included in the final production bundle.\n\nA hello world Vue app that only uses the absolutely minimal APIs has a baseline size of only around **16kb**, with minification and brotli compression. The actual size of the application will depend on how many optional features you use from the framework. In the unlikely case where an app uses every single feature that Vue provides, the total runtime size is around **27kb**.\n\nWhen using Vue without a build tool, we not only lose tree-shaking, but also have to ship the template compiler to the browser. This bloats up the size to around **41kb**. Therefore, if you are using Vue primarily for progressive enhancement without a build step, consider using petite-vue (only **6kb**) instead.\n\nSome frameworks, such as Svelte, use a compilation strategy that produces extremely lightweight output in single-component scenarios. However, our research shows that the size difference heavily depends on the number of components in the application. While Vue has a heavier baseline size, it generates less code per component. In real-world scenarios, a Vue app may very well end up being lighter..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://vuejs.org/about/faq.html", "title": "Frequently Asked Questions", "description": "This page provides answers to common questions about Vue, including its maintenance, version differences, support, licensing, performance, and more.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": false, "section_count": 13, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 01:01:18", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"favicon": "https://vuejs.org/logo.svg", "ogDescription": "Vue.js - The Progressive JavaScript Framework", "generator": "VitePress v1.6.3", "theme-color": "#3c8772", "og:url": "https://vuejs.org/", "og:type": "website", "ogTitle": "Vue.js", "og:title": "Vue.js", "ogImage": "https://vuejs.org/images/logo.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "og:description": "Vue.js - The Progressive JavaScript Framework", "ogUrl": "https://vuejs.org/", "language": "en-US", "description": "Vue.js - The Progressive JavaScript Framework", "og:image": "https://vuejs.org/images/logo.png", "twitter:site": "@vuejs", "twitter:card": "summary", "title": "Frequently Asked Questions | Vue.js", "scrapeId": "2e727616-c27f-407d-976f-4e3ba3d2bbc2", "sourceURL": "https://vuejs.org/about/faq.html", "url": "https://vuejs.org/about/faq.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful vue-about expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Releases is in vue-about?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Releases in vue-about.\n\n# Releases\n\nThe current latest stable version of Vue is v3.5.13. A full changelog of past releases is available on GitHub.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Release Cycle\n\nVue does not have a fixed release cycle.\n\n- Patch releases are released as needed.\n\n- Minor releases always contain new features, with a typical time frame of 3~6 months in between. Minor releases always go through a beta pre-release phase.\n\n- Major releases will be announced ahead of time, and will go through an early discussion phase and alpha / beta pre-release phases.\n\n## Semantic Versioning Edge Cases\n\nVue releases follow Semantic Versioning with a few edge cases.\n\n## TypeScript Definitions\n\nWe may ship incompatible changes to TypeScript definitions between minor versions. This is because:\n\n1. Sometimes TypeScript itself ships incompatible changes between minor versions, and we may have to adjust types to support newer versions of TypeScript.\n\n2. Occasionally we may need to adopt features that are only available in a newer version of TypeScript, raising the minimum required version of TypeScript.\n\nIf you are using TypeScript, you can use a semver range that locks the current minor and manually upgrade when a new minor version of Vue is released.\n\n## Compiled Code Compatibility with Older Runtime\n\nA newer minor version of Vue compiler may generate code that isn't compatible with the Vue runtime from an older minor version. For example, code generated by Vue 3.2 compiler may not be fully compatible if consumed by the runtime from Vue 3.1.\n\nThis is only a concern for library authors, because in applications, the compiler version and the runtime version is always the same. A version mismatch can only happen if you ship pre-compiled Vue component code as a package, and a consumer uses it in a project using an older version of Vue. As a result, your package may need to explicitly declare a minimum required minor version of Vue.\n\n## Pre Releases\n\nMinor releases typically go through a non-fixed number of beta releases. Major releases will go through an alpha phase and a beta phase.\n\nAdditionally, we publish canary releases every week from the main and minor branches on GitHub. They are published as different packages to avoid bloating the npm metadata of the stable channel. You can install them via npx install-vue@canary or npx install-vue@canary-minor, respectively.\n\nPre-releases are meant for integration / stability testing, and for early adopters to provide feedback for unstable features. Do not use pre-releases in production. All pre-releases are considered unstable and may ship breaking changes in between, so always pin to exact versions when using pre-releases.\n\n## Deprecations\n\nWe may periodically deprecate features that have new, better replacements in minor releases. Deprecated features will continue to work, and will be removed in the next major release after it entered deprecated status.\n\n## RFCs\n\nNew features with substantial API surface and major changes to Vue will go through the Request for Comments (RFC) process. The RFC process is intended to provide a consistent and controlled path for new features to enter the framework, and give the users an opportunity to participate and offer feedback in the design process.\n\nThe RFC process is conducted in the vuejs/rfcs repo on GitHub.\n\n## Experimental Features\n\nSome features are shipped and documented in a stable version of Vue, but marked as experimental. Experimental features are typically features that have an associated RFC discussion with most of the design problems resolved on paper, but still lacking feedback from real-world usage.\n\nThe goal of experimental features is to allow users to provide feedback for them by testing them in a production setting, without having to use an unstable version of Vue. Experimental features themselves are considered unstable, and should only be used in a controlled manner, with the expectation that the feature may change between any release types.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://vuejs.org/about/releases.html", "title": "Releases", "description": "The current latest stable version of Vue is v3.5.13.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful vue-about expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Frequently Asked Questions is in vue-about?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Frequently Asked Questions in vue-about.\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n\nThis page provides answers to common questions about Vue, including its maintenance, version differences, support, performance, and more.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Who maintains Vue?\n\nVue is an independent, community-driven project. It was created by Evan You in 2014 as a personal side project. Today, Vue is actively maintained by a team of both full-time and volunteer members from all around the world, where Evan serves as the project lead. You can learn more about the story of Vue in this documentary.\n\nVue's development is primarily funded through sponsorships and we have been financially sustainable since 2016. If you or your business benefit from Vue, consider sponsoring us to support Vue's development!\n\n## What's the difference between Vue 2 and Vue 3?\n\nVue 3 is the current, latest major version of Vue. It contains new features that are not present in Vue 2, such as Teleport, Suspense, and multiple root elements per template. It also contains breaking changes that make it incompatible with Vue 2. Full details are documented in the Vue 3 Migration Guide.\n\nDespite the differences, the majority of Vue APIs are shared between the two major versions, so most of your Vue 2 knowledge will continue to work in Vue 3. Notably, Composition API was originally a Vue-3-only feature, but has now been backported to Vue 2 and is available in Vue 2.7.\n\nIn general, Vue 3 provides smaller bundle sizes, better performance, better scalability, and better TypeScript / IDE support. If you are starting a new project today, Vue 3 is the recommended choice. There are only a few reasons for you to consider Vue 2 as of now:\n\n- You need to support IE11. Vue 3 leverages modern JavaScript features and does not support IE11.\n\nIf you intend to migrate an existing Vue 2 app to Vue 3, consult the migration guide.\n\n## Is Vue 2 Still Supported?\n\nVue 2.7, which was shipped in July 2022, is the final minor release of the Vue 2 version range. Vue 2 has now entered maintenance mode: it will no longer ship new features, but will continue to receive critical bug fixes and security updates for 18 months starting from the 2.7 release date. This means **Vue 2 will reach End of Life on December 31st, 2023**.\n\nWe believe this should provide plenty of time for most of the ecosystem to migrate over to Vue 3. However, we also understand that there could be teams or projects that cannot upgrade by this timeline while still needing to fulfill security and compliance requirements. We are partnering with industry experts to provide extended support for Vue 2 for teams with such needs - if your team expects to be using Vue 2 beyond the end of 2023, make sure to plan ahead and learn more about Vue 2 Extended LTS.\n\n## What license does Vue use?\n\nVue is a free and open source project released under the MIT License.\n\n## What browsers does Vue support?\n\nThe latest version of Vue (3.x) only supports browsers with native ES2016 support. This excludes IE11. Vue 3.x uses ES2016 features that cannot be polyfilled in legacy browsers, so if you need to support legacy browsers, you will need to use Vue 2.x instead.\n\n## Is Vue reliable?\n\nVue is a mature and battle-tested framework. It is one of the most widely used JavaScript frameworks in production today, with over 1.5 million users worldwide, and is downloaded close to 10 million times a month on npm.\n\nVue is used in production by renowned organizations in varying capacities all around the world, including Wikimedia Foundation, NASA, Apple, Google, Microsoft, GitLab, Zoom, Tencent, Weibo, Bilibili, Kuaishou, and many more.\n\n## Is Vue fast?\n\nVue 3 is one of the most performant mainstream frontend frameworks, and handles most web application use cases with ease, without the need for manual optimizations.\n\nIn stress-testing scenarios, Vue outperforms React and Angular by a decent margin in the js-framework-benchmark. It also goes neck-and-neck against some of the fastest production-level non-Virtual-DOM frameworks in the benchmark.\n\nDo note that synthetic benchmarks like the above focus on raw rendering performance with dedicated optimizations and may not be fully representative of real-world performance results. If you care more about page load performance, you are welcome to audit this very website using WebPageTest or PageSpeed Insights. This website is powered by Vue itself, with SSG pre-rendering, full page hydration and SPA client-side navigation. It scores 100 in performance on an emulated Moto G4 with 4x CPU throttling over slow 4G networks.\n\nYou can learn more about how Vue automatically optimizes runtime performance in the Rendering Mechanism section, and how to optimize a Vue app in particularly demanding cases in the Performance Optimization Guide.\n\n## Is Vue lightweight?\n\nWhen you use a build tool, many of Vue's APIs are \"tree-shakable\". For example, if you don't use the built-in <Transition> component, it won't be included in the final production bundle.\n\nA hello world Vue app that only uses the absolutely minimal APIs has a baseline size of only around **16kb**, with minification and brotli compression. The actual size of the application will depend on how many optional features you use from the framework. In the unlikely case where an app uses every single feature that Vue provides, the total runtime size is around **27kb**.\n\nWhen using Vue without a build tool, we not only lose tree-shaking, but also have to ship the template compiler to the browser. This bloats up the size to around **41kb**. Therefore, if you are using Vue primarily for progressive enhancement without a build step, consider using petite-vue (only **6kb**) instead.\n\nSome frameworks, such as Svelte, use a compilation strategy that produces extremely lightweight output in single-component scenarios. However, our research shows that the size difference heavily depends on the number of components in the application. While Vue has a heavier baseline size, it generates less code per component. In real-world scenarios, a Vue app may very well end up being lighter.\n\n## Does Vue scale?\n\nYes. Despite a common misconception that Vue is only suitable for simple use cases, Vue is perfectly capable of handling large scale applications:\n\n- Single-File Components provide a modularized development model that allows different parts of an application to be developed in isolation.\n\n- Composition API provides first-class TypeScript integration and enables clean patterns for organizing, extracting and reusing complex logic.\n\n- Comprehensive tooling support ensures a smooth development experience as the application grows.\n\n- Lower barrier to entry and excellent documentation translate to lower onboarding and training costs for new developers.\n\n## How do I contribute to Vue?\n\nWe appreciate your interest! Please check out our Community Guide.\n\n## Should I use Options API or Composition API?\n\nIf you are new to Vue, we provide a high-level comparison between the two styles here.\n\nIf you have previously used Options API and are currently evaluating Composition API, check out this FAQ.\n\n## Should I use JavaScript or TypeScript with Vue?\n\nWhile Vue itself is implemented in TypeScript and provides first-class TypeScript support, it does not enforce an opinion on whether you should use TypeScript as a user.\n\nTypeScript support is an important consideration when new features are added to Vue. APIs that are designed with TypeScript in mind are typically easier for IDEs and linters to understand, even if you aren't using TypeScript yourself. Everybody wins. Vue APIs are also designed to work the same way in both JavaScript and TypeScript as much as possible.\n\nAdopting TypeScript involves a trade-off between onboarding complexity and long-term maintainability gains. Whether such a trade-off can be justified can vary depending on your team's background and project scale, but Vue isn't really an influencing factor in making that decision.\n\n## How does Vue compare to Web Components?\n\nVue was created before Web Components were natively available, and some aspects of Vue's design (e.g. slots) were inspired by the Web Components model.\n\nThe Web Components specs are relatively low-level, as they are centered around defining custom elements. As a framework, Vue addresses additional higher-level concerns such as efficient DOM rendering, reactive state management, tooling, client-side routing, and server-side rendering.\n\nVue also fully supports consuming or exporting to native custom elements - check out the Vue and Web Components Guide for more details.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://vuejs.org/about/faq", "title": "Frequently Asked Questions", "description": "This page provides answers to common questions about Vue, including its maintenance, version differences, support, performance, and more.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": false, "section_count": 13, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 01:06:14", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"generator": "VitePress v1.6.3", "og:url": "https://vuejs.org/", "og:type": "website", "og:image": "https://vuejs.org/images/logo.png", "twitter:site": "@vuejs", "description": "Vue.js - The Progressive JavaScript Framework", "ogImage": "https://vuejs.org/images/logo.png", "favicon": "https://vuejs.org/logo.svg", "ogTitle": "Vue.js", "theme-color": "#3c8772", "ogDescription": "Vue.js - The Progressive JavaScript Framework", "twitter:card": "summary", "ogUrl": "https://vuejs.org/", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "og:title": "Vue.js", "title": "Frequently Asked Questions | Vue.js", "language": "en-US", "og:description": "Vue.js - The Progressive JavaScript Framework", "scrapeId": "ad4017cb-030d-4c36-9345-867a68b4d13d", "sourceURL": "https://vuejs.org/about/faq", "url": "https://vuejs.org/about/faq", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful vue-about expert.\n\nUser: How do I is vue lightweight? in vue-about?\n\nAssistant: To is vue lightweight? in vue-about, here's what you do:\nWhen you use a build tool, many of Vue's APIs are \"tree-shakable\". For example, if you don't use the built-in <Transition> component, it won't be included in the final production bundle.\n\nA hello world Vue app that only uses the absolutely minimal APIs has a baseline size of only around **16kb**, with minification and brotli compression. The actual size of the application will depend on how many optional features you use from the framework. In the unlikely case where an app uses every single feature that Vue provides, the total runtime size is around **27kb**.\n\nWhen using Vue without a build tool, we not only lose tree-shaking, but also have to ship the template compiler to the browser. This bloats up the size to around **41kb**. Therefore, if you are using Vue primarily for progressive enhancement without a build step, consider using petite-vue (only **6kb**) instead.\n\nSome frameworks, such as Svelte, use a compilation strategy that produces extremely lightweight output in single-component scenarios. However, our research shows that the size difference heavily depends on the number of components in the application. While Vue has a heavier baseline size, it generates less code per component. In real-world scenarios, a Vue app may very well end up being lighter..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://vuejs.org/about/faq", "title": "Frequently Asked Questions", "description": "This page provides answers to common questions about Vue, including its maintenance, version differences, support, performance, and more.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": false, "section_count": 13, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 01:06:14", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"generator": "VitePress v1.6.3", "og:url": "https://vuejs.org/", "og:type": "website", "og:image": "https://vuejs.org/images/logo.png", "twitter:site": "@vuejs", "description": "Vue.js - The Progressive JavaScript Framework", "ogImage": "https://vuejs.org/images/logo.png", "favicon": "https://vuejs.org/logo.svg", "ogTitle": "Vue.js", "theme-color": "#3c8772", "ogDescription": "Vue.js - The Progressive JavaScript Framework", "twitter:card": "summary", "ogUrl": "https://vuejs.org/", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "og:title": "Vue.js", "title": "Frequently Asked Questions | Vue.js", "language": "en-US", "og:description": "Vue.js - The Progressive JavaScript Framework", "scrapeId": "ad4017cb-030d-4c36-9345-867a68b4d13d", "sourceURL": "https://vuejs.org/about/faq", "url": "https://vuejs.org/about/faq", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful vue-about expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Releases is in vue-about?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Releases in vue-about.\n\n# Releases\n\nThe current latest stable version of Vue is v3.5.13. A full changelog of past releases is available on GitHub.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Release Cycle\n\nVue does not have a fixed release cycle.\n\n- Patch releases are released as needed.\n\n- Minor releases always contain new features, with a typical time frame of 3~6 months in between. Minor releases always go through a beta pre-release phase.\n\n- Major releases will be announced ahead of time, and will go through an early discussion phase and alpha / beta pre-release phases.\n\n## Semantic Versioning Edge Cases\n\nVue releases follow Semantic Versioning with a few edge cases.\n\n## TypeScript Definitions\n\nWe may ship incompatible changes to TypeScript definitions between minor versions. This is because:\n\n1. Sometimes TypeScript itself ships incompatible changes between minor versions, and we may have to adjust types to support newer versions of TypeScript.\n\n2. Occasionally we may need to adopt features that are only available in a newer version of TypeScript, raising the minimum required version of TypeScript.\n\nIf you are using TypeScript, you can use a semver range that locks the current minor and manually upgrade when a new minor version of Vue is released.\n\n## Compiled Code Compatibility with Older Runtime\n\nA newer minor version of Vue compiler may generate code that isn't compatible with the Vue runtime from an older minor version. For example, code generated by Vue 3.2 compiler may not be fully compatible if consumed by the runtime from Vue 3.1.\n\nThis is only a concern for library authors, because in applications, the compiler version and the runtime version is always the same. A version mismatch can only happen if you ship pre-compiled Vue component code as a package, and a consumer uses it in a project using an older version of Vue. As a result, your package may need to explicitly declare a minimum required minor version of Vue.\n\n## Pre Releases\n\nMinor releases typically go through a non-fixed number of beta releases. Major releases will go through an alpha phase and a beta phase.\n\nAdditionally, we publish canary releases every week from the main and minor branches on GitHub. They are published as different packages to avoid bloating the npm metadata of the stable channel. You can install them via npx install-vue@canary or npx install-vue@canary-minor, respectively.\n\nPre-releases are meant for integration / stability testing, and for early adopters to provide feedback for unstable features. Do not use pre-releases in production. All pre-releases are considered unstable and may ship breaking changes in between, so always pin to exact versions when using pre-releases.\n\n## Deprecations\n\nWe may periodically deprecate features that have new, better replacements in minor releases. Deprecated features will continue to work, and will be removed in the next major release after it entered deprecated status.\n\n## RFCs\n\nNew features with substantial API surface and major changes to Vue will go through the Request for Comments (RFC) process. The RFC process is intended to provide a consistent and controlled path for new features to enter the framework, and give the users an opportunity to participate and offer feedback in the design process.\n\nThe RFC process is conducted in the vuejs/rfcs repo on GitHub.\n\n## Experimental Features\n\nSome features are shipped and documented in a stable version of Vue, but marked as experimental. Experimental features are typically features that have an associated RFC discussion with most of the design problems resolved on paper, but still lacking feedback from real-world usage.\n\nThe goal of experimental features is to allow users to provide feedback for them by testing them in a production setting, without having to use an unstable version of Vue. Experimental features themselves are considered unstable, and should only be used in a controlled manner, with the expectation that the feature may change between any release types.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://vuejs.org/about/releases", "title": "Releases", "description": "The current latest stable version of Vue is v3.5.13.

Occasionally we may need to adopt features that are only available in a newer version of TypeScript, raising the minimum required version of TypeScript.\n\nIf you are using TypeScript, you can use a semver range that locks the current minor and manually upgrade when a new minor version of Vue is released..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://vuejs.org/about/releases", "title": "Releases", "description": "The current latest stable version of Vue is v3.5.13.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful vue-about expert.\n\nUser: How do I compiled code compatibility with older runtime in vue-about?\n\nAssistant: To compiled code compatibility with older runtime in vue-about, here's what you do:\nA newer minor version of Vue compiler may generate code that isn't compatible with the Vue runtime from an older minor version. For example, code generated by Vue 3.2 compiler may not be fully compatible if consumed by the runtime from Vue 3.1.\n\nThis is only a concern for library authors, because in applications, the compiler version and the runtime version is always the same. A version mismatch can only happen if you ship pre-compiled Vue component code as a package, and a consumer uses it in a project using an older version of Vue. As a result, your package may need to explicitly declare a minimum required minor version of Vue..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://vuejs.org/about/releases", "title": "Releases", "description": "The current latest stable version of Vue is v3.5.13.

Major releases will go through an alpha phase and a beta phase.\n\nAdditionally, we publish canary releases every week from the main and minor branches on GitHub. They are published as different packages to avoid bloating the npm metadata of the stable channel. You can install them via npx install-vue@canary or npx install-vue@canary-minor, respectively.\n\nPre-releases are meant for integration / stability testing, and for early adopters to provide feedback for unstable features. Do not use pre-releases in production. All pre-releases are considered unstable and may ship breaking changes in between, so always pin to exact versions when using pre-releases..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://vuejs.org/about/releases", "title": "Releases", "description": "The current latest stable version of Vue is v3.5.13.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful vue-about expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Code Of Conduct is in vue-about?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Code Of Conduct in vue-about.\n\n# Code Of Conduct\n\nThis document outlines the Code of Conduct for contributors and maintainers of the Vue.js project, detailing pledges, standards, responsibilities, scope, enforcement, and attribution.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Our Pledge\n\nIn the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, political party, or sexual identity and orientation. Note, however, that religion, political party, or other ideological affiliation provide no exemptions for the behavior we outline as unacceptable in this Code of Conduct.\n\n## Our Standards\n\nExamples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:\n\n- Using welcoming and inclusive language\n- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences\n- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism\n- Focusing on what is best for the community\n- Showing empathy towards other community members\n\nExamples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:\n\n- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances\n- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks\n- Public or private harassment\n- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission\n- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.\n\n## Our Responsibilities\n\nProject maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.\n\nProject maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.\n\n## Scope\n\nThis Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.\n\n## Enforcement\n\nInstances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at community@vuejs.org. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.\n\nProject maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.4, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html\n\nFor answers to common questions about this code of conduct, see https://www.contributor-covenant.org/faq\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://vuejs.org/about/coc", "title": "Code Of Conduct", "description": "This document outlines the Code of Conduct for contributors and maintainers of the Vue.js project, detailing pledges, standards, responsibilities, scope, enforcement, and attribution.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": false, "section_count": 6, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 01:09:51", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"ogTitle": "Vue.js", "og:url": "https://vuejs.org/", "generator": "VitePress v1.6.3", "og:type": "website", "og:description": "Vue.js - The Progressive JavaScript Framework", "title": "Code Of Conduct | Vue.js", "ogDescription": "Vue.js - The Progressive JavaScript Framework", "og:image": "https://vuejs.org/images/logo.png", "favicon": "https://vuejs.org/logo.svg", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "twitter:site": "@vuejs", "language": "en-US", "ogImage": "https://vuejs.org/images/logo.png", "og:title": "Vue.js", "twitter:card": "summary", "ogUrl": "https://vuejs.org/", "description": "Vue.js - The Progressive JavaScript Framework", "theme-color": "#3c8772", "scrapeId": "cc057d4a-e516-41b0-b776-18df7b256909", "sourceURL": "https://vuejs.org/about/coc", "url": "https://vuejs.org/about/coc", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful vue-about expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Community Guide is in vue-about?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Community Guide in vue-about.\n\n# Community Guide\n\nVue's community is growing incredibly fast and if you're reading this, there's a good chance you're ready to join it. So... welcome! Now we'll answer both what the community can do for you and what you can do for the community.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Resources\n\n### Code of Conduct\nOur [Code of Conduct](https://vuejs.org/about/coc) is a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.\n\n### Stay in the Know\n- Follow our [official Twitter account](https://twitter.com/vuejs).\n- Follow our [team members](https://vuejs.org/about/team) on Twitter or GitHub.\n- Follow the [RFC discussions](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs).\n- Subscribe to the [official blog](https://blog.vuejs.org/).\n\n### Get Support\n- [Discord Chat](https://discord.com/invite/vue): A place for Vue devs to meet and chat in real time.\n- [Forum](https://forum.vuejs.org/): The best place to ask questions and get answers about Vue and its ecosystem.\n- [DEV Community](https://dev.to/t/vue): Share and discuss Vue related topics on Dev.to.\n- [Meetups](https://events.vuejs.org/meetups): Want to find local Vue enthusiasts like yourself? Interested in becoming a community leader? We have the help and support you need right here!\n- [GitHub](https://github.com/vuejs): If you have a bug to report or feature to request, that's what the GitHub issues are for. Please respect the rules specified in each repository's issue template.\n- [Twitter Community (unofficial)](https://twitter.com/i/communities/1516368750634840064): A Twitter community, where you can meet other Vue enthusiasts, get help, or just chat about Vue.\n\n### Explore the Ecosystem\n- [The Awesome Vue Page](https://github.com/vuejs/awesome-vue): See what other awesome resources have been published by other awesome people.\n- [Vue Telescope Explorer](https://vuetelescope.com/explore): Explore websites made with Vue, with insights on what framework / libraries they use.\n- [Made with Vue.js](https://madewithvuejs.com/): showcases of projects and libraries made with Vue.\n- [The \"Show and Tell\" Subforum](https://github.com/vuejs/core/discussions/categories/show-and-tell): Another great place to check out what others have built with and for the growing Vue ecosystem.\n\n## What You Can Do\n\n### Help Fellow Users\nCode contribution is not the only form of contribution to the Vue community. Answering a question for a fellow Vue user on Discord or the forum is also considered a valuable contribution.\n\n### Help Triage Issues\nTriaging an issue means gathering missing information, running the reproduction, verifying the issue's validity, and investigating the cause of the issue.\n\nWe receive many issues in [our repositories on GitHub](https://github.com/vuejs) every single day. Our bandwidth is limited compared to the amount of users we have, so issue triaging alone can take an enormous amount of effort from the team. By helping us triage the issues, you are helping us become more efficient, allowing us to spend time on higher priority work.\n\nYou don't have to triage an issue with the goal of fixing it (although that would be nice too). Sharing the result of your investigation, for example the commit that led to the bug, can already save us a ton of time.\n\n### Contribute Code\nContributing bug fixes or new features is the most direct form of contribution you can make.\n\nThe Vue core repository provides a [contributing guide](https://github.com/vuejs/core/blob/main/.github/contributing.md), which contains pull request guidelines and information regarding build setup and high-level architecture. Other sub-project repositories may also contain its own contribution guide - please make sure to read them before submitting pull requests.\n\nBug fixes are welcome at any time. For new features, it is best to discuss the use case and implementation details first in the [RFC repo](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/discussions).\n\n### Share (and Build) Your Experience\nApart from answering questions and sharing resources in the forum and chat, there are a few other less obvious ways to share and expand what you know:\n- **Develop learning materials.** It's often said that the best way to learn is to teach. If there's something interesting you're doing with Vue, strengthen your expertise by writing a blog post, developing a workshop, or even publishing a gist that you share on social media.\n- **Watch a repo you care about.** This will send you notifications whenever there's activity in that repository, giving you insider knowledge about ongoing discussions and upcoming features. It's a fantastic way to build expertise so that you're eventually able to help address issues and pull requests.\n\n### Translate Docs\nI hope that right now, you're reading this sentence in your preferred language. If not, would you like to help us get there?\n\nSee the [Translations guide](https://vuejs.org/translations/) for more details on how you can get involved.\n\n### Become a Community Leader\nThere's a lot you can do to help Vue grow in your community:\n- **Present at your local meetup.** Whether it's giving a talk or running a workshop, you can bring a lot of value to your community by helping both new and experienced Vue developers continue to grow.\n- **Start your own meetup.** If there's not already a Vue meetup in your area, you can start your own!

{"text": "System: You are a helpful vue-about expert.\n\nUser: How do I what you can do in vue-about?\n\nAssistant: To what you can do in vue-about, here's what you do:\n### Help Fellow Users\nCode contribution is not the only form of contribution to the Vue community. Answering a question for a fellow Vue user on Discord or the forum is also considered a valuable contribution.\n\n### Help Triage Issues\nTriaging an issue means gathering missing information, running the reproduction, verifying the issue's validity, and investigating the cause of the issue.\n\nWe receive many issues in [our repositories on GitHub](https://github.com/vuejs) every single day. Our bandwidth is limited compared to the amount of users we have, so issue triaging alone can take an enormous amount of effort from the team. By helping us triage the issues, you are helping us become more efficient, allowing us to spend time on higher priority work.\n\nYou don't have to triage an issue with the goal of fixing it (although that would be nice too). Sharing the result of your investigation, for example the commit that led to the bug, can already save us a ton of time.\n\n### Contribute Code\nContributing bug fixes or new features is the most direct form of contribution you can make.\n\nThe Vue core repository provides a [contributing guide](https://github.com/vuejs/core/blob/main/.github/contributing.md), which contains pull request guidelines and information regarding build setup and high-level architecture. Other sub-project repositories may also contain its own contribution guide - please make sure to read them before submitting pull requests.\n\nBug fixes are welcome at any time. For new features, it is best to discuss the use case and implementation details first in the [RFC repo](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/discussions).\n\n### Share (and Build) Your Experience\nApart from answering questions and sharing resources in the forum and chat, there are a few other less obvious ways to share and expand what you know:\n- **Develop learning materials.** It's often said that the best way to learn is to teach. If there's something interesting you're doing with Vue, strengthen your expertise by writing a blog post, developing a workshop, or even publishing a gist that you share on social media.\n- **Watch a repo you care about.** This will send you notifications whenever there's activity in that repository, giving you insider knowledge about ongoing discussions and upcoming features. It's a fantastic way to build expertise so that you're eventually able to help address issues and pull requests.\n\n### Translate Docs\nI hope that right now, you're reading this sentence in your preferred language. If not, would you like to help us get there?\n\nSee the [Translations guide](https://vuejs.org/translations/) for more details on how you can get involved.\n\n### Become a Community Leader\nThere's a lot you can do to help Vue grow in your community:\n- **Present at your local meetup.** Whether it's giving a talk or running a workshop, you can bring a lot of value to your community by helping both new and experienced Vue developers continue to grow.\n- **Start your own meetup.** If there's not already a Vue meetup in your area, you can start your own! Use the [resources at events.vuejs.org](https://events.vuejs.org/resources/#getting-started) to help you succeed!\n- **Help meetup organizers.** There can never be too much help when it comes to running an event, so offer a hand to help out local organizers to help make every event a success.\n\nIf you have any questions on how you can get more involved with your local Vue community, reach out on Twitter at [@vuejs_events](https://www.twitter.com/vuejs_events)!.\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://vuejs.org/about/community-guide", "title": "Community Guide", "description": "Vue's community is growing incredibly fast and if you're reading this, there's a good chance you're ready to join it.
