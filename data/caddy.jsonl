If a connection is received via Unix socket, it's trusted. Otherwise, it's checked against the Allow/Deny lists, then it's handled by the FallbackPolicy.\n\nIt must be loaded before the `tls` listener because the PROXY protocol encapsulates the TLS data.\n\nCredit goes to [https://github.com/mastercactapus/caddy2-proxyprotocol](https://github.com/mastercactapus/caddy2-proxyprotocol) for having initially implemented this as a plugin.\n\n## Field List\n\n[🔗](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/caddy.listeners.proxy_protocol#timeout) timeout\n\nTimeout specifies an optional maximum time for the PROXY header to be received. If zero, timeout is disabled. Default is 5s.\n\nDuration can be an integer or a string. An integer is interpreted as nanoseconds. If a string, it is a Go time.Duration value such as `300ms`, `1.5h`, or `2h45m`; valid units are `ns`, `us`/ `µs`, `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`, and `d`.\n\n[🔗](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/caddy.listeners.proxy_protocol#allow) allow\n\nAllow is an optional list of CIDR ranges to allow/require PROXY headers from.\n\n[🔗](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/caddy.listeners.proxy_protocol#deny) deny\n\nDeny is an optional list of CIDR ranges to deny PROXY headers from.\n\n[🔗](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/caddy.listeners.proxy_protocol#fallback_policy) fallback_policy\n\nFallbackPolicy specifies the policy to use if the downstream IP address is not in the Allow list nor is in the Deny list.\n\nNOTE: The generated docs which describe the value of this field is wrong because of how this type unmarshals JSON in a custom way.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful caddy expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Reverse proxy quick-start is in caddy?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Reverse proxy quick-start in caddy.\n\n# Reverse proxy quick-start\n\nThis guide will show you how to get a production-ready reverse proxy with or without HTTPS up and running quickly.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- Basic terminal / command line skills\n- `caddy` in your PATH\n- A running backend process to proxy to\n\n## Command line\n\nTo start a plaintext HTTP proxy from port 2080 to port 9000 on your machine:\n\n```cmd bash\ncaddy reverse-proxy --from :2080 --to :9000\n```\n\nThen try it:\n\n```cmd bash\ncurl -v 127.0.0.1:2080\n```\n\nThe [`reverse-proxy` command](https://caddyserver.com/docs/command-line#reverse-proxy) is intended for quick and easy reverse proxies. (You can use it in production if your requirements are simple.)\n\n## Caddyfile\n\nIn the current working directory, create a file called `Caddyfile` with these contents:\n\n```\n:2080\n\nreverse_proxy :9000\n```\n\nThat config file is roughly equivalent to the `caddy reverse-proxy` command above.\n\nThen, from the same directory, run:\n\n```cmd bash\ncaddy run\n```\n\nThen try your proxy:\n\n```cmd bash\ncurl -v 127.0.0.1:2080\n```\n\nIf you change the Caddyfile, make sure to [reload](https://caddyserver.com/docs/command-line#caddy-reload) Caddy.\n\nThis was a simple example. You can do a lot more with the [`reverse_proxy` directive](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/directives/reverse_proxy).\n\n## HTTPS from client to proxy\n\nCaddy will serve your proxy over [HTTPS automatically and by default](https://caddyserver.com/docs/automatic-https) if it knows the hostname (domain name). The `caddy reverse-proxy` command will default to `localhost` if you omit the `--from` flag, or you can replace the first line of your Caddyfile with the domain name of the proxy.\n\n- If you use `localhost` or any domain ending in `.localhost`, Caddy will use an auto-renewing self-signed certificate. The first time you do this, you may need to enter a password as Caddy attempts to install its CA's root certificate into your trust store.\n- If you use any other domain name, Caddy will attempt to get a publicly-trusted certificate; make sure your DNS records point to your machine and that ports 80 and 443 are open to the public and directed toward Caddy.\n\nIf you don't specify a port, Caddy defaults to 443 for HTTPS. In that case you will also need permission to bind to low ports. A couple ways to do this on Linux:\n\n- Run as root (e.g. `sudo -E`).\n- Or run `sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep $(which caddy)` to give Caddy this specific capability.\n\nHere's the most basic `caddy reverse-proxy` command that gives you HTTPS:\n\n```cmd bash\ncaddy reverse-proxy --to :9000\n```\n\nThen try it:\n\n```cmd bash\ncurl -v https://localhost\n```\n\nYou can customize the hostname using the `--from` flag:\n\n```cmd bash\ncaddy reverse-proxy --from example.com --to :9000\n```\n\nIf you don't have permission to bind to low ports, you can proxy from a higher port:\n\n```cmd bash\ncaddy reverse-proxy --from example.com:8443 --to :9000\n```\n\nIf you're using a Caddyfile, simply change the first line to your domain name, for example:\n\n```\nexample.com\n\nreverse_proxy :9000\n```\n\n## HTTPS from proxy to backend\n\nCaddy can also proxy using HTTPS between itself and the backend if the backend supports TLS. Just use `https://` in your backend address:\n\n```cmd bash\ncaddy reverse-proxy --from :2080 --to https://localhost:9000\n```\n\nThis requires that the backend's certificate is trusted by the system Caddy is running on. (Caddy doesn't trust self-signed certificates unless explicitly configured to do so.)\n\nOf course, you can do HTTPS on both ends too:\n\n```cmd bash\ncaddy reverse-proxy --from example.com --to https://example.com:9000\n```\n\nThis serves HTTPS from client to proxy, and from proxy to backend.\n\nIf the hostname you're proxying to is different than the one you're proxying from, you will need to use the `--change-host-header` flag:\n\n```cmd bash\ncaddy reverse-proxy \\\n\\t--from example.com \\\n\\t--to https://localhost:9000 \\\n\\t--change-host-header\n```\n\nBy default, Caddy passes all HTTP headers through unchanged, including `Host`, and Caddy derives the TLS ServerName from the Host header. The `--change-host-header` resets the Host header to that of the backend so that the TLS handshake can complete successfully. In the example above, it would be changed from `example.com` to `localhost:9000` (and `localhost` would be used in the TLS handshake).\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://caddyserver.com/docs/quick-starts/reverse-proxy", "title": "Reverse proxy quick-start", "description": "This guide will show you how to get a production-ready reverse proxy with or without HTTPS up and running quickly.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 5, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 02:53:48", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"twitter:image": "https://caddyserver.com/old/resources/images/caddy-open-graph.jpg", "author": "Caddy Web Server", "theme-color": ["#5ea9a2", "#123245", "#123245"], "og:type": "website", "ogImage": "https://caddyserver.com/old/resources/images/caddy-open-graph.jpg", "description": "Caddy is a powerful, enterprise-ready, open source web server with automatic HTTPS written in Go", "og:url": "https://caddyserver.com/", "og:description": "Caddy is a powerful, enterprise-ready, open source web server with automatic HTTPS written in Go", "og:title": "Reverse proxy quick-start - Caddy Documentation", "ogDescription": "Caddy is a powerful, enterprise-ready, open source web server with automatic HTTPS written in Go", "favicon": "https://caddyserver.com/old/resources/images/favicon.png?v=f3b6d18", "twitter:card": "summary", "og:image": "https://caddyserver.com/old/resources/images/caddy-open-graph.jpg", "ogTitle": "Reverse proxy quick-start - Caddy Documentation", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "title": "Reverse proxy quick-start — Caddy Documentation", "ogUrl": "https://caddyserver.com/", "scrapeId": "a2c2d2ac-00d6-4163-baaf-2840edd1b09c", "sourceURL": "https://caddyserver.com/docs/quick-starts/reverse-proxy", "url": "https://caddyserver.com/docs/quick-starts/reverse-proxy", "statusCode": 200}}}

A couple ways to do this on Linux:\n\n- Run as root (e.g. `sudo -E`).\n- Or run `sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep $(which caddy)` to give Caddy this specific capability.\n\nHere's the most basic `caddy reverse-proxy` command that gives you HTTPS:\n\n```cmd bash\ncaddy reverse-proxy --to :9000\n```\n\nThen try it:\n\n```cmd bash\ncurl -v https://localhost\n```\n\nYou can customize the hostname using the `--from` flag:\n\n```cmd bash\ncaddy reverse-proxy --from example.com --to :9000\n```\n\nIf you don't have permission to bind to low ports, you can proxy from a higher port:\n\n```cmd bash\ncaddy reverse-proxy --from example.com:8443 --to :9000\n```\n\nIf you're using a Caddyfile, simply change the first line to your domain name, for example:\n\n```\nexample.com\n\nreverse_proxy :9000\n```.\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://caddyserver.com/docs/quick-starts/reverse-proxy", "title": "Reverse proxy quick-start", "description": "This guide will show you how to get a production-ready reverse proxy with or without HTTPS up and running quickly.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 5, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 02:53:48", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"twitter:image": "https://caddyserver.com/old/resources/images/caddy-open-graph.jpg", "author": "Caddy Web Server", "theme-color": ["#5ea9a2", "#123245", "#123245"], "og:type": "website", "ogImage": "https://caddyserver.com/old/resources/images/caddy-open-graph.jpg", "description": "Caddy is a powerful, enterprise-ready, open source web server with automatic HTTPS written in Go", "og:url": "https://caddyserver.com/", "og:description": "Caddy is a powerful, enterprise-ready, open source web server with automatic HTTPS written in Go", "og:title": "Reverse proxy quick-start - Caddy Documentation", "ogDescription": "Caddy is a powerful, enterprise-ready, open source web server with automatic HTTPS written in Go", "favicon": "https://caddyserver.com/old/resources/images/favicon.png?v=f3b6d18", "twitter:card": "summary", "og:image": "https://caddyserver.com/old/resources/images/caddy-open-graph.jpg", "ogTitle": "Reverse proxy quick-start - Caddy Documentation", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "title": "Reverse proxy quick-start — Caddy Documentation", "ogUrl": "https://caddyserver.com/", "scrapeId": "a2c2d2ac-00d6-4163-baaf-2840edd1b09c", "sourceURL": "https://caddyserver.com/docs/quick-starts/reverse-proxy", "url": "https://caddyserver.com/docs/quick-starts/reverse-proxy", "statusCode": 200}}}
{"text": "System: You are a helpful caddy expert.\n\nUser: How do I https from proxy to backend in caddy?\n\nAssistant: To https from proxy to backend in caddy, here's what you do:\nCaddy can also proxy using HTTPS between itself and the backend if the backend supports TLS. Just use `https://` in your backend address:\n\n```cmd bash\ncaddy reverse-proxy --from :2080 --to https://localhost:9000\n```\n\nThis requires that the backend's certificate is trusted by the system Caddy is running on. (Caddy doesn't trust self-signed certificates unless explicitly configured to do so.)\n\nOf course, you can do HTTPS on both ends too:\n\n```cmd bash\ncaddy reverse-proxy --from example.com --to https://example.com:9000\n```\n\nThis serves HTTPS from client to proxy, and from proxy to backend.\n\nIf the hostname you're proxying to is different than the one you're proxying from, you will need to use the `--change-host-header` flag:\n\n```cmd bash\ncaddy reverse-proxy \\\n\\t--from example.com \\\n\\t--to https://localhost:9000 \\\n\\t--change-host-header\n```\n\nBy default, Caddy passes all HTTP headers through unchanged, including `Host`, and Caddy derives the TLS ServerName from the Host header. The `--change-host-header` resets the Host header to that of the backend so that the TLS handshake can complete successfully. In the example above, it would be changed from `example.com` to `localhost:9000` (and `localhost` would be used in the TLS handshake)..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://caddyserver.com/docs/quick-starts/reverse-proxy", "title": "Reverse proxy quick-start", "description": "This guide will show you how to get a production-ready reverse proxy with or without HTTPS up and running quickly.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 5, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 02:53:48", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"twitter:image": "https://caddyserver.com/old/resources/images/caddy-open-graph.jpg", "author": "Caddy Web Server", "theme-color": ["#5ea9a2", "#123245", "#123245"], "og:type": "website", "ogImage": "https://caddyserver.com/old/resources/images/caddy-open-graph.jpg", "description": "Caddy is a powerful, enterprise-ready, open source web server with automatic HTTPS written in Go", "og:url": "https://caddyserver.com/", "og:description": "Caddy is a powerful, enterprise-ready, open source web server with automatic HTTPS written in Go", "og:title": "Reverse proxy quick-start - Caddy Documentation", "ogDescription": "Caddy is a powerful, enterprise-ready, open source web server with automatic HTTPS written in Go", "favicon": "https://caddyserver.com/old/resources/images/favicon.png?v=f3b6d18", "twitter:card": "summary", "og:image": "https://caddyserver.com/old/resources/images/caddy-open-graph.jpg", "ogTitle": "Reverse proxy quick-start - Caddy Documentation", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "title": "Reverse proxy quick-start — Caddy Documentation", "ogUrl": "https://caddyserver.com/", "scrapeId": "a2c2d2ac-00d6-4163-baaf-2840edd1b09c", "sourceURL": "https://caddyserver.com/docs/quick-starts/reverse-proxy", "url": "https://caddyserver.com/docs/quick-starts/reverse-proxy", "statusCode": 200}}}

For example, the eTLD of `sub.example.com` is `com`, and the eTLD of `foo.bar.com.au` is `com.au`. Privately-managed endings are NOT matched by this placeholder, so `foo.blogspot.com` would return `com`, not `blogspot.com` even though `blogspot.com` is on the PSL.\n- **`.domain_suffix`** is the same as the `.public_suffix` placeholder ending, except that it doesn't discriminate ICANN-managed labels. In other words, in `foo.blogspot.com`, this one would return `blogspot.com`.\n- **`.registered_domain`** returns the \"Effective TLD+1\" or \"eTLD+1\", using only ICANN-managed labels as the authority. For example, in `sub.example.com`, the registered domain is `example.com` because the public suffix is `com`. In `sub.example.co.uk`, the registered domain is `example.co.uk` because the public suffix is `co.uk`. In `foo.blogspot.com`, the registered domain is `blogspot.com` even though `blogspot.com` is itself on the PSL; this is because `blogspot.com` is privately-managed, not an ICANN suffix.\n- **`.public_registered_domain`** is the same as the `.registered_domain` placeholder, except that it only returns a value if the suffix is an ICANN ending. In other words, it returns the registered domain only if `is_icann` is true.\n\nConcatenate any of the placeholder prefixes with any of the placeholder endings to use the placeholder.\n\nExamples:\n\n- `{qs.domain.public_suffix}` returns the public suffix of the value in the `domain` query string parameter.\n- `{header.Host.registered_domain}` returns the registered domain of the value in the `Host` header field.\n- `{header.Host.public_registered_domain}` is the same as the previous, but only returns a non-empty value if the domain suffix is a public/ICANN-managed ending.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.public_suffix", "title": "All Modules", "description": "This page lists all registered Caddy modules.

An integer is interpreted as nanoseconds. If a string, it is a Go time.Duration value such as `300ms`, `1.5h`, or `2h45m`; valid units are `ns`, `us`/ `µs`, `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h`, and `d`.\n\n[🔗](https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.handlers.acme_server#host) host\n\nThe hostname or IP address by which ACME clients will access the server. This is used to populate the ACME directory endpoint. If not set, the Host header of the request will be used.\nCOMPATIBILITY NOTE / TODO: This property may go away in the future.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful caddy expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Caddy JSON Subscriptions Documentation is in caddy?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Caddy JSON Subscriptions Documentation in caddy.\n\n# Caddy JSON Subscriptions Documentation\n\nSubscriptions bind handlers to one or more events either globally or scoped to specific modules or module namespaces.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Description\n\nSubscriptions bind handlers to one or more events either globally or scoped to specific modules or module namespaces.\n\n## Field List\n\nThe following fields are available for subscriptions:\n\n- **events**: The name(s) of the event(s) to bind to. Default: all events.\n- **modules**: The ID or namespace of the module(s) from which events originate to listen to for events. Default: all modules.\n\nEvents propagate up, so events emitted by module \"a.b.c\" will also trigger the event for \"a.b\" and \"a\". Thus, to receive all events from \"a.b.c\" and \"a.b.d\", for example, one can subscribe to either \"a.b\" or all of \"a\" entirely.\n\nModuleID is a string that uniquely identifies a Caddy module. A module ID is lightly structured. It consists of dot-separated labels which form a simple hierarchy from left to right. The last label is the module name, and the labels before that constitute the namespace (or scope).\n\nThus, a module ID has the form: <namespace>.<module_name>\n\nAn ID with no dot has the empty namespace, which is appropriate for app modules (these are \"top-level\" modules that Caddy core loads and runs).\n\nModule IDs should be lowercase and use underscores (_) instead of spaces.\n\nExamples of valid IDs:\n- http\n- http.handlers.file_server\n- caddy.logging.encoders.json\n\n## Handlers\n\nThe event handler modules.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful caddy expert.\n\nUser: How do I field list in caddy?\n\nAssistant: To field list in caddy, here's what you do:\nThe following fields are available for subscriptions:\n\n- **events**: The name(s) of the event(s) to bind to. Default: all events.\n- **modules**: The ID or namespace of the module(s) from which events originate to listen to for events. Default: all modules.\n\nEvents propagate up, so events emitted by module \"a.b.c\" will also trigger the event for \"a.b\" and \"a\". Thus, to receive all events from \"a.b.c\" and \"a.b.d\", for example, one can subscribe to either \"a.b\" or all of \"a\" entirely.\n\nModuleID is a string that uniquely identifies a Caddy module. A module ID is lightly structured. It consists of dot-separated labels which form a simple hierarchy from left to right. The last label is the module name, and the labels before that constitute the namespace (or scope).\n\nThus, a module ID has the form: <namespace>.<module_name>\n\nAn ID with no dot has the empty namespace, which is appropriate for app modules (these are \"top-level\" modules that Caddy core loads and runs).\n\nModule IDs should be lowercase and use underscores (_) instead of spaces.\n\nExamples of valid IDs:\n- http\n- http.handlers.file_server\n- caddy.logging.encoders.json.\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/events/subscriptions", "title": "Caddy JSON Subscriptions Documentation", "description": "Subscriptions bind handlers to one or more events either globally or scoped to specific modules or module namespaces.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 3, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 03:17:00", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"og:url": "https://caddyserver.com/", "title": "events/subscriptions - JSON Config Structure - Caddy Documentation", "og:image": "https://caddyserver.com/old/resources/images/caddy-open-graph.jpg", "twitter:card": "summary", "twitter:image": "https://caddyserver.com/old/resources/images/caddy-open-graph.jpg", "author": "Caddy Web Server", "favicon": "https://caddyserver.com/old/resources/images/favicon.png?v=f3b6d18", "description": "Caddy is a powerful, enterprise-ready, open source web server with automatic HTTPS written in Go", "og:type": "website", "ogDescription": "Caddy is a powerful, enterprise-ready, open source web server with automatic HTTPS written in Go", "ogUrl": "https://caddyserver.com/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "ogImage": "https://caddyserver.com/old/resources/images/caddy-open-graph.jpg", "theme-color": ["#5ea9a2", "#123245", "#123245"], "og:description": "Caddy is a powerful, enterprise-ready, open source web server with automatic HTTPS written in Go", "scrapeId": "0504fd8f-7df9-481f-9c3b-e52ce6278b13", "sourceURL": "https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/events/subscriptions", "url": "https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/apps/events/subscriptions", "statusCode": 200}}}
