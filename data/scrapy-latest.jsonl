{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Contributing to Scrapy is in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Contributing to Scrapy in scrapy-latest.\n\n# Contributing to Scrapy\n\nThis document outlines the various ways to contribute to the Scrapy project, including reporting bugs, submitting patches, and adhering to coding standards.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Important\n\nDouble check that you are reading the most recent version of this document at https://docs.scrapy.org/en/master/contributing.html\n\n## Ways to Contribute\n\nThere are many ways to contribute to Scrapy. Here are some of them:\n\n- Report bugs and request features in the issue tracker, trying to follow the guidelines detailed in Reporting bugs below.\n- Submit patches for new functionalities and/or bug fixes. Please read Writing patches and Submitting patches below for details on how to write and submit a patch.\n- Blog about Scrapy. Tell the world how you’re using Scrapy. This will help newcomers with more examples and will help the Scrapy project to increase its visibility.\n- Join the Scrapy subreddit and share your ideas on how to improve Scrapy. We’re always open to suggestions.\n- Answer Scrapy questions at Stack Overflow.\n\n## Reporting bugs\n\nPlease report security issues only to scrapy-security@googlegroups.com. This is a private list only open to trusted Scrapy developers, and its archives are not public.\n\nWell-written bug reports are very helpful, so keep in mind the following guidelines when you’re going to report a new bug:\n\n- check the FAQ first to see if your issue is addressed in a well-known question\n- if you have a general question about Scrapy usage, please ask it at Stack Overflow (use “scrapy” tag).\n- check the open issues to see if the issue has already been reported. If it has, don’t dismiss the report, but check the ticket history and comments. If you have additional useful information, please leave a comment, or consider sending a pull request with a fix.\n- search the scrapy-users list and Scrapy subreddit to see if it has been discussed there, or if you’re not sure if what you’re seeing is a bug. You can also ask in the #scrapy IRC channel.\n- write complete, reproducible, specific bug reports. The smaller the test case, the better. Remember that other developers won’t have your project to reproduce the bug, so please include all relevant files required to reproduce it. See for example StackOverflow’s guide on creating a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example exhibiting the issue.\n- the most awesome way to provide a complete reproducible example is to send a pull request which adds a failing test case to the Scrapy testing suite. This is helpful even if you don’t have an intention to fix the issue yourselves.\n- include the output of `scrapy version -v` so developers working on your bug know exactly which version and platform it occurred on, which is often very helpful for reproducing it, or knowing if it was already fixed.\n\n## Writing patches\n\nScrapy has a list of good first issues and help wanted issues that you can work on. These issues are a great way to get started with contributing to Scrapy. If you’re new to the codebase, you may want to focus on documentation or testing-related issues, as they are always useful and can help you get more familiar with the project. You can also check Scrapy’s test coverage to see which areas may benefit from more tests.\n\nThe better a patch is written, the higher the chances that it’ll get accepted and the sooner it will be merged.\n\nWell-written patches should:\n\n- contain the minimum amount of code required for the specific change. Small patches are easier to review and merge. So, if you’re doing more than one change (or bug fix), please consider submitting one patch per change. Do not collapse multiple changes into a single patch. For big changes consider using a patch queue.\n- pass all unit-tests. See Running tests below.\n- include one (or more) test cases that check the bug fixed or the new functionality added. See Writing tests below.\n- if you’re adding or changing a public (documented) API, please include the documentation changes in the same patch. See Documentation policies below.\n- if you’re adding a private API, please add a regular expression to the coverage_ignore_pyobjects variable of docs/conf.py to exclude the new private API from documentation coverage checks.\n\nTo see if your private API is skipped properly, generate a documentation coverage report as follows:\n\n```\ntox -e docs-coverage\n```\n\n## Submitting patches\n\nThe best way to submit a patch is to issue a pull request on GitHub, optionally creating a new issue first.\n\nRemember to explain what was fixed or the new functionality (what it is, why it’s needed, etc). The more info you include, the easier will be for core developers to understand and accept your patch.\n\nYou can also discuss the new functionality (or bug fix) before creating the patch, but it’s always good to have a patch ready to illustrate your arguments and show that you have put some additional thought into the subject. A good starting point is to send a pull request on GitHub. It can be simple enough to illustrate your idea, and leave documentation/tests for later, after the idea has been validated and proven useful. Alternatively, you can start a conversation in the Scrapy subreddit to discuss your idea first.\n\nSometimes there is an existing pull request for the problem you’d like to solve, which is stalled for some reason. Often the pull request is in a right direction, but changes are requested by Scrapy maintainers, and the original pull request author hasn’t had time to address them. In this case consider picking up this pull request: open a new pull request with all commits from the original pull request, as well as additional changes to address the raised issues. Doing so helps a lot; it is not considered rude as long as the original author is acknowledged by keeping his/her commits.\n\nYou can pull an existing pull request to a local branch by running `git fetch upstream pull/$PR_NUMBER/head:$BRANCH_NAME_TO_CREATE` (replace ‘upstream’ with a remote name for scrapy repository, $PR_NUMBER with an ID of the pull request, and $BRANCH_NAME_TO_CREATE with a name of the branch you want to create locally). See also: https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/checking-out-pull-requests-locally#modifying-an-inactive-pull-request-locally.\n\nWhen writing GitHub pull requests, try to keep titles short but descriptive. E.g. For bug #411: “Scrapy hangs if an exception raises in start_requests” prefer “Fix hanging when exception occurs in start_requests (#411)” instead of “Fix for #411”. Complete titles make it easy to skim through the issue tracker.\n\nFinally, try to keep aesthetic changes (PEP 8 compliance, unused imports removal, etc) in separate commits from functional changes. This will make pull requests easier to review and more likely to get merged.\n\n## Coding style\n\nPlease follow these coding conventions when writing code for inclusion in Scrapy:\n\n- We use black for code formatting. There is a hook in the pre-commit config that will automatically format your code before every commit. You can also run black manually with `tox -e pre-commit`.\n- Don’t put your name in the code you contribute; git provides enough metadata to identify author of the code.\n\n## Pre-commit\n\nWe use pre-commit to automatically address simple code issues before every commit.\n\nAfter your create a local clone of your fork of the Scrapy repository:\n\n1. Install pre-commit.\n2. On the root of your local clone of the Scrapy repository, run the following command:\n\n```\npre-commit install\n```\n\nNow pre-commit will check your changes every time you create a Git commit. Upon finding issues, pre-commit aborts your commit, and either fixes those issues automatically, or only reports them to you. If it fixes those issues automatically, creating your commit again should succeed. Otherwise, you may need to address the corresponding issues manually first.\n\n## Documentation policies\n\nFor reference documentation of API members (classes, methods, etc.) use docstrings and make sure that the Sphinx documentation uses the autodoc extension to pull the docstrings. API reference documentation should follow docstring conventions (PEP 257) and be IDE-friendly: short, to the point, and it may provide short examples.\n\nOther types of documentation, such as tutorials or topics, should be covered in files within the docs/ directory. This includes documentation that is specific to an API member, but goes beyond API reference documentation.\n\nIn any case, if something is covered in a docstring, use the autodoc extension to pull the docstring into the documentation instead of duplicating the docstring in files within the docs/ directory.\n\nDocumentation updates that cover new or modified features must use Sphinx’s versionadded and versionchanged directives. Use VERSION as version, we will replace it with the actual version right before the corresponding release. When we release a new major or minor version of Scrapy, we remove these directives if they are older than 3 years.\n\nDocumentation about deprecated features must be removed as those features are deprecated, so that new readers do not run into it.

Running tests requires tox.\n\n## Running tests\n\nTo run all tests:\n\n```\ntox\n```\n\nTo run a specific test (say tests/test_loader.py) use:\n\n> `tox -- tests/test_loader.py`\n\nTo run the tests on a specific tox environment, use -e <name> with an environment name from tox.ini. For example, to run the tests with Python 3.10 use:\n\n```\ntox -e py310\n```\n\nYou can also specify a comma-separated list of environments, and use tox’s parallel mode to run the tests on multiple environments in parallel:\n\n```\ntox -e py39,py310 -p auto\n```\n\nTo pass command-line options to pytest, add them after -- in your call to tox. Using -- overrides the default positional arguments defined in tox.ini, so you must include those default positional arguments (scrapy tests) after -- as well:\n\n```\ntox -- scrapy tests -x  # stop after first failure\n```\n\nYou can also use the pytest-xdist plugin. For example, to run all tests on the Python 3.10 tox environment using all your CPU cores:\n\n```\ntox -e py310 -- scrapy tests -n auto\n```\n\nTo see coverage report install coverage (pip install coverage) and run:\n\n> `coverage report`\n\nsee output of `coverage --help` for more options like html or xml report.\n\n## Writing tests\n\nAll functionality (including new features and bug fixes) must include a test case to check that it works as expected, so please include tests for your patches if you want them to get accepted sooner.\n\nScrapy uses unit-tests, which are located in the tests/ directory. Their module name typically resembles the full path of the module they’re testing. For example, the item loaders code is in:\n\n```\nscrapy.loader\n```\n\nAnd their unit-tests are in:\n\n```\ntests/test_loader.py\n```\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/contributing.html", "title": "Contributing to Scrapy", "description": "This document outlines the various ways to contribute to the Scrapy project, including reporting bugs, submitting patches, and adhering to coding standards.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 11, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 02:57:30", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"readthedocs-http-status": "200", "generator": "Docutils 0.19: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/", "title": "Contributing to Scrapy — Scrapy 2.12.0 documentation", "readthedocs-resolver-filename": "/contributing.html", "readthedocs-project-slug": "scrapy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "readthedocs-version-slug": "latest", "language": "en", "scrapeId": "96576e53-e367-49b7-b169-e7a8ac0e2820", "sourceURL": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/contributing.html", "url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/contributing.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: How do I reporting bugs in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: To reporting bugs in scrapy-latest, here's what you do:\nPlease report security issues only to scrapy-security@googlegroups.com. This is a private list only open to trusted Scrapy developers, and its archives are not public.\n\nWell-written bug reports are very helpful, so keep in mind the following guidelines when you’re going to report a new bug:\n\n- check the FAQ first to see if your issue is addressed in a well-known question\n- if you have a general question about Scrapy usage, please ask it at Stack Overflow (use “scrapy” tag).\n- check the open issues to see if the issue has already been reported. If it has, don’t dismiss the report, but check the ticket history and comments. If you have additional useful information, please leave a comment, or consider sending a pull request with a fix.\n- search the scrapy-users list and Scrapy subreddit to see if it has been discussed there, or if you’re not sure if what you’re seeing is a bug. You can also ask in the #scrapy IRC channel.\n- write complete, reproducible, specific bug reports. The smaller the test case, the better. Remember that other developers won’t have your project to reproduce the bug, so please include all relevant files required to reproduce it. See for example StackOverflow’s guide on creating a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example exhibiting the issue.\n- the most awesome way to provide a complete reproducible example is to send a pull request which adds a failing test case to the Scrapy testing suite. This is helpful even if you don’t have an intention to fix the issue yourselves.\n- include the output of `scrapy version -v` so developers working on your bug know exactly which version and platform it occurred on, which is often very helpful for reproducing it, or knowing if it was already fixed..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/contributing.html", "title": "Contributing to Scrapy", "description": "This document outlines the various ways to contribute to the Scrapy project, including reporting bugs, submitting patches, and adhering to coding standards.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 11, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 02:57:30", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"readthedocs-http-status": "200", "generator": "Docutils 0.19: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/", "title": "Contributing to Scrapy — Scrapy 2.12.0 documentation", "readthedocs-resolver-filename": "/contributing.html", "readthedocs-project-slug": "scrapy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "readthedocs-version-slug": "latest", "language": "en", "scrapeId": "96576e53-e367-49b7-b169-e7a8ac0e2820", "sourceURL": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/contributing.html", "url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/contributing.html", "statusCode": 200}}}
{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: How do I writing patches in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: To writing patches in scrapy-latest, here's what you do:\nScrapy has a list of good first issues and help wanted issues that you can work on. These issues are a great way to get started with contributing to Scrapy. If you’re new to the codebase, you may want to focus on documentation or testing-related issues, as they are always useful and can help you get more familiar with the project. You can also check Scrapy’s test coverage to see which areas may benefit from more tests.\n\nThe better a patch is written, the higher the chances that it’ll get accepted and the sooner it will be merged.\n\nWell-written patches should:\n\n- contain the minimum amount of code required for the specific change. Small patches are easier to review and merge. So, if you’re doing more than one change (or bug fix), please consider submitting one patch per change. Do not collapse multiple changes into a single patch. For big changes consider using a patch queue.\n- pass all unit-tests. See Running tests below.\n- include one (or more) test cases that check the bug fixed or the new functionality added. See Writing tests below.\n- if you’re adding or changing a public (documented) API, please include the documentation changes in the same patch. See Documentation policies below.\n- if you’re adding a private API, please add a regular expression to the coverage_ignore_pyobjects variable of docs/conf.py to exclude the new private API from documentation coverage checks.\n\nTo see if your private API is skipped properly, generate a documentation coverage report as follows:\n\n```\ntox -e docs-coverage\n```.\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/contributing.html", "title": "Contributing to Scrapy", "description": "This document outlines the various ways to contribute to the Scrapy project, including reporting bugs, submitting patches, and adhering to coding standards.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 11, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 02:57:30", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"readthedocs-http-status": "200", "generator": "Docutils 0.19: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/", "title": "Contributing to Scrapy — Scrapy 2.12.0 documentation", "readthedocs-resolver-filename": "/contributing.html", "readthedocs-project-slug": "scrapy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "readthedocs-version-slug": "latest", "language": "en", "scrapeId": "96576e53-e367-49b7-b169-e7a8ac0e2820", "sourceURL": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/contributing.html", "url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/contributing.html", "statusCode": 200}}}
{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: How do I submitting patches in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: To submitting patches in scrapy-latest, here's what you do:\nThe best way to submit a patch is to issue a pull request on GitHub, optionally creating a new issue first.\n\nRemember to explain what was fixed or the new functionality (what it is, why it’s needed, etc). The more info you include, the easier will be for core developers to understand and accept your patch.\n\nYou can also discuss the new functionality (or bug fix) before creating the patch, but it’s always good to have a patch ready to illustrate your arguments and show that you have put some additional thought into the subject. A good starting point is to send a pull request on GitHub. It can be simple enough to illustrate your idea, and leave documentation/tests for later, after the idea has been validated and proven useful. Alternatively, you can start a conversation in the Scrapy subreddit to discuss your idea first.\n\nSometimes there is an existing pull request for the problem you’d like to solve, which is stalled for some reason. Often the pull request is in a right direction, but changes are requested by Scrapy maintainers, and the original pull request author hasn’t had time to address them. In this case consider picking up this pull request: open a new pull request with all commits from the original pull request, as well as additional changes to address the raised issues. Doing so helps a lot; it is not considered rude as long as the original author is acknowledged by keeping his/her commits.\n\nYou can pull an existing pull request to a local branch by running `git fetch upstream pull/$PR_NUMBER/head:$BRANCH_NAME_TO_CREATE` (replace ‘upstream’ with a remote name for scrapy repository, $PR_NUMBER with an ID of the pull request, and $BRANCH_NAME_TO_CREATE with a name of the branch you want to create locally). See also: https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/checking-out-pull-requests-locally#modifying-an-inactive-pull-request-locally.\n\nWhen writing GitHub pull requests, try to keep titles short but descriptive. E.g. For bug #411: “Scrapy hangs if an exception raises in start_requests” prefer “Fix hanging when exception occurs in start_requests (#411)” instead of “Fix for #411”. Complete titles make it easy to skim through the issue tracker.\n\nFinally, try to keep aesthetic changes (PEP 8 compliance, unused imports removal, etc) in separate commits from functional changes. This will make pull requests easier to review and more likely to get merged..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/contributing.html", "title": "Contributing to Scrapy", "description": "This document outlines the various ways to contribute to the Scrapy project, including reporting bugs, submitting patches, and adhering to coding standards.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 11, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 02:57:30", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"readthedocs-http-status": "200", "generator": "Docutils 0.19: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/", "title": "Contributing to Scrapy — Scrapy 2.12.0 documentation", "readthedocs-resolver-filename": "/contributing.html", "readthedocs-project-slug": "scrapy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "readthedocs-version-slug": "latest", "language": "en", "scrapeId": "96576e53-e367-49b7-b169-e7a8ac0e2820", "sourceURL": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/contributing.html", "url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/contributing.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

API reference documentation should follow docstring conventions (PEP 257) and be IDE-friendly: short, to the point, and it may provide short examples.\n\nOther types of documentation, such as tutorials or topics, should be covered in files within the docs/ directory. This includes documentation that is specific to an API member, but goes beyond API reference documentation.\n\nIn any case, if something is covered in a docstring, use the autodoc extension to pull the docstring into the documentation instead of duplicating the docstring in files within the docs/ directory.\n\nDocumentation updates that cover new or modified features must use Sphinx’s versionadded and versionchanged directives. Use VERSION as version, we will replace it with the actual version right before the corresponding release. When we release a new major or minor version of Scrapy, we remove these directives if they are older than 3 years.\n\nDocumentation about deprecated features must be removed as those features are deprecated, so that new readers do not run into it.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Components is in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Components in scrapy-latest.\n\n# Components\n\nA Scrapy component is any class whose objects are built using build_from_crawler().Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Components\n\nA Scrapy component is any class whose objects are built using `build_from_crawler()`. That includes the classes that you may assign to the following settings:\n\n- `DNS_RESOLVER`\n- `DOWNLOAD_HANDLERS`\n- `DOWNLOADER_CLIENTCONTEXTFACTORY`\n- `DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES`\n- `DUPEFILTER_CLASS`\n- `EXTENSIONS`\n- `FEED_EXPORTERS`\n- `FEED_STORAGES`\n- `ITEM_PIPELINES`\n- `SCHEDULER`\n- `SCHEDULER_DISK_QUEUE`\n- `SCHEDULER_MEMORY_QUEUE`\n- `SCHEDULER_PRIORITY_QUEUE`\n- `SPIDER_MIDDLEWARES`\n\nThird-party Scrapy components may also let you define additional Scrapy components, usually configurable through settings, to modify their behavior.\n\n## Enforcing component requirements\n\nSometimes, your components may only be intended to work under certain conditions.

The [Engine](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/architecture.html#component-engine) gets the initial Requests to crawl from the [Spider](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/architecture.html#component-spiders).\n\n2. The [Engine](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/architecture.html#component-engine) schedules the Requests in the [Scheduler](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/architecture.html#component-scheduler) and asks for the next Requests to crawl.\n\n3. The [Scheduler](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/architecture.html#component-scheduler) returns the next Requests to the [Engine](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/architecture.html#component-engine).\n\n4. The [Engine](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/architecture.html#component-engine) sends the Requests to the [Downloader](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/architecture.html#component-downloader), passing through the [Downloader Middlewares](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/architecture.html#component-downloader-middleware) (see [`process_request()`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.DownloaderMiddleware.process_request \"scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.DownloaderMiddleware.process_request\")).\n\n5. Once the page finishes downloading the [Downloader](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/architecture.html#component-downloader) generates a Response (with that page) and sends it to the Engine, passing through the [Downloader Middlewares](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/architecture.html#component-downloader-middleware) (see [`process_response()`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.DownloaderMiddleware.process_response \"scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.DownloaderMiddleware.process_response\")).\n\n6. The [Engine](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/architecture.html#component-engine) receives the Response from the [Downloader](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/architecture.html#component-downloader) and sends it to the [Spider](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/architecture.html#component-spiders) for processing, passing through the [Spider Middleware](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/architecture.html#component-spider-middleware) (see [`process_spider_input()`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spider-middleware.html#scrapy.spidermiddlewares.SpiderMiddleware.process_spider_input \"scrapy.spidermiddlewares.SpiderMiddleware.process_spider_input\")).\n\n7. The [Spider](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/architecture.html#component-spiders) processes the Response and returns scraped items and new Requests (to follow) to the [Engine](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/architecture.html#component-engine), passing through the [Spider Middleware](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/architecture.html#component-spider-middleware) (see [`process_spider_output()`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spider-middleware.html#scrapy.spidermiddlewares.SpiderMiddleware.process_spider_output \"scrapy.spidermiddlewares.SpiderMiddleware.process_spider_output\")).\n\n8. The [Engine](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/architecture.html#component-engine) sends processed items to [Item Pipelines](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/architecture.html#component-pipelines), then send processed Requests to the [Scheduler](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/architecture.html#component-scheduler) and asks for possible next Requests to crawl.\n\n9. The process repeats (from step 3) until there are no more requests from the [Scheduler](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/architecture.html#component-scheduler).\n\n## Components\n\n### Scrapy Engine\nThe engine is responsible for controlling the data flow between all components of the system, and triggering events when certain actions occur. See the [Data Flow](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/architecture.html#data-flow) section above for more details.\n\n### Scheduler\nThe [scheduler](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/scheduler.html#topics-scheduler) receives requests from the engine and enqueues them for feeding them later (also to the engine) when the engine requests them.\n\n### Downloader\nThe Downloader is responsible for fetching web pages and feeding them to the engine which, in turn, feeds them to the spiders.\n\n### Spiders\nSpiders are custom classes written by Scrapy users to parse responses and extract [items](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/items.html#topics-items) from them or additional requests to follow. For more information see [Spiders](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spiders.html#topics-spiders).\n\n### Item Pipeline\nThe Item Pipeline is responsible for processing the items once they have been extracted (or scraped) by the spiders. Typical tasks include cleansing, validation and persistence (like storing the item in a database). For more information see [Item Pipeline](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/item-pipeline.html#topics-item-pipeline).\n\n### Downloader middlewares\nDownloader middlewares are specific hooks that sit between the Engine and the Downloader and process requests when they pass from the Engine to the Downloader, and responses that pass from Downloader to the Engine.\n\nUse a Downloader middleware if you need to do one of the following:\n- process a request just before it is sent to the Downloader (i.e. right before Scrapy sends the request to the website);\n- change received response before passing it to a spider;\n- send a new Request instead of passing received response to a spider;\n- pass response to a spider without fetching a web page;\n- silently drop some requests.\n\nFor more information see [Downloader Middleware](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#topics-downloader-middleware).\n\n### Spider middlewares\nSpider middlewares are specific hooks that sit between the Engine and the Spiders and are able to process spider input (responses) and output (items and requests).\n\nUse a Spider middleware if you need to\n- post-process output of spider callbacks - change/add/remove requests or items;\n- post-process start_requests;\n- handle spider exceptions;\n- call errback instead of callback for some of the requests based on response content.\n\nFor more information see [Spider Middleware](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spider-middleware.html#topics-spider-middleware).\n\n## Event-driven networking\n\nScrapy is written with [Twisted](https://twisted.org/), a popular event-driven networking framework for Python. Thus, it’s implemented using a non-blocking (aka asynchronous) code for concurrency.\n\nFor more information about asynchronous programming and Twisted see these links:\n- [Introduction to Deferreds](https://docs.twisted.org/en/stable/core/howto/defer-intro.html \"(in Twisted v24.10)\")\n- [Twisted Introduction - Krondo](https://krondo.com/an-introduction-to-asynchronous-programming-and-twisted/)\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/architecture.html", "title": "Architecture overview", "description": "This document describes the architecture of Scrapy and how its components interact.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 4, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 03:03:11", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "generator": "Docutils 0.19: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/", "title": "Architecture overview — Scrapy 2.12.0 documentation", "language": "en", "readthedocs-project-slug": "scrapy", "readthedocs-http-status": "200", "readthedocs-version-slug": "latest", "readthedocs-resolver-filename": "/topics/architecture.html", "scrapeId": "26b00b6b-f589-4c40-a840-83a9a51a90d2", "sourceURL": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/architecture.html", "url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/architecture.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Signals is in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Signals in scrapy-latest.\n\n# Signals\n\nScrapy uses signals extensively to notify when certain events occur. You can catch some of those signals in your Scrapy project (using an extension, for example) to perform additional tasks or extend Scrapy to add functionality not provided out of the box.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Deferred signal handlers\n\nSome signals support returning `Deferred` or awaitable objects from their handlers, allowing you to run asynchronous code that does not block Scrapy. If a signal handler returns one of these objects, Scrapy waits for that asynchronous operation to finish.\n\nLet’s take an example using coroutines:\n\n```python\nimport scrapy\n\nclass SignalSpider(scrapy.Spider):\n    name = \"signals\"\n    start_urls = [\"https://quotes.toscrape.com/page/1/\"]\n\n    @classmethod\n    def from_crawler(cls, crawler, *args, **kwargs):\n        spider = super(SignalSpider, cls).from_crawler(crawler, *args, **kwargs)\n        crawler.signals.connect(spider.item_scraped, signal=signals.item_scraped)\n        return spider\n\n    async def item_scraped(self, item):\n        # Send the scraped item to the server\n        response = await treq.post(\n            \"http://example.com/post\",\n            json.dumps(item).encode(\"ascii\"),\n            headers={b\"Content-Type\": [b\"application/json\"]},\n        )\n\n        return response\n\n    def parse(self, response):\n        for quote in response.css(\"div.quote\"):\n            yield {\n                \"text\": quote.css(\"span.text::text\").get(),\n                \"author\": quote.css(\"small.author::text\").get(),\n                \"tags\": quote.css(\"div.tags a.tag::text\").getall(),\n            }\n```\n\nSee the Built-in signals reference below to know which signals support `Deferred` and awaitable objects.\n\n## Built-in signals reference\n\nHere’s the list of Scrapy built-in signals and their meaning.\n\n### Engine signals\n#### engine_started\n`scrapy.signals.engine_started()`\nSent when the Scrapy engine has started crawling.\n\nThis signal supports returning deferreds from its handlers.\n\nNote\nThis signal may be fired after the `spider_opened` signal, depending on how the spider was started. So don’t rely on this signal getting fired before `spider_opened`.\n\n#### engine_stopped\n`scrapy.signals.engine_stopped()`\nSent when the Scrapy engine is stopped (for example, when a crawling process has finished).\n\nThis signal supports returning deferreds from its handlers.\n\n### Item signals\n#### item_scraped\n`scrapy.signals.item_scraped( _item_, _response_, _spider_)`\nSent when an item has been scraped, after it has passed all the Item Pipeline stages (without being dropped).\n\nThis signal supports returning deferreds from its handlers.\n\nParameters:\n- **item** ( item object) – the scraped item\n- **spider** ( Spider object) – the spider which scraped the item\n- **response** ( Response | None) – the response from where the item was scraped, or None if it was yielded from `start_requests()`.\n\n#### item_dropped\n`scrapy.signals.item_dropped( _item_, _response_, _exception_, _spider_)`\nSent after an item has been dropped from the Item Pipeline when some stage raised a `DropItem` exception.\n\nThis signal supports returning deferreds from its handlers.\n\nParameters:\n- **item** ( item object) – the item dropped from the Item Pipeline\n- **spider** ( Spider object) – the spider which scraped the item\n- **response** ( Response | None) – the response from where the item was dropped, or None if it was yielded from `start_requests()`.\n- **exception** ( DropItem exception) – the exception (which must be a DropItem subclass) which caused the item to be dropped.\n\n## Spider signals\n\n#### spider_closed\n`scrapy.signals.spider_closed( _spider_, _reason_)`\nSent after a spider has been closed. This can be used to release per-spider resources reserved on `spider_opened`.\n\nThis signal supports returning deferreds from its handlers.\n\nParameters:\n- **spider** ( Spider object) – the spider which has been closed\n- **reason** ( str) – a string which describes the reason why the spider was closed. If it was closed because the spider has completed scraping, the reason is 'finished'. Otherwise, if the spider was manually closed by calling the `close_spider` engine method, then the reason is the one passed in the `reason` argument of that method (which defaults to 'cancelled').

{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Selectors is in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Selectors in scrapy-latest.\n\n# Selectors\n\nWhen you’re scraping web pages, the most common task you need to perform is to extract data from the HTML source. There are several libraries available to achieve this, such as BeautifulSoup, lxml, and Scrapy selectors.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Using selectors\n\nResponse objects expose a Selector instance on .selector attribute:\n\n```\n>>> response.selector.xpath(\"//span/text()\").get()\n'good'\n```\n\nQuerying responses using XPath and CSS is so common that responses include two more shortcuts: response.xpath() and response.css():\n\n```\n>>> response.xpath(\"//span/text()\").get()\n'good'\n>>> response.css(\"span::text\").get()\n'good'\n```\n\nScrapy selectors are instances of Selector class constructed by passing either TextResponse object or markup as a string (in text argument). Usually there is no need to construct Scrapy selectors manually: response object is available in Spider callbacks, so in most cases it is more convenient to use response.css() and response.xpath() shortcuts. By using response.selector or one of these shortcuts you can also ensure the response body is parsed only once. But if required, it is possible to use Selector directly. Constructing from text:\n\n```\n>>> from scrapy.selector import Selector\n>>> body = \"<html><body><span>good</span></body></html>\"\n>>> Selector(text=body).xpath(\"//span/text()\").get()\n'good'\n```\n\nConstructing from response - HtmlResponse is one of TextResponse subclasses:\n\n```\n>>> from scrapy.selector import Selector\n>>> from scrapy.http import HtmlResponse\n>>> response = HtmlResponse(url=\"http://example.com\", body=body, encoding=\"utf-8\")\n>>> Selector(response=response).xpath(\"//span/text()\").get()\n'good'\n```\n\nSelector automatically chooses the best parsing rules (XML vs HTML) based on input type.\n\n## Extensions to CSS Selectors\n\nPer W3C standards, CSS selectors do not support selecting text nodes or attribute values. But selecting these is so essential in a web scraping context that Scrapy (parsel) implements a couple of non-standard pseudo-elements:\n\n- to select text nodes, use ::text\n- to select attribute values, use ::attr(name) where name is the name of the attribute that you want the value of\n\nExamples:\n\n- `title::text` selects children text nodes of a descendant <title> element:\n\n```\n>>> response.css(\"title::text\").get()\n'Example website'\n```\n\n- `*::text` selects all descendant text nodes of the current selector context:\n\n```\n>>> response.css(\"#images *::text\").getall()\n['\\n   ', 'Name: My image 1 ', '\\n   ', 'Name: My image 2 ', '\\n   ', 'Name: My image 3 ', '\\n   ', 'Name: My image 4 ', '\\n   ', 'Name: My image 5 ', '\\n  ']\n```\n\n- `foo::text` returns no results if foo element exists, but contains no text (i.e. text is empty):\n\n```\n>>> response.css(\"img::text\").getall()\n[]\n```\n\nThis means .css('foo::text').get() could return None even if an element exists. Use default='' if you always want a string:\n\n```\n>>> response.css(\"img::text\").get()\n>>> response.css(\"img::text\").get(default=\"\")\n''\n```\n\n- `a::attr(href)` selects the href attribute value of descendant links:\n\n```\n>>> response.css(\"a::attr(href)\").getall()\n['image1.html', 'image2.html', 'image3.html', 'image4.html', 'image5.html']\n```\n\nNote: See also: Selecting element attributes.\n\n## Nesting selectors\n\nThe selection methods (.xpath() or .css()) return a list of selectors of the same type, so you can call the selection methods for those selectors too. Here’s an example:\n\n```\n>>> links = response.xpath('//a[contains(@href, \"image\")]')\n>>> links.getall()\n['<a href=\"image1.html\">Name: My image 1 <br><img src=\"image1_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"image1\"></a>', '<a href=\"image2.html\">Name: My image 2 <br><img src=\"image2_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"image2\"></a>', '<a href=\"image3.html\">Name: My image 3 <br><img src=\"image3_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"image3\"></a>', '<a href=\"image4.html\">Name: My image 4 <br><img src=\"image4_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"image4\"></a>', '<a href=\"image5.html\">Name: My image 5 <br><img src=\"image5_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"image5\"></a>']\n>>> for index, link in enumerate(links):\n...     href_xpath = link.xpath(\"@href\").get()\n...     img_xpath = link.xpath(\"img/@src\").get()\n...     print(f\"Link number {index} points to url {href_xpath!r} and image {img_xpath!r}\")\n...\nLink number 0 points to url 'image1.html' and image 'image1_thumb.jpg'\nLink number 1 points to url 'image2.html' and image 'image2_thumb.jpg'\nLink number 2 points to url 'image3.html' and image 'image3_thumb.jpg'\nLink number 3 points to url 'image4.html' and image 'image4_thumb.jpg'\nLink number 4 points to url 'image5.html' and image 'image5_thumb.jpg'\n```\n\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/selectors.html", "title": "Selectors", "description": "When you’re scraping web pages, the most common task you need to perform is to extract data from the HTML source.

But selecting these is so essential in a web scraping context that Scrapy (parsel) implements a couple of non-standard pseudo-elements:\n\n- to select text nodes, use ::text\n- to select attribute values, use ::attr(name) where name is the name of the attribute that you want the value of\n\nExamples:\n\n- `title::text` selects children text nodes of a descendant <title> element:\n\n```\n>>> response.css(\"title::text\").get()\n'Example website'\n```\n\n- `*::text` selects all descendant text nodes of the current selector context:\n\n```\n>>> response.css(\"#images *::text\").getall()\n['\\n   ', 'Name: My image 1 ', '\\n   ', 'Name: My image 2 ', '\\n   ', 'Name: My image 3 ', '\\n   ', 'Name: My image 4 ', '\\n   ', 'Name: My image 5 ', '\\n  ']\n```\n\n- `foo::text` returns no results if foo element exists, but contains no text (i.e. text is empty):\n\n```\n>>> response.css(\"img::text\").getall()\n[]\n```\n\nThis means .css('foo::text').get() could return None even if an element exists. Use default='' if you always want a string:\n\n```\n>>> response.css(\"img::text\").get()\n>>> response.css(\"img::text\").get(default=\"\")\n''\n```\n\n- `a::attr(href)` selects the href attribute value of descendant links:\n\n```\n>>> response.css(\"a::attr(href)\").getall()\n['image1.html', 'image2.html', 'image3.html', 'image4.html', 'image5.html']\n```\n\nNote: See also: Selecting element attributes..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/selectors.html", "title": "Selectors", "description": "When you’re scraping web pages, the most common task you need to perform is to extract data from the HTML source.

Scrapy offers an integrated way of testing your spiders by the means of contracts.\n\nThis allows you to test each callback of your spider by hardcoding a sample url and check various constraints for how the callback processes the response.

Iterators are\nconverted to lists before being passed to this hook.\n\nRaise [`ContractFail`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/contracts.html#scrapy.exceptions.ContractFail \"scrapy.exceptions.ContractFail\") from\n[`pre_process`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/contracts.html#scrapy.contracts.Contract.pre_process \"scrapy.contracts.Contract.pre_process\") or\n[`post_process`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/contracts.html#scrapy.contracts.Contract.post_process \"scrapy.contracts.Contract.post_process\") if expectations are not met:\n\n_class_ scrapy.exceptions.ContractFail [\\[source\\]](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/_modules/scrapy/exceptions.html#ContractFail) [¶](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/contracts.html#scrapy.exceptions.ContractFail \"Permalink to this definition\")\n\nError raised in case of a failing contract\n\nHere is a demo contract which checks the presence of a custom header in the response received:\n\n```\nfrom scrapy.contracts import Contract\nfrom scrapy.exceptions import ContractFail\n\nclass HasHeaderContract(Contract):\n    \"\"\"\n    Demo contract which checks the presence of a custom header\n    @has_header X-CustomHeader\n    \"\"\"\n\n    name = \"has_header\"\n\n    def pre_process(self, response):\n        for header in self.args:\n            if header not in response.headers:\n                raise ContractFail(\"X-CustomHeader not present\")\n\n```.\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/contracts.html", "title": "Spiders Contracts", "description": "Testing spiders can get particularly annoying and while nothing prevents you from writing unit tests the task gets cumbersome quickly.

It uses a simple spider that does nothing and just follows links.\n\n## Running the Benchmark\n\nTo run it use:\n\n```\nscrapy bench\n```\n\nYou should see an output like this:\n\n```\n2016-12-16 21:18:48 [scrapy.utils.log] INFO: Scrapy 1.2.2 started (bot: quotesbot)\n2016-12-16 21:18:48 [scrapy.utils.log] INFO: Overridden settings: {'CLOSESPIDER_TIMEOUT': 10, 'ROBOTSTXT_OBEY': True, 'SPIDER_MODULES': ['quotesbot.spiders'], 'LOGSTATS_INTERVAL': 1, 'BOT_NAME': 'quotesbot', 'LOG_LEVEL': 'INFO', 'NEWSPIDER_MODULE': 'quotesbot.spiders'}\n2016-12-16 21:18:49 [scrapy.middleware] INFO: Enabled extensions:\n['scrapy.extensions.closespider.CloseSpider',\n 'scrapy.extensions.logstats.LogStats',\n 'scrapy.extensions.telnet.TelnetConsole',\n 'scrapy.extensions.corestats.CoreStats']\n2016-12-16 21:18:49 [scrapy.middleware] INFO: Enabled downloader middlewares:\n['scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.offsite.OffsiteMiddleware',\n 'scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.robotstxt.RobotsTxtMiddleware',\n 'scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpauth.HttpAuthMiddleware',\n 'scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.downloadtimeout.DownloadTimeoutMiddleware',\n 'scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.defaultheaders.DefaultHeadersMiddleware',\n 'scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.useragent.UserAgentMiddleware',\n 'scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.retry.RetryMiddleware',\n 'scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.redirect.MetaRefreshMiddleware',\n 'scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpcompression.HttpCompressionMiddleware',\n 'scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.redirect.RedirectMiddleware',\n 'scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.cookies.CookiesMiddleware',\n 'scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.stats.DownloaderStats']\n2016-12-16 21:18:49 [scrapy.middleware] INFO: Enabled spider middlewares:\n['scrapy.spidermiddlewares.httperror.HttpErrorMiddleware',\n 'scrapy.spidermiddlewares.referer.RefererMiddleware',\n 'scrapy.spidermiddlewares.urllength.UrlLengthMiddleware',\n 'scrapy.spidermiddlewares.depth.DepthMiddleware']\n2016-12-16 21:18:49 [scrapy.middleware] INFO: Enabled item pipelines:\n[]\n2016-12-16 21:18:49 [scrapy.core.engine] INFO: Spider opened\n2016-12-16 21:18:49 [scrapy.extensions.logstats] INFO: Crawled 0 pages (at 0 pages/min), scraped 0 items (at 0 items/min)\n2016-12-16 21:18:50 [scrapy.extensions.logstats] INFO: Crawled 70 pages (at 4200 pages/min), scraped 0 items (at 0 items/min)\n2016-12-16 21:18:51 [scrapy.extensions.logstats] INFO: Crawled 134 pages (at 3840 pages/min), scraped 0 items (at 0 items/min)\n2016-12-16 21:18:52 [scrapy.extensions.logstats] INFO: Crawled 198 pages (at 3840 pages/min), scraped 0 items (at 0 items/min)\n2016-12-16 21:18:53 [scrapy.extensions.logstats] INFO: Crawled 254 pages (at 3360 pages/min), scraped 0 items (at 0 items/min)\n2016-12-16 21:18:54 [scrapy.extensions.logstats] INFO: Crawled 302 pages (at 2880 pages/min), scraped 0 items (at 0 items/min)\n2016-12-16 21:18:55 [scrapy.extensions.logstats] INFO: Crawled 358 pages (at 3360 pages/min), scraped 0 items (at 0 items/min)\n2016-12-16 21:18:56 [scrapy.extensions.logstats] INFO: Crawled 406 pages (at 2880 pages/min), scraped 0 items (at 0 items/min)\n2016-12-16 21:18:57 [scrapy.extensions.logstats] INFO: Crawled 438 pages (at 1920 pages/min), scraped 0 items (at 0 items/min)\n2016-12-16 21:18:58 [scrapy.extensions.logstats] INFO: Crawled 470 pages (at 1920 pages/min), scraped 0 items (at 0 items/min)\n2016-12-16 21:18:59 [scrapy.core.engine] INFO: Closing spider (closespider_timeout)\n2016-12-16 21:18:59 [scrapy.extensions.logstats] INFO: Crawled 518 pages (at 2880 pages/min), scraped 0 items (at 0 items/min)\n2016-12-16 21:19:00 [scrapy.statscollectors] INFO: Dumping Scrapy stats:\n{'downloader/request_bytes': 229995,\n 'downloader/request_count': 534,\n 'downloader/request_method_count/GET': 534,\n 'downloader/response_bytes': 1565504,\n 'downloader/response_count': 534,\n 'downloader/response_status_count/200': 534,\n 'finish_reason': 'closespider_timeout',\n 'finish_time': datetime.datetime(2016, 12, 16, 16, 19, 0, 647725),\n 'log_count/INFO': 17,\n 'request_depth_max': 19,\n 'response_received_count': 534,\n 'scheduler/dequeued': 533,\n 'scheduler/dequeued/memory': 533,\n 'scheduler/enqueued': 10661,\n 'scheduler/enqueued/memory': 10661,\n 'start_time': datetime.datetime(2016, 12, 16, 16, 18, 49, 799869)}\n2016-12-16 21:19:00 [scrapy.core.engine] INFO: Spider closed (closespider_timeout)\n```\n\nThat tells you that Scrapy is able to crawl about 3000 pages per minute in the hardware where you run it.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what asyncio is in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain asyncio in scrapy-latest.\n\n# asyncio\n\nScrapy has partial support for asyncio. After you install the asyncio reactor, you may use asyncio and asyncio-powered libraries in any coroutine.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Installing the asyncio reactor\n\nTo enable asyncio support, set the TWISTED_REACTOR setting to 'twisted.internet.asyncioreactor.AsyncioSelectorReactor'.\n\nIf you are using CrawlerRunner, you also need to install the AsyncioSelectorReactor reactor manually. You can do that using install_reactor():\n\n```\ninstall_reactor('twisted.internet.asyncioreactor.AsyncioSelectorReactor')\n```\n\n## Handling a pre-installed reactor\n\ntwisted.internet.reactor and some other Twisted imports install the default Twisted reactor as a side effect. Once a Twisted reactor is installed, it is not possible to switch to a different reactor at run time.\n\nIf you configure the asyncio Twisted reactor and, at run time, Scrapy complains that a different reactor is already installed, chances are you have some such imports in your code.\n\nYou can usually fix the issue by moving those offending module-level Twisted imports to the method or function definitions where they are used. For example, if you have something like:\n\n```\nfrom twisted.internet import reactor\n\ndef my_function():\n    reactor.callLater(...)\n```\n\nSwitch to something like:\n\n```\ndef my_function():\n    from twisted.internet import reactor\n\n    reactor.callLater(...)\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can try to manually install the asyncio reactor, with install_reactor(), before those imports happen.\n\n## Awaiting on Deferreds\n\nWhen the asyncio reactor isn’t installed, you can await on Deferreds in the coroutines directly. When it is installed, this is not possible anymore, due to specifics of the Scrapy coroutine integration (the coroutines are wrapped into asyncio.Future objects, not into Deferred directly), and you need to wrap them into Futures. Scrapy provides two helpers for this:\n\nscrapy.utils.defer.deferred_to_future( _d:Deferred[_T]_)→Future[_T]\n\nNew in version 2.6.0.\n\nReturn an asyncio.Future object that wraps _d_.\n\nWhen using the asyncio reactor, you cannot await on Deferred objects from Scrapy callables defined as coroutines, you can only await on Future objects. Wrapping Deferred objects into Future objects allows you to wait on them:\n\n```\nclass MySpider(Spider):\n    ...\n    async def parse(self, response):\n        additional_request = scrapy.Request('https://example.org/price')\n        deferred = self.crawler.engine.download(additional_request)\n        additional_response = await deferred_to_future(deferred)\n```\n\nscrapy.utils.defer.maybe_deferred_to_future( _d:Deferred[_T]_)→Deferred[_T]|Future[_T]\n\nNew in version 2.6.0.\n\nReturn _d_ as an object that can be awaited from a Scrapy callable defined as a coroutine.\n\nWhat you can await in Scrapy callables defined as coroutines depends on the value of TWISTED_REACTOR:\n\n- When not using the asyncio reactor, you can only await on Deferred objects.\n- When using the asyncio reactor, you can only await on asyncio.Future objects.\n\nIf you want to write code that uses Deferred objects but works with any reactor, use this function on all Deferred objects:\n\n```\nclass MySpider(Spider):\n    ...\n    async def parse(self, response):\n        additional_request = scrapy.Request('https://example.org/price')\n        deferred = self.crawler.engine.download(additional_request)\n        additional_response = await maybe_deferred_to_future(deferred)\n```\n\n## Enforcing asyncio as a requirement\n\nIf you are writing a component that requires asyncio to work, use scrapy.utils.reactor.is_asyncio_reactor_installed() to enforce it as a requirement. For example:\n\n```\nfrom scrapy.utils.reactor import is_asyncio_reactor_installed\n\nclass MyComponent:\n    def __init__(self):\n        if not is_asyncio_reactor_installed():\n            raise ValueError(\n                f\"{MyComponent.__qualname__} requires the asyncio Twisted \"\n                f\"reactor. Make sure you have it configured in the \"\n                f\"TWISTED_REACTOR setting. See the asyncio documentation \"\n                f\"of Scrapy for more information.\"\n            )\n```\n\n## Windows-specific notes\n\nThe Windows implementation of asyncio can use two event loop implementations, ProactorEventLoop (default) and SelectorEventLoop. However, only SelectorEventLoop works with Twisted.\n\nScrapy changes the event loop class to SelectorEventLoop automatically when you change the TWISTED_REACTOR setting or call install_reactor().\n\nNote: Other libraries you use may require ProactorEventLoop, e.g. because it supports subprocesses (this is the case with playwright), so you cannot use them together with Scrapy on Windows (but you should be able to use them on WSL or native Linux).\n\n## Using custom asyncio loops\n\nYou can also use custom asyncio event loops with the asyncio reactor. Set the ASYNCIO_EVENT_LOOP setting to the import path of the desired event loop class to use it instead of the default asyncio event loop.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/asyncio.html", "title": "asyncio", "description": "Scrapy has partial support for asyncio.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Logging is in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Logging in scrapy-latest.\n\n# Logging\n\nScrapy uses logging for event logging. This page provides an overview of how to log messages, configure logging, and customize log formats in Scrapy.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Log levels\n\nPython’s builtin logging defines 5 different levels to indicate the severity of a given log message. Here are the standard ones, listed in decreasing order:\n\n1. `logging.CRITICAL` - for critical errors (highest severity)\n2. `logging.ERROR` - for regular errors\n3. `logging.WARNING` - for warning messages\n4. `logging.INFO` - for informational messages\n5. `logging.DEBUG` - for debugging messages (lowest severity)\n\n## How to log messages\n\nHere’s a quick example of how to log a message using the `logging.WARNING` level:\n\n```\nimport logging\n\nlogging.warning(\"This is a warning\")\n```\n\nThere are shortcuts for issuing log messages on any of the standard 5 levels, and there’s also a general `logging.log` method which takes a given level as argument. If needed, the last example could be rewritten as:\n\n```\nimport logging\n\nlogging.log(logging.WARNING, \"This is a warning\")\n```\n\nOn top of that, you can create different “loggers” to encapsulate messages. (For example, a common practice is to create different loggers for every module). These loggers can be configured independently, and they allow hierarchical constructions.\n\nThe previous examples use the root logger behind the scenes, which is a top level logger where all messages are propagated to (unless otherwise specified). Using `logging` helpers is merely a shortcut for getting the root logger explicitly, so this is also an equivalent of the last snippets:\n\n```\nimport logging\n\nlogger = logging.getLogger()\nlogger.warning(\"This is a warning\")\n```\n\nYou can use a different logger just by getting its name with the `logging.getLogger` function:\n\n```\nimport logging\n\nlogger = logging.getLogger(\"mycustomlogger\")\nlogger.warning(\"This is a warning\")\n```\n\nFinally, you can ensure having a custom logger for any module you’re working on by using the `__name__` variable, which is populated with current module’s path:\n\n```\nimport logging\n\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\nlogger.warning(\"This is a warning\")\n```\n\n## Logging from Spiders\n\nScrapy provides a `logger` within each Spider instance, which can be accessed and used like this:\n\n```\nimport scrapy\n\nclass MySpider(scrapy.Spider):\n    name = \"myspider\"\n    start_urls = [\"https://scrapy.org\"]\n\n    def parse(self, response):\n        self.logger.info(\"Parse function called on %s\", response.url)\n```\n\nThat logger is created using the Spider’s name, but you can use any custom Python logger you want. For example:\n\n```\nimport logging\nimport scrapy\n\nlogger = logging.getLogger(\"mycustomlogger\")\n\nclass MySpider(scrapy.Spider):\n    name = \"myspider\"\n    start_urls = [\"https://scrapy.org\"]\n\n    def parse(self, response):\n        logger.info(\"Parse function called on %s\", response.url)\n```\n\n## Logging configuration\n\nLoggers on their own don’t manage how messages sent through them are displayed. For this task, different “handlers” can be attached to any logger instance and they will redirect those messages to appropriate destinations, such as the standard output, files, emails, etc.\n\nBy default, Scrapy sets and configures a handler for the root logger, based on the settings below.\n\n## Command-line options\n\nThere are command-line arguments, available for all commands, that you can use to override some of the Scrapy settings regarding logging.\n\n- `--logfile FILE`\n\nOverrides [`LOG_FILE`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html#std-setting-LOG_FILE)\n\n- `--loglevel/-L LEVEL`\n\nOverrides [`LOG_LEVEL`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html#std-setting-LOG_LEVEL)\n\n- `--nolog`\n\nSets [`LOG_ENABLED`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html#std-setting-LOG_ENABLED) to `False`\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/logging.html", "title": "Logging", "description": "Scrapy uses logging for event logging.

middleware](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spider-middleware.html#topics-spider-middleware) of the specified class or a subclass, or `None` if none is found.\n\n## CrawlerRunner class\n\nThis is a convenient helper class that keeps track of, manages and runs crawlers inside an already setup [`reactor`](https://docs.twisted.org/en/stable/api/twisted.internet.reactor.html \"(in Twisted)\").\n\nThe CrawlerRunner object must be instantiated with a [`Settings`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/api.html#scrapy.settings.Settings \"scrapy.settings.Settings\") object.\n\n## crawl method of CrawlerRunner\n\nRun a crawler with the provided arguments.\n\nIt will call the given Crawler’s [`crawl()`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/api.html#scrapy.crawler.Crawler.crawl \"scrapy.crawler.Crawler.crawl\") method, while keeping track of it so it can be stopped later.\n\n## create_crawler method\n\nReturn a [`Crawler`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/api.html#scrapy.crawler.Crawler \"scrapy.crawler.Crawler\") object.\n\n## join method\n\nReturns a deferred that is fired when all managed [`crawlers`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/api.html#scrapy.crawler.CrawlerRunner.crawlers \"scrapy.crawler.CrawlerRunner.crawlers\") have completed their executions.\n\n## stop method of CrawlerRunner\n\nStops simultaneously all the crawling jobs taking place.\n\n## CrawlerProcess class\n\nA class to run multiple scrapy crawlers in a process simultaneously.\n\n## crawl method of CrawlerProcess\n\nRun a crawler with the provided arguments.\n\n## start method of CrawlerProcess\n\nThis method starts a [`reactor`](https://docs.twisted.org/en/stable/api/twisted.internet.reactor.html \"(in Twisted)\").\n\n## Settings API\n\nscrapy.settings.SETTINGS_PRIORITIES

settings priorities used in Scrapy.\n\n## get_settings_priority method\n\nSmall helper function that looks up a given string priority in the [`SETTINGS_PRIORITIES`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/api.html#scrapy.settings.SETTINGS_PRIORITIES \"scrapy.settings.SETTINGS_PRIORITIES\") dictionary and returns its numerical value, or directly returns a given numerical priority.\n\n## Settings class\n\nThis object stores Scrapy settings for the configuration of internal components, and can be used for any further customization.\n\n## BaseSettings class\n\nInstances of this class behave like dictionaries, but store priorities along with their `(key, value)` pairs, and can be frozen (i.e. marked

{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Jobs: pausing and resuming crawls is in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Jobs: pausing and resuming crawls in scrapy-latest.\n\n# Jobs: pausing and resuming crawls\n\nSometimes, for big sites, it’s desirable to pause crawls and be able to resume them later. Scrapy supports this functionality out of the box by providing the following facilities: a scheduler that persists scheduled requests on disk, a duplicates filter that persists visited requests on disk, and an extension that keeps some spider state (key/value pairs) persistent between batches.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Job directory\n\nTo enable persistence support you just need to define a _job directory_ through the `JOBDIR` setting. This directory will be for storing all required data to keep the state of a single job (i.e. a spider run). It’s important to note that this directory must not be shared by different spiders, or even different jobs/runs of the same spider, as it’s meant to be used for storing the state of a _single_ job.\n\n## How to use it\n\nTo start a spider with persistence support enabled, run it like this:\n\n```\nscrapy crawl somespider -s JOBDIR=crawls/somespider-1\n```\n\nThen, you can stop the spider safely at any time (by pressing Ctrl-C or sending a signal), and resume it later by issuing the same command:\n\n```\nscrapy crawl somespider -s JOBDIR=crawls/somespider-1\n```\n\n## Keeping persistent state between batches\n\nSometimes you’ll want to keep some persistent spider state between pause/resume batches. You can use the `spider.state` attribute for that, which should be a dict. There’s [a built-in extension](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/extensions.html#topics-extensions-ref-spiderstate) that takes care of serializing, storing and loading that attribute from the job directory, when the spider starts and stops.\n\nHere’s an example of a callback that uses the spider state (other spider code is omitted for brevity):\n\n```\ndef parse_item(self, response):\n    # parse item here\n    self.state[\"items_count\"] = self.state.get(\"items_count\", 0) + 1\n```\n\n## Persistence gotchas\n\nThere are a few things to keep in mind if you want to be able to use the Scrapy persistence support:\n\n### Cookies expiration\nCookies may expire. So, if you don’t resume your spider quickly the requests scheduled may no longer work. This won’t be an issue if your spider doesn’t rely on cookies.\n\n### Request serialization\nFor persistence to work, `Request` objects must be serializable with [`pickle`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#module-pickle), except for the `callback` and `errback` values passed to their `__init__` method, which must be methods of the running [`Spider`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spiders.html#scrapy.Spider) class.\n\nIf you wish to log the requests that couldn’t be serialized, you can set the [`SCHEDULER_DEBUG`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html#std-setting-SCHEDULER_DEBUG) setting to `True` in the project’s settings page. It is `False` by default.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/jobs.html", "title": "Jobs: pausing and resuming crawls", "description": "Sometimes, for big sites, it’s desirable to pause crawls and be able to resume them later.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Installation guide is in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Installation guide in scrapy-latest.\n\n# Installation guide\n\nThis page provides detailed instructions on how to install Scrapy, including supported Python versions, installation methods, and platform-specific notes.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Supported Python versions\n\nScrapy requires Python 3.9+, either the CPython implementation (default) or the PyPy implementation (see Alternate Implementations).\n\n## Installing Scrapy\n\nIf you’re using Anaconda or Miniconda, you can install the package from the conda-forge channel, which has up-to-date packages for Linux, Windows and macOS.\n\nTo install Scrapy using `conda`, run:\n\n```\nconda install -c conda-forge scrapy\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you’re already familiar with installation of Python packages, you can install Scrapy and its dependencies from PyPI with:\n\n```\npip install Scrapy\n```\n\nWe strongly recommend that you install Scrapy in a dedicated virtualenv, to avoid conflicting with your system packages.\n\nNote that sometimes this may require solving compilation issues for some Scrapy dependencies depending on your operating system, so be sure to check the Platform specific installation notes.\n\n## Things that are good to know\n\nScrapy is written in pure Python and depends on a few key Python packages (among others):\n\n- lxml, an efficient XML and HTML parser\n- parsel, an HTML/XML data extraction library written on top of lxml,\n- w3lib, a multi-purpose helper for dealing with URLs and web page encodings\n- twisted, an asynchronous networking framework\n- cryptography and pyOpenSSL, to deal with various network-level security needs\n\nSome of these packages themselves depend on non-Python packages that might require additional installation steps depending on your platform.\n\n## Using a virtual environment (recommended)\n\nTL;DR: We recommend installing Scrapy inside a virtual environment on all platforms.\n\nPython packages can be installed either globally (a.k.a system wide), or in user-space. We do not recommend installing Scrapy system wide.\n\nInstead, we recommend that you install Scrapy within a so-called “virtual environment” (venv). Virtual environments allow you to not conflict with already-installed Python system packages and still install packages normally with `pip`.\n\n## Platform specific installation notes\n\n### Windows\nThough it’s possible to install Scrapy on Windows using pip, we recommend you install Anaconda or Miniconda and use the package from the conda-forge channel, which will avoid most installation issues.\n\nTo install Scrapy on Windows using `pip`:\n\n1. Download and execute Microsoft C++ Build Tools to install the Visual Studio Installer.\n2. Run the Visual Studio Installer.\n3. Under the Workloads section, select **C++ build tools**.\n4. Check the installation details and make sure following packages are selected as optional components:\n   - **MSVC** (e.g MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C++ x64/x86 build tools (v14.23))\n   - **Windows SDK** (e.g Windows 10 SDK (10.0.18362.0))\n5. Install the Visual Studio Build Tools.\n\nNow, you should be able to install Scrapy using `pip`.\n\n### Ubuntu 14.04 or above\nScrapy is currently tested with recent-enough versions of lxml, twisted and pyOpenSSL, and is compatible with recent Ubuntu distributions. But it should support older versions of Ubuntu too, like Ubuntu 14.04, albeit with potential issues with TLS connections.\n\nTo install Scrapy on Ubuntu (or Ubuntu-based) systems, you need to install these dependencies:\n\n```\nsudo apt-get install python3 python3-dev python3-pip libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev zlib1g-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev\n```\n\nInside a virtualenv, you can install Scrapy with `pip` after that:\n\n```\npip install scrapy\n```\n\n### macOS\nBuilding Scrapy’s dependencies requires the presence of a C compiler and development headers. On macOS this is typically provided by Apple’s Xcode development tools. To install the Xcode command-line tools, open a terminal window and run:\n\n```\nxcode-select --install\n```\n\nAfter any of these workarounds you should be able to install Scrapy:\n\n```\npip install Scrapy\n```\n\n### PyPy\nWe recommend using the latest PyPy version. For PyPy3, only Linux installation was tested.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### AttributeError: ‘module’ object has no attribute ‘OP_NO_TLSv1_1’\nAfter you install or upgrade Scrapy, Twisted or pyOpenSSL, you may get an exception with the following traceback:\n\n```\n[…]\n  File \"[…]/site-packages/twisted/protocols/tls.py\", line 63, in <module>\n    from twisted.internet._sslverify import _setAcceptableProtocols\n  File \"[…]/site-packages/twisted/internet/_sslverify.py\", line 38, in <module>\n    TLSVersion.TLSv1_1: SSL.OP_NO_TLSv1_1,\nAttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'OP_NO_TLSv1_1'\n```\n\nTo install a version of pyOpenSSL that your version of Twisted supports, reinstall Twisted with the `tls` extra option:\n\n```\npip install twisted[tls]\n```\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/install.html", "title": "Installation guide", "description": "This page provides detailed instructions on how to install Scrapy, including supported Python versions, installation methods, and platform-specific notes.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 6, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 03:35:51", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "generator": "Docutils 0.19: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/", "title": "Installation guide — Scrapy 2.12.0 documentation", "readthedocs-version-slug": "latest", "readthedocs-resolver-filename": "/intro/install.html", "readthedocs-http-status": "200", "readthedocs-project-slug": "scrapy", "language": "en", "scrapeId": "354e8929-b7f6-40b2-9c27-0a696c193a4b", "sourceURL": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/install.html", "url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/install.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Settings is in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Settings in scrapy-latest.\n\n# Settings\n\nThe Scrapy settings allows you to customize the behaviour of all Scrapy components, including the core, extensions, pipelines and spiders themselves.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Designating the settings\n\nWhen you use Scrapy, you have to tell it which settings you’re using. You can do this by using an environment variable, `SCRAPY_SETTINGS_MODULE`. The value of `SCRAPY_SETTINGS_MODULE` should be in Python path syntax, e.g. `myproject.settings`. Note that the settings module should be on the Python [import search path](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#tut-searchpath \"(in Python v3.13)\").\n\n## Populating the settings\n\nSettings can be populated using different mechanisms, each of which having a different precedence. Here is the list of them in decreasing order of precedence:\n\n1. Command line options (most precedence)\n2. Settings per-spider\n3. Project settings module\n4. Settings set by add-ons\n5. Default settings per-command\n6. Default global settings (less precedence)\n\nThe population of these settings sources is taken care of internally, but a manual handling is possible using API calls. See the [Settings API](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/api.html#topics-api-settings) topic for reference.\n\n## 1. Command line options\n\nArguments provided by the command line are the ones that take most precedence, overriding any other options. You can explicitly override one (or more) settings using the `-s` (or `--set`) command line option.\n\nExample:\n```\nscrapy crawl myspider -s LOG_FILE=scrapy.log\n```\n\n## 2. Settings per-spider\n\nSpiders (See the [Spiders](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spiders.html#topics-spiders) chapter for reference) can define their own settings that will take precedence and override the project ones. One way to do so is by setting their [`custom_settings`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spiders.html#scrapy.Spider.custom_settings \"scrapy.Spider.custom_settings\") attribute:\n\n```\nimport scrapy\n\nclass MySpider(scrapy.Spider):\n    name = \"myspider\"\n\n    custom_settings = {\n        \"SOME_SETTING\": \"some value\",\n    }\n```\n\nIt’s often better to implement [`update_settings()`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spiders.html#scrapy.Spider.update_settings \"scrapy.Spider.update_settings\") instead, and settings set there should use the “spider” priority explicitly:\n\n```\nimport scrapy\n\nclass MySpider(scrapy.Spider):\n    name = \"myspider\"\n\n    @classmethod\n    def update_settings(cls, settings):\n        super().update_settings(settings)\n        settings.set(\"SOME_SETTING\", \"some value\", priority=\"spider\")\n```\n\nNew in version 2.11.\n\nIt’s also possible to modify the settings in the [`from_crawler()`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spiders.html#scrapy.Spider.from_crawler \"scrapy.Spider.from_crawler\") method, e.g. based on [spider arguments](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spiders.html#spiderargs) or other logic:\n\n```\nimport scrapy\n\nclass MySpider(scrapy.Spider):\n    name = \"myspider\"\n\n    @classmethod\n    def from_crawler(cls, crawler, *args, **kwargs):\n        spider = super().from_crawler(crawler, *args, **kwargs)\n        if \"some_argument\" in kwargs:\n            spider.settings.set(\n                \"SOME_SETTING\", kwargs[\"some_argument\"], priority=\"spider\"\n            )\n        return spider\n```\n\n## 3. Project settings module\n\nThe project settings module is the standard configuration file for your Scrapy project, it’s where most of your custom settings will be populated. For a standard Scrapy project, this means you’ll be adding or changing the settings in the `settings.py` file created for your project.\n\n## 4. Settings set by add-ons\n\n[Add-ons](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/addons.html#topics-addons) can modify settings. They should do this with this priority, though this is not enforced.\n\n## 5. Default settings per-command\n\nEach [Scrapy tool](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/commands.html) command can have its own default settings, which override the global default settings. Those custom command settings are specified in the `default_settings` attribute of the command class.\n\n## 6. Default global settings\n\nThe global defaults are located in the `scrapy.settings.default_settings` module and documented in the [Built-in settings reference](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html#topics-settings-ref) section.\n\n## Compatibility with pickle\n\nSetting values must be [picklable](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#pickle-picklable \"(in Python v3.13)\").\n\n## Import paths and classes\n\nNew in version 2.4.0.\n\nWhen a setting references a callable object to be imported by Scrapy, such as a class or a function, there are two different ways you can specify that object:\n\n- As a string containing the import path of that object\n- As the object itself\n\nFor example:\n```\nfrom mybot.pipelines.validate import ValidateMyItem\n\nITEM_PIPELINES = {\n    # passing the classname...\n    ValidateMyItem: 300,\n    # ...equals passing the class path\n    \"mybot.pipelines.validate.ValidateMyItem\": 300,\n}\n```\n\nNote\n\nPassing non-callable objects is not supported.\n\n## How to access settings\n\nIn a spider, the settings are available through `self.settings`:\n```\nclass MySpider(scrapy.Spider):\n    name = \"myspider\"\n    start_urls = [\"http://example.com\"]\n\n    def parse(self, response):\n        print(f\"Existing settings: {self.settings.attributes.keys()}\")\n```\n\nNote\n\nThe `settings` attribute is set in the base Spider class after the spider is initialized. If you want to use the settings before the initialization (e.g., in your spider’s `__init__()` method), you’ll need to override the [`from_crawler()`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spiders.html#scrapy.Spider.from_crawler \"scrapy.Spider.from_crawler\") method.\n\nSettings can be accessed through the [`scrapy.crawler.Crawler.settings`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/api.html#scrapy.crawler.Crawler.settings \"scrapy.crawler.Crawler.settings\") attribute of the Crawler that is passed to `from_crawler` method in extensions, middlewares and item pipelines:\n```\nclass MyExtension:\n    def __init__(self, log_is_enabled=False):\n        if log_is_enabled:\n            print(\"log is enabled!\")\n\n    @classmethod\n    def from_crawler(cls, crawler):\n        settings = crawler.settings\n        return cls(settings.getbool(\"LOG_ENABLED\"))\n```\n\nThe settings object can be used like a dict (e.g., `settings['LOG_ENABLED']`), but it’s usually preferred to extract the setting in the format you need it to avoid type errors, using one of the methods provided by the [`Settings`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/api.html#scrapy.settings.Settings \"scrapy.settings.Settings\") API.\n\n## Rationale for setting names\n\nSetting names are usually prefixed with the component that they configure. For example, proper setting names for a fictional robots.txt extension would be `ROBOTSTXT_ENABLED`, `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY`, `ROBOTSTXT_CACHEDIR`, etc.\n\n## Built-in settings reference\n\nHere’s a list of all available Scrapy settings, in alphabetical order, along with their default values and the scope where they apply. The scope, where available, shows where the setting is being used, if it’s tied to any particular component. In that case the module of that component will be shown, typically an extension, middleware or pipeline. It also means that the component must be enabled in order for the setting to have any effect.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html", "title": "Settings", "description": "The Scrapy settings allows you to customize the behaviour of all Scrapy components, including the core, extensions, pipelines and spiders themselves.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 13, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 03:36:45", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "readthedocs-resolver-filename": "/topics/settings.html", "readthedocs-project-slug": "scrapy", "title": "Settings — Scrapy 2.12.0 documentation", "generator": "Docutils 0.19: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/", "readthedocs-http-status": "200", "language": "en", "readthedocs-version-slug": "latest", "scrapeId": "aef216ba-3a0d-41f4-991e-611dbe4f34ec", "sourceURL": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html", "url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Scrapy at a glance is in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Scrapy at a glance in scrapy-latest.\n\n# Scrapy at a glance\n\nScrapy is an application framework for crawling web sites and extracting structured data which can be used for a wide range of useful applications, like data mining, information processing or historical archival.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Walk-through of an example spider\n\nIn order to show you what Scrapy brings to the table, we’ll walk you through an example of a Scrapy Spider using the simplest way to run a spider.\n\nHere’s the code for a spider that scrapes famous quotes from website https://quotes.toscrape.com, following the pagination:\n\n```python\nimport scrapy\n\nclass QuotesSpider(scrapy.Spider):\n    name = \"quotes\"\n    start_urls = [\\\n        \"https://quotes.toscrape.com/tag/humor/\",\\\n    ]\n\n    def parse(self, response):\n        for quote in response.css(\"div.quote\"):\n            yield {\n                \"author\": quote.xpath(\"span/small/text()\").get(),\n                \"text\": quote.css(\"span.text::text\").get(),\n            }\n\n        next_page = response.css('li.next a::attr(\"href\")').get()\n        if next_page is not None:\n            yield response.follow(next_page, self.parse)\n```\n\nPut this in a text file, name it something like `quotes_spider.py` and run the spider using the [`runspider`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/commands.html#std-command-runspider) command:\n\n```\nscrapy runspider quotes_spider.py -o quotes.jsonl\n```\n\nWhen this finishes you will have in the `quotes.jsonl` file a list of the quotes in JSON Lines format, containing the text and author, which will look like this:\n\n```\n{\"author\": \"Jane Austen\", \"text\": \"\\u201cThe person, be it gentleman or lady, who has not pleasure in a good novel, must be intolerably stupid.\\u201d\"}\n{\"author\": \"Steve Martin\", \"text\": \"\\u201cA day without sunshine is like, you know, night.\\u201d\"}\n{\"author\": \"Garrison Keillor\", \"text\": \"\\u201cAnyone who thinks sitting in church can make you a Christian must also think that sitting in a garage can make you a car.\\u201d\"}\n...\n```\n\n## What just happened?\n\nWhen you ran the command `scrapy runspider quotes_spider.py`, Scrapy looked for a Spider definition inside it and ran it through its crawler engine.\n\nThe crawl started by making requests to the URLs defined in the `start_urls` attribute (in this case, only the URL for quotes in the _humor_ category) and called the default callback method `parse`, passing the response object as an argument. In the `parse` callback, we loop through the quote elements using a CSS Selector, yield a Python dict with the extracted quote text and author, look for a link to the next page and schedule another request using the same `parse` method as callback.\n\nHere you will notice one of the main advantages of Scrapy: requests are [scheduled and processed asynchronously](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/architecture.html#topics-architecture). This means that Scrapy doesn’t need to wait for a request to be finished and processed, it can send another request or do other things in the meantime. This also means that other requests can keep going even if a request fails or an error happens while handling it.\n\nWhile this enables you to do very fast crawls (sending multiple concurrent requests at the same time, in a fault-tolerant way) Scrapy also gives you control over the politeness of the crawl through [a few settings](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html#topics-settings-ref). You can do things like setting a download delay between each request, limiting the amount of concurrent requests per domain or per IP, and even [using an auto-throttling extension](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/autothrottle.html#topics-autothrottle) that tries to figure these settings out automatically.\n\nNote\n\nThis is using [feed exports](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/feed-exports.html#topics-feed-exports) to generate the JSON file, you can easily change the export format (XML or CSV, for example) or the storage backend (FTP or [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), for example). You can also write an [item pipeline](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/item-pipeline.html#topics-item-pipeline) to store the items in a database.\n\n## What else?\n\nYou’ve seen how to extract and store items from a website using Scrapy, but this is just the surface. Scrapy provides a lot of powerful features for making scraping easy and efficient, such as:\n\n- Built-in support for [selecting and extracting](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/selectors.html#topics-selectors) data from HTML/XML sources using extended CSS selectors and XPath expressions, with helper methods for extraction using regular expressions.\n\n- An [interactive shell console](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/shell.html#topics-shell) (IPython aware) for trying out the CSS and XPath expressions to scrape data, which is very useful when writing or debugging your spiders.\n\n- Built-in support for [generating feed exports](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/feed-exports.html#topics-feed-exports) in multiple formats (JSON, CSV, XML) and storing them in multiple backends (FTP, S3, local filesystem)\n\n- Robust encoding support and auto-detection, for dealing with foreign, non-standard and broken encoding declarations.\n\n- [Strong extensibility support](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/index.html#extending-scrapy), allowing you to plug in your own functionality using [signals](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/signals.html#topics-signals) and a well-defined API (middlewares, [extensions](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/extensions.html#topics-extensions), and [pipelines](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/item-pipeline.html#topics-item-pipeline)).\n\n- A wide range of built-in extensions and middlewares for handling:\n\n  - cookies and session handling\n\n  - HTTP features like compression, authentication, caching\n\n  - user-agent spoofing\n\n  - robots.txt\n\n  - crawl depth restriction\n\n  - and more\n- A [Telnet console](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/telnetconsole.html#topics-telnetconsole) for hooking into a Python console running inside your Scrapy process, to introspect and debug your crawler\n\n- Plus other goodies like reusable spiders to crawl sites from [Sitemaps](https://www.sitemaps.org/index.html) and XML/CSV feeds, a media pipeline for [automatically downloading images](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/media-pipeline.html#topics-media-pipeline) (or any other media) associated with the scraped items, a caching DNS resolver, and much more!\n\n## What’s next?\n\nThe next steps for you are to [install Scrapy](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/install.html#intro-install), [follow through the tutorial](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html#intro-tutorial) to learn how to create a full-blown Scrapy project and [join the community](https://scrapy.org/community/).

You can also write an [item pipeline](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/item-pipeline.html#topics-item-pipeline) to store the items in a database..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/overview.html", "title": "Scrapy at a glance", "description": "Scrapy is an application framework for crawling web sites and extracting structured data which can be used for a wide range of useful applications, like data mining, information processing or historical archival.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 4, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 03:38:13", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"readthedocs-resolver-filename": "/intro/overview.html", "language": "en", "readthedocs-version-slug": "latest", "generator": "Docutils 0.19: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/", "title": "Scrapy at a glance — Scrapy 2.12.0 documentation", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "readthedocs-project-slug": "scrapy", "readthedocs-http-status": "200", "scrapeId": "22973142-6bf2-47eb-a932-f95ab7588f8b", "sourceURL": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/overview.html", "url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/overview.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

That is, after all, the whole purpose of the scraping process. For this purpose Scrapy provides a collection of Item Exporters for different output formats, such as XML, CSV or JSON.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Using Item Exporters\n\nIf you are in a hurry, and just want to use an Item Exporter to output scraped data see the Feed exports. Otherwise, if you want to know how Item Exporters work or need more custom functionality (not covered by the default exports), continue reading below.\n\nIn order to use an Item Exporter, you must instantiate it with its required args. Each Item Exporter requires different arguments, so check each exporter documentation to be sure, in Built-in Item Exporters reference. After you have instantiated your exporter, you have to:\n\n1. call the method start_exporting() in order to signal the beginning of the exporting process\n\n2. call the export_item() method for each item you want to export\n\n3. and finally call the finish_exporting() to signal the end of the exporting process\n\nHere you can see an Item Pipeline which uses multiple Item Exporters to group scraped items to different files according to the value of one of their fields.\n\n## Serialization of item fields\n\nBy default, the field values are passed unmodified to the underlying serialization library, and the decision of how to serialize them is delegated to each particular serialization library.\n\nHowever, you can customize how each field value is serialized before it is passed to the serialization library.\n\nThere are two ways to customize how a field will be serialized, which are described next.\n\n## Declaring a serializer in the field\n\nIf you use Item you can declare a serializer in the field metadata. The serializer must be a callable which receives a value and returns its serialized form.\n\n## Overriding the serialize_field() method\n\nYou can also override the serialize_field() method to customize how your field value will be exported.\n\nMake sure you call the base class serialize_field() method after your custom code.\n\n## Built-in Item Exporters reference\n\nHere is a list of the Item Exporters bundled with Scrapy.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Debugging memory leaks is in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Debugging memory leaks in scrapy-latest.\n\n# Debugging memory leaks\n\nThis page covers how to debug memory leaks in Scrapy, including common causes, tools like trackref and muppy, and best practices for managing memory usage.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Debugging memory leaks\n\nIn Scrapy, objects such as requests, responses and items have a finite lifetime: they are created, used for a while, and finally destroyed.\n\nFrom all those objects, the Request is probably the one with the longest lifetime, as it stays waiting in the Scheduler queue until it’s time to process it. For more info see Architecture overview.\n\nAs these Scrapy objects have a (rather long) lifetime, there is always the risk of accumulating them in memory without releasing them properly and thus causing what is known as a “memory leak”.\n\nTo help debugging memory leaks, Scrapy provides a built-in mechanism for tracking objects references called trackref, and you can also use a third-party library called muppy for more advanced memory debugging (see below for more info). Both mechanisms must be used from the Telnet Console.\n\n## Common causes of memory leaks\n\nIt happens quite often (sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose) that the Scrapy developer passes objects referenced in Requests (for example, using the cb_kwargs or meta attributes or the request callback function) and that effectively bounds the lifetime of those referenced objects to the lifetime of the Request. This is, by far, the most common cause of memory leaks in Scrapy projects, and a quite difficult one to debug for newcomers.\n\nIn big projects, the spiders are typically written by different people and some of those spiders could be “leaking” and thus affecting the rest of the other (well-written) spiders when they get to run concurrently, which, in turn, affects the whole crawling process.\n\nThe leak could also come from a custom middleware, pipeline or extension that you have written, if you are not releasing the (previously allocated) resources properly. For example, allocating resources on spider_opened but not releasing them on spider_closed may cause problems if you’re running multiple spiders per process.\n\n## Too Many Requests?\n\nBy default Scrapy keeps the request queue in memory; it includes Request objects and all objects referenced in Request attributes (e.g. in cb_kwargs and meta). While not necessarily a leak, this can take a lot of memory. Enabling persistent job queue could help keeping memory usage in control.\n\n## Debugging memory leaks with trackref\n\ntrackref is a module provided by Scrapy to debug the most common cases of memory leaks. It basically tracks the references to all live Request, Response, Item, Spider and Selector objects.\n\nYou can enter the telnet console and inspect how many objects (of the classes mentioned above) are currently alive using the prefs() function which is an alias to the print_live_refs() function:\n\n```\ntelnet localhost 6023\n\n.. code-block:: pycon\n\n    >>> prefs()\n    Live References\n\n    ExampleSpider                       1   oldest: 15s ago\n    HtmlResponse                       10   oldest: 1s ago\n    Selector                            2   oldest: 0s ago\n    FormRequest                       878   oldest: 7s ago\n```\n\nAs you can see, that report also shows the “age” of the oldest object in each class. If you’re running multiple spiders per process chances are you can figure out which spider is leaking by looking at the oldest request or response. You can get the oldest object of each class using the get_oldest() function (from the telnet console).\n\n## Which objects are tracked?\n\nThe objects tracked by trackrefs are all from these classes (and all its subclasses):\n\n- scrapy.Request\n- scrapy.http.Response\n- scrapy.Item\n- scrapy.Selector\n- scrapy.Spider\n\n## A real example\n\nLet’s see a concrete example of a hypothetical case of memory leaks. Suppose we have some spider with a line similar to this one:\n\n```\nreturn Request(f\"http://www.somenastyspider.com/product.php?pid={product_id}\",\n               callback=self.parse, cb_kwargs={'referer': response})\n```\n\nThat line is passing a response reference inside a request which effectively ties the response lifetime to the requests’ one, and that would definitely cause memory leaks.\n\nLet’s see how we can discover the cause (without knowing it a priori, of course) by using the trackref tool.\n\nAfter the crawler is running for a few minutes and we notice its memory usage has grown a lot, we can enter its telnet console and check the live references:\n\n```\n>>> prefs()\nLive References\n\nSomenastySpider                     1   oldest: 15s ago\nHtmlResponse                     3890   oldest: 265s ago\nSelector                            2   oldest: 0s ago\nRequest                          3878   oldest: 250s ago\n```\n\nThe fact that there are so many live responses (and that they’re so old) is definitely suspicious, as responses should have a relatively short lifetime compared to Requests. The number of responses is similar to the number of requests, so it looks like they are tied in a some way. We can now go and check the code of the spider to discover the nasty line that is generating the leaks (passing response references inside requests).\n\nSometimes extra information about live objects can be helpful. Let’s check the oldest response:\n\n```\n>>> from scrapy.utils.trackref import get_oldest\n>>> r = get_oldest(\"HtmlResponse\")\n>>> r.url\n'http://www.somenastyspider.com/product.php?pid=123'\n```\n\nIf you want to iterate over all objects, instead of getting the oldest one, you can use the scrapy.utils.trackref.iter_all() function:\n\n```\n>>> from scrapy.utils.trackref import iter_all\n>>> [r.url for r in iter_all(\"HtmlResponse\")]\n['http://www.somenastyspider.com/product.php?pid=123',\n'http://www.somenastyspider.com/product.php?pid=584',\n...]\n```\n\n## Too many spiders?\n\nIf your project has too many spiders executed in parallel, the output of prefs() can be difficult to read. For this reason, that function has a ignore argument which can be used to ignore a particular class (and all its subclasses). For example, this won’t show any live references to spiders:\n\n```\n>>> from scrapy.spiders import Spider\n>>> prefs(ignore=Spider)\n```\n\n## scrapy.utils.trackref module\n\nHere are the functions available in the trackref module.\n\nclass scrapy.utils.trackref.object_ref [source]\nInherit from this class if you want to track live instances with the trackref module.\n\nscrapy.utils.trackref.print_live_refs( class_name, ignore=None)\nPrint a report of live references, grouped by class name.\n\nParameters:\n\nignore (type or tuple) – if given, all objects from the specified class (or tuple of classes) will be ignored.\n\nscrapy.utils.trackref.get_oldest( class_name)\nReturn the oldest object alive with the given class name, or None if none is found. Use print_live_refs() first to get a list of all tracked live objects per class name.\n\nscrapy.utils.trackref.iter_all( class_name)\nReturn an iterator over all objects alive with the given class name, or None if none is found. Use print_live_refs() first to get a list of all tracked live objects per class name.\n\n## Debugging memory leaks with muppy\n\ntrackref provides a very convenient mechanism for tracking down memory leaks, but it only keeps track of the objects that are more likely to cause memory leaks. However, there are other cases where the memory leaks could come from other (more or less obscure) objects. If this is your case, and you can’t find your leaks using trackref, you still have another resource: the muppy library.\n\nYou can use muppy from Pympler.\n\nIf you use pip, you can install muppy with the following command:\n\n```\npip install Pympler\n```\n\nHere’s an example to view all Python objects available in the heap using muppy:\n\n```\n>>> from pympler import muppy\n>>> all_objects = muppy.get_objects()\n>>> len(all_objects)\n28667\n>>> from pympler import summary\n>>> suml = summary.summarize(all_objects)\n>>> summary.print_(suml)\n                               types |   # objects |   total size\n==================================== | =========== | ==========\n                         <class 'str |        9822 |      1.10 MB\n                        <class 'dict |        1658 |    856.62 KB\n                        <class 'type |         436 |    443.60 KB\n                        <class 'code |        2974 |    419.56 KB\n          <class '_io.BufferedWriter |           2 |    256.34 KB\n                         <class 'set |         420 |    159.88 KB\n          <class '_io.BufferedReader |           1 |    128.17 KB\n          <class 'wrapper_descriptor |        1130 |     88.28 KB\n                       <class 'tuple |        1304 |     86.57 KB\n                     <class 'weakref |        1013 |     79.14 KB\n  <class 'builtin_function_or_method |         958 |     67.36 KB\n           <class 'method_descriptor |         865 |     60.82 KB\n                 <class 'abc.ABCMeta |          62 |     59.96 KB\n                        <class 'list |         446 |     58.52 KB\n                         <class 'int |        1425 |     43.20 KB\n```\n\nFor more info about muppy, refer to the muppy documentation.\n\n## Leaks without leaks\n\nSometimes, you may notice that the memory usage of your Scrapy process will only increase, but never decrease. Unfortunately, this could happen even though neither Scrapy nor your project are leaking memory. This is due to a (not so well) known problem of Python, which may not return released memory to the operating system in some cases. For more information on this issue see:\n\n- Python Memory Management\n- Python Memory Management Part 2\n- Python Memory Management Part 3\n\nThe improvements proposed by Evan Jones, which are detailed in this paper, got merged in Python 2.5, but this only reduces the problem, it doesn’t fix it completely. To quote the paper:\n\n> _Unfortunately, this patch can only free an arena if there are no more_\n> _objects allocated in it anymore. This means that fragmentation is a large_\n> _issue. An application could have many megabytes of free memory, scattered_\n> _throughout all the arenas, but it will be unable to free any of it. This is_\n> _a problem experienced by all memory allocators. The only way to solve it is_\n> _to move to a compacting garbage collector, which is able to move objects in_\n> _memory. This would require significant changes to the Python interpreter._\n\nTo keep memory consumption reasonable you can split the job into several smaller jobs or enable persistent job queue and stop/start spider from time to time.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/leaks.html", "title": "Debugging memory leaks", "description": "This page covers how to debug memory leaks in Scrapy, including common causes, tools like trackref and muppy, and best practices for managing memory usage.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 10, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 03:41:48", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "readthedocs-resolver-filename": "/topics/leaks.html", "readthedocs-http-status": "200", "language": "en", "readthedocs-project-slug": "scrapy", "readthedocs-version-slug": "latest", "title": "Debugging memory leaks — Scrapy 2.12.0 documentation", "generator": "Docutils 0.19: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/", "scrapeId": "87d5accd-983e-4609-8d88-2e5d7bc9e563", "sourceURL": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/leaks.html", "url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/leaks.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

Let’s check the oldest response:\n\n```\n>>> from scrapy.utils.trackref import get_oldest\n>>> r = get_oldest(\"HtmlResponse\")\n>>> r.url\n'http://www.somenastyspider.com/product.php?pid=123'\n```\n\nIf you want to iterate over all objects, instead of getting the oldest one, you can use the scrapy.utils.trackref.iter_all() function:\n\n```\n>>> from scrapy.utils.trackref import iter_all\n>>> [r.url for r in iter_all(\"HtmlResponse\")]\n['http://www.somenastyspider.com/product.php?pid=123',\n'http://www.somenastyspider.com/product.php?pid=584',\n...]\n```.\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/leaks.html", "title": "Debugging memory leaks", "description": "This page covers how to debug memory leaks in Scrapy, including common causes, tools like trackref and muppy, and best practices for managing memory usage.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 10, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 03:41:48", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "readthedocs-resolver-filename": "/topics/leaks.html", "readthedocs-http-status": "200", "language": "en", "readthedocs-project-slug": "scrapy", "readthedocs-version-slug": "latest", "title": "Debugging memory leaks — Scrapy 2.12.0 documentation", "generator": "Docutils 0.19: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/", "scrapeId": "87d5accd-983e-4609-8d88-2e5d7bc9e563", "sourceURL": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/leaks.html", "url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/leaks.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: How do I debugging memory leaks with muppy in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: To debugging memory leaks with muppy in scrapy-latest, here's what you do:\ntrackref provides a very convenient mechanism for tracking down memory leaks, but it only keeps track of the objects that are more likely to cause memory leaks. However, there are other cases where the memory leaks could come from other (more or less obscure) objects. If this is your case, and you can’t find your leaks using trackref, you still have another resource: the muppy library.\n\nYou can use muppy from Pympler.\n\nIf you use pip, you can install muppy with the following command:\n\n```\npip install Pympler\n```\n\nHere’s an example to view all Python objects available in the heap using muppy:\n\n```\n>>> from pympler import muppy\n>>> all_objects = muppy.get_objects()\n>>> len(all_objects)\n28667\n>>> from pympler import summary\n>>> suml = summary.summarize(all_objects)\n>>> summary.print_(suml)\n                               types |   # objects |   total size\n==================================== | =========== | ==========\n                         <class 'str |        9822 |      1.10 MB\n                        <class 'dict |        1658 |    856.62 KB\n                        <class 'type |         436 |    443.60 KB\n                        <class 'code |        2974 |    419.56 KB\n          <class '_io.BufferedWriter |           2 |    256.34 KB\n                         <class 'set |         420 |    159.88 KB\n          <class '_io.BufferedReader |           1 |    128.17 KB\n          <class 'wrapper_descriptor |        1130 |     88.28 KB\n                       <class 'tuple |        1304 |     86.57 KB\n                     <class 'weakref |        1013 |     79.14 KB\n  <class 'builtin_function_or_method |         958 |     67.36 KB\n           <class 'method_descriptor |         865 |     60.82 KB\n                 <class 'abc.ABCMeta |          62 |     59.96 KB\n                        <class 'list |         446 |     58.52 KB\n                         <class 'int |        1425 |     43.20 KB\n```\n\nFor more info about muppy, refer to the muppy documentation..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/leaks.html", "title": "Debugging memory leaks", "description": "This page covers how to debug memory leaks in Scrapy, including common causes, tools like trackref and muppy, and best practices for managing memory usage.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 10, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 03:41:48", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "readthedocs-resolver-filename": "/topics/leaks.html", "readthedocs-http-status": "200", "language": "en", "readthedocs-project-slug": "scrapy", "readthedocs-version-slug": "latest", "title": "Debugging memory leaks — Scrapy 2.12.0 documentation", "generator": "Docutils 0.19: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/", "scrapeId": "87d5accd-983e-4609-8d88-2e5d7bc9e563", "sourceURL": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/leaks.html", "url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/leaks.html", "statusCode": 200}}}
{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: How do I leaks without leaks in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: To leaks without leaks in scrapy-latest, here's what you do:\nSometimes, you may notice that the memory usage of your Scrapy process will only increase, but never decrease. Unfortunately, this could happen even though neither Scrapy nor your project are leaking memory. This is due to a (not so well) known problem of Python, which may not return released memory to the operating system in some cases. For more information on this issue see:\n\n- Python Memory Management\n- Python Memory Management Part 2\n- Python Memory Management Part 3\n\nThe improvements proposed by Evan Jones, which are detailed in this paper, got merged in Python 2.5, but this only reduces the problem, it doesn’t fix it completely. To quote the paper:\n\n> _Unfortunately, this patch can only free an arena if there are no more_\n> _objects allocated in it anymore. This means that fragmentation is a large_\n> _issue. An application could have many megabytes of free memory, scattered_\n> _throughout all the arenas, but it will be unable to free any of it. This is_\n> _a problem experienced by all memory allocators. The only way to solve it is_\n> _to move to a compacting garbage collector, which is able to move objects in_\n> _memory. This would require significant changes to the Python interpreter._\n\nTo keep memory consumption reasonable you can split the job into several smaller jobs or enable persistent job queue and stop/start spider from time to time..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/leaks.html", "title": "Debugging memory leaks", "description": "This page covers how to debug memory leaks in Scrapy, including common causes, tools like trackref and muppy, and best practices for managing memory usage.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 10, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 03:41:48", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "readthedocs-resolver-filename": "/topics/leaks.html", "readthedocs-http-status": "200", "language": "en", "readthedocs-project-slug": "scrapy", "readthedocs-version-slug": "latest", "title": "Debugging memory leaks — Scrapy 2.12.0 documentation", "generator": "Docutils 0.19: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/", "scrapeId": "87d5accd-983e-4609-8d88-2e5d7bc9e563", "sourceURL": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/leaks.html", "url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/leaks.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Command line tool is in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Command line tool in scrapy-latest.\n\n# Command line tool\n\nScrapy is controlled through the `scrapy` command-line tool, to be referred to here as the “Scrapy tool” to differentiate it from the sub-commands, which we just call “commands” or “Scrapy commands”. The Scrapy tool provides several commands, for multiple purposes, and each one accepts a different set of arguments and options.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Configuration settings\n\nScrapy will look for configuration parameters in ini-style `scrapy.cfg` files in standard locations:\n\n1. `/etc/scrapy.cfg` or `c:\\scrapy\\scrapy.cfg` (system-wide),\n\n2. `~/.config/scrapy.cfg` ( `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`) and `~/.scrapy.cfg` ( `$HOME`)\nfor global (user-wide) settings, and\n\n3. `scrapy.cfg` inside a Scrapy project’s root (see next section).\n\nSettings from these files are merged in the listed order of preference:\nuser-defined values have higher priority than system-wide defaults\nand project-wide settings will override all others, when defined.\n\nScrapy also understands, and can be configured through, a number of environment variables. Currently these are:\n\n- `SCRAPY_SETTINGS_MODULE` (see [Designating the settings](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html#topics-settings-module-envvar))\n\n- `SCRAPY_PROJECT` (see [Sharing the root directory between projects](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/commands.html#topics-project-envvar))\n\n- `SCRAPY_PYTHON_SHELL` (see [Scrapy shell](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/shell.html#topics-shell))\n\n## Default structure of Scrapy projects\n\nBefore delving into the command-line tool and its sub-commands, let’s first understand the directory structure of a Scrapy project.\n\nThough it can be modified, all Scrapy projects have the same file structure by default, similar to this:\n\n```\nscrapy.cfg\nmyproject/\n    __init__.py\n    items.py\n    middlewares.py\n    pipelines.py\n    settings.py\n    spiders/\n        __init__.py\n        spider1.py\n        spider2.py\n        ...\n```\n\nThe directory where the `scrapy.cfg` file resides is known as the _project_\nroot directory_. That file contains the name of the python module that defines\nthe project settings. Here is an example:\n\n```\n[settings]\ndefault = myproject.settings\n```\n\n## Sharing the root directory between projects\n\nA project root directory, the one that contains the `scrapy.cfg`, may be\nshared by multiple Scrapy projects, each with its own settings module.\n\nIn that case, you must define one or more aliases for those settings modules\nunder `[settings]` in your `scrapy.cfg` file:\n\n```\n[settings]\ndefault = myproject1.settings\nproject1 = myproject1.settings\nproject2 = myproject2.settings\n```\n\nBy default, the `scrapy` command-line tool will use the `default` settings.\nUse the `SCRAPY_PROJECT` environment variable to specify a different project\nfor `scrapy` to use:\n\n```\n$ scrapy settings --get BOT_NAME\nProject 1 Bot\n$ export SCRAPY_PROJECT=project2\n$ scrapy settings --get BOT_NAME\nProject 2 Bot\n```\n\n## Using the `scrapy` tool\n\nYou can start by running the Scrapy tool with no arguments and it will print\nsome usage help and the available commands:\n\n```\nScrapy X.Y - no active project\n\nUsage:\n  scrapy <command> [options] [args]\n\nAvailable commands:\n  crawl         Run a spider\n  fetch         Fetch a URL using the Scrapy downloader\n[...] \n```\n\nThe first line will print the currently active project if you’re inside a\nScrapy project. In this example it was run from outside a project. If run from\ninside a project it would have printed something like this:\n\n```\nScrapy X.Y - project: myproject\n\nUsage:\n  scrapy <command> [options] [args]\n\n[...] \n```\n\n## Creating projects\n\nThe first thing you typically do with the `scrapy` tool is create your Scrapy\nproject:\n\n```\nscrapy startproject myproject [project_dir]\n```\n\nThat will create a Scrapy project under the `project_dir` directory.\nIf `project_dir` wasn’t specified, `project_dir` will be the same as `myproject`.\n\nNext, you go inside the new project directory:\n\n```\ncd project_dir\n```\n\nAnd you’re ready to use the `scrapy` command to manage and control your\nproject from there.\n\n## Controlling projects\n\nYou use the `scrapy` tool from inside your projects to control and manage\nthem.\n\nFor example, to create a new spider:\n\n```\nscrapy genspider mydomain mydomain.com\n```\n\nSome Scrapy commands (like [`crawl`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/commands.html#std-command-crawl)) must be run from inside a Scrapy\nproject. See the [commands reference](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/commands.html#topics-commands-ref) below for more\ninformation on which commands must be run from inside projects, and which not.\n\nAlso keep in mind that some commands may have slightly different behaviours\nwhen running them from inside projects. For example, the fetch command will use\nspider-overridden behaviours (such as the `user_agent` attribute to override\nthe user-agent) if the url being fetched is associated with some specific\nspider. This is intentional, as the `fetch` command is meant to be used to\ncheck how spiders are downloading pages.\n\n## Available tool commands\n\nThis section contains a list of the available built-in commands with a\ndescription and some usage examples. Remember, you can always get more info\nabout each command by running:\n\n```\nscrapy <command> -h\n```\n\nAnd you can see all available commands with:\n\n```\nscrapy -h\n```\n\nThere are two kinds of commands, those that only work from inside a Scrapy\nproject (Project-specific commands) and those that also work without an active\nScrapy project (Global commands), though they may behave slightly differently\nwhen run from inside a project (as they would use the project overridden\nsettings).\n\nGlobal commands:\n\n- [`startproject`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/commands.html#std-command-startproject)\n- [`genspider`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/commands.html#std-command-genspider)\n- [`settings`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/commands.html#std-command-settings)\n- [`runspider`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/commands.html#std-command-runspider)\n- [`shell`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/commands.html#std-command-shell)\n- [`fetch`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/commands.html#std-command-fetch)\n- [`view`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/commands.html#std-command-view)\n- [`version`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/commands.html#std-command-version)\n\nProject-only commands:\n\n- [`crawl`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/commands.html#std-command-crawl)\n- [`check`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/commands.html#std-command-check)\n- [`list`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/commands.html#std-command-list)\n- [`edit`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/commands.html#std-command-edit)\n- [`parse`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/commands.html#std-command-parse)\n- [`bench`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/commands.html#std-command-bench)\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/commands.html", "title": "Command line tool", "description": "Scrapy is controlled through the `scrapy` command-line tool, to be referred to here as the “Scrapy tool” to differentiate it from the sub-commands, which we just call “commands” or “Scrapy commands”.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Telnet Console is in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Telnet Console in scrapy-latest.\n\n# Telnet Console\n\nScrapy comes with a built-in telnet console for inspecting and controlling a Scrapy running process.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Introduction\n\nScrapy comes with a built-in telnet console for inspecting and controlling a Scrapy running process. The telnet console is just a regular python shell running inside the Scrapy process, so you can do literally anything from it.\n\nThe telnet console is a built-in Scrapy extension which comes enabled by default, but you can also disable it if you want. For more information about the extension itself see Telnet console extension.\n\n## Warning\n\nIt is not secure to use telnet console via public networks, as telnet doesn’t provide any transport-layer security. Having username/password authentication doesn’t change that.\n\nIntended usage is connecting to a running Scrapy spider locally (spider process and telnet client are on the same machine) or over a secure connection (VPN, SSH tunnel). Please avoid using telnet console over insecure connections, or disable it completely using TELNETCONSOLE_ENABLED option.\n\n## How to access the telnet console\n\nThe telnet console listens in the TCP port defined in the TELNETCONSOLE_PORT setting, which defaults to 6023. To access the console you need to type:\n\n```\ntelnet localhost 6023\nTrying localhost...\nConnected to localhost.\nEscape character is '^]'.\nUsername:\nPassword:\n>>>\n```\n\nBy default Username is `scrapy` and Password is autogenerated. The autogenerated Password can be seen on Scrapy logs like the example below:\n\n```\n2018-10-16 14:35:21 [scrapy.extensions.telnet] INFO: Telnet Password: 16f92501e8a59326\n```\n\nDefault Username and Password can be overridden by the settings TELNETCONSOLE_USERNAME and TELNETCONSOLE_PASSWORD.\n\n## Available variables in the telnet console\n\nThe telnet console is like a regular Python shell running inside the Scrapy process, so you can do anything from it including importing new modules, etc.\n\nHowever, the telnet console comes with some default variables defined for convenience:\n\n| Shortcut | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `crawler` | the Scrapy Crawler (scrapy.crawler.Crawler object) |\n| `engine` | Crawler.engine attribute |\n| `spider` | the active spider |\n| `slot` | the engine slot |\n| `extensions` | the Extension Manager (Crawler.extensions attribute) |\n| `stats` | the Stats Collector (Crawler.stats attribute) |\n| `settings` | the Scrapy settings object (Crawler.settings attribute) |\n| `est` | print a report of the engine status |\n| `prefs` | for memory debugging |\n| `p` | a shortcut to the pprint.pprint() function |\n| `hpy` | for memory debugging |\n\n## Telnet console usage examples\n\nHere are some example tasks you can do with the telnet console:\n\n### View engine status\nYou can use the `est()` method of the Scrapy engine to quickly show its state using the telnet console:\n\n```\ntelnet localhost 6023\n>>> est()\nExecution engine status\n\ntime()-engine.start_time                        : 8.62972998619\nlen(engine.downloader.active)                   : 16\nengine.scraper.is_idle()                        : False\nengine.spider.name                              : followall\nengine.spider_is_idle()                         : False\nengine.slot.closing                             : False\nlen(engine.slot.inprogress)                     : 16\nlen(engine.slot.scheduler.dqs or [])            : 0\nlen(engine.slot.scheduler.mqs)                  : 92\nlen(engine.scraper.slot.queue)                  : 0\nlen(engine.scraper.slot.active)                 : 0\nengine.scraper.slot.active_size                 : 0\nengine.scraper.slot.itemproc_size               : 0\nengine.scraper.slot.needs_backout()             : False\n```\n\n### Pause, resume and stop the Scrapy engine\nTo pause:\n\n```\ntelnet localhost 6023\n>>> engine.pause()\n>>>\n```\n\nTo resume:\n\n```\ntelnet localhost 6023\n>>> engine.unpause()\n>>>\n```\n\nTo stop:\n\n```\ntelnet localhost 6023\n>>> engine.stop()\nConnection closed by foreign host.\n```\n\n## Telnet Console signals\n\nscrapy.extensions.telnet.update_telnet_vars( _telnet_vars_)\n\nSent just before the telnet console is opened. You can hook up to this signal to add, remove or update the variables that will be available in the telnet local namespace. In order to do that, you need to update the `telnet_vars` dict in your handler.\n\nParameters:\n\n**telnet_vars** (dict) – the dict of telnet variables\n\n## Telnet settings\n\nThese are the settings that control the telnet console’s behaviour:\n\n### TELNETCONSOLE_PORT\nDefault: [6023, 6073]\n\nThe port range to use for the telnet console. If set to None, a dynamically assigned port is used.\n\n### TELNETCONSOLE_HOST\nDefault: '127.0.0.1'\n\nThe interface the telnet console should listen on\n\n### TELNETCONSOLE_USERNAME\nDefault: 'scrapy'\n\nThe username used for the telnet console\n\n### TELNETCONSOLE_PASSWORD\nDefault: None\n\nThe password used for the telnet console, default behaviour is to have it autogenerated.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/telnetconsole.html", "title": "Telnet Console", "description": "Scrapy comes with a built-in telnet console for inspecting and controlling a Scrapy running process.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 7, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 03:43:05", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"readthedocs-version-slug": "latest", "language": "en", "title": "Telnet Console — Scrapy 2.12.0 documentation", "readthedocs-resolver-filename": "/topics/telnetconsole.html", "readthedocs-http-status": "200", "generator": "Docutils 0.19: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/", "readthedocs-project-slug": "scrapy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "scrapeId": "02b426b2-2903-46b6-b44e-e7234e86f3fd", "sourceURL": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/telnetconsole.html", "url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/telnetconsole.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Spiders is in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Spiders in scrapy-latest.\n\n# Spiders\n\nSpiders are classes which define how a certain site (or a group of sites) will be scraped, including how to perform the crawl (i.e. follow links) and how to extract structured data from their pages (i.e. scraping items).Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Overview\n\nSpiders are classes which define how a certain site (or a group of sites) will be scraped, including how to perform the crawl (i.e. follow links) and how to extract structured data from their pages (i.e. scraping items). In other words, Spiders are the place where you define the custom behaviour for crawling and parsing pages for a particular site (or, in some cases, a group of sites).\n\n## Scraping Cycle\n\nFor spiders, the scraping cycle goes through something like this:\n\n1. You start by generating the initial Requests to crawl the first URLs, and specify a callback function to be called with the response downloaded from those requests.\n\nThe first requests to perform are obtained by calling the `start_requests()` method which (by default) generates `Request` for the URLs specified in the `start_urls` and the `parse` method as callback function for the Requests.\n\n2. In the callback function, you parse the response (web page) and return item objects, `Request` objects, or an iterable of these objects. Those Requests will also contain a callback (maybe the same) and will then be downloaded by Scrapy and then their response handled by the specified callback.\n\n3. In callback functions, you parse the page contents, typically using Selectors (but you can also use BeautifulSoup, lxml or whatever mechanism you prefer) and generate items with the parsed data.\n\n4. Finally, the items returned from the spider will be typically persisted to a database (in some Item Pipeline) or written to a file using Feed exports.\n\n## scrapy.Spider\n\nThis is the simplest spider, and the one from which every other spider must inherit (including spiders that come bundled with Scrapy, as well as spiders that you write yourself). It doesn’t provide any special functionality. It just provides a default `start_requests()` implementation which sends requests from the `start_urls` spider attribute and calls the spider’s method `parse` for each of the resulting responses.\n\n## Attributes\n\n- **name**: A string which defines the name for this spider. The spider name is how the spider is located (and instantiated) by Scrapy, so it must be unique.\n- **allowed_domains**: An optional list of strings containing domains that this spider is allowed to crawl.\n- **start_urls**: A list of URLs where the spider will begin to crawl from.\n- **custom_settings**: A dictionary of settings that will be overridden from the project wide configuration when running this spider.\n- **crawler**: This attribute is set by the `from_crawler()` class method after initializing the class, and links to the `Crawler` object to which this spider instance is bound.\n- **settings**: Configuration for running this spider.\n- **logger**: Python logger created with the Spider’s name.\n- **state**: A dict you can use to persist some spider state between batches.\n\n## Methods\n\n- **from_crawler(crawler, *args, **kwargs)**: This is the class method used by Scrapy to create your spiders.\n- **update_settings(settings)**: The `update_settings()` method is used to modify the spider’s settings and is called during initialization of a spider instance.\n- **start_requests()**: This method must return an iterable with the first Requests to crawl and/or with item objects for this spider.\n- **parse(response)**: This is the default callback used by Scrapy to process downloaded responses.\n- **log(message[, level, component])**: Wrapper that sends a log message through the Spider’s logger.\n- **closed(reason)**: Called when the spider closes.\n\n## Spider Arguments\n\nSpiders can receive arguments that modify their behaviour. Some common uses for spider arguments are to define the start URLs or to restrict the crawl to certain sections of the site.\n\n## Generic Spiders\n\nScrapy comes with some useful generic spiders that you can use to subclass your spiders from. Their aim is to provide convenient functionality for a few common scraping cases.\n\n## CrawlSpider\n\nThis is the most commonly used spider for crawling regular websites, as it provides a convenient mechanism for following links by defining a set of rules.\n\n## XMLFeedSpider\n\nXMLFeedSpider is designed for parsing XML feeds by iterating through them by a certain node name.\n\n## CSVFeedSpider\n\nThis spider is very similar to the XMLFeedSpider, except that it iterates over rows, instead of nodes.\n\n## SitemapSpider\n\nSitemapSpider allows you to crawl a site by discovering the URLs using Sitemaps.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spiders.html", "title": "Spiders", "description": "Spiders are classes which define how a certain site (or a group of sites) will be scraped, including how to perform the crawl (i.e. follow links) and how to extract structured data from their pages (i.e. scraping items).", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 11, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 03:43:45", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"title": "Spiders — Scrapy 2.12.0 documentation", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "readthedocs-project-slug": "scrapy", "readthedocs-http-status": "200", "language": "en", "readthedocs-resolver-filename": "/topics/spiders.html", "generator": "Docutils 0.19: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/", "readthedocs-version-slug": "latest", "scrapeId": "008e7a86-4d6c-4ed3-b2cb-201610405aa1", "sourceURL": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spiders.html", "url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spiders.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: How do I scraping cycle in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: To scraping cycle in scrapy-latest, here's what you do:\nFor spiders, the scraping cycle goes through something like this:\n\n1. You start by generating the initial Requests to crawl the first URLs, and specify a callback function to be called with the response downloaded from those requests.\n\nThe first requests to perform are obtained by calling the `start_requests()` method which (by default) generates `Request` for the URLs specified in the `start_urls` and the `parse` method as callback function for the Requests.\n\n2. In the callback function, you parse the response (web page) and return item objects, `Request` objects, or an iterable of these objects. Those Requests will also contain a callback (maybe the same) and will then be downloaded by Scrapy and then their response handled by the specified callback.\n\n3. In callback functions, you parse the page contents, typically using Selectors (but you can also use BeautifulSoup, lxml or whatever mechanism you prefer) and generate items with the parsed data.\n\n4. Finally, the items returned from the spider will be typically persisted to a database (in some Item Pipeline) or written to a file using Feed exports..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spiders.html", "title": "Spiders", "description": "Spiders are classes which define how a certain site (or a group of sites) will be scraped, including how to perform the crawl (i.e. follow links) and how to extract structured data from their pages (i.e. scraping items).", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 11, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 03:43:45", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"title": "Spiders — Scrapy 2.12.0 documentation", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "readthedocs-project-slug": "scrapy", "readthedocs-http-status": "200", "language": "en", "readthedocs-resolver-filename": "/topics/spiders.html", "generator": "Docutils 0.19: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/", "readthedocs-version-slug": "latest", "scrapeId": "008e7a86-4d6c-4ed3-b2cb-201610405aa1", "sourceURL": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spiders.html", "url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spiders.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Common Practices is in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Common Practices in scrapy-latest.\n\n# Common Practices\n\nThis section documents common practices when using Scrapy. These are things that cover many topics and don’t often fall into any other specific section.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Run Scrapy from a script\n\nYou can use the API to run Scrapy from a script, instead of the typical way of running Scrapy via `scrapy crawl`.\n\nRemember that Scrapy is built on top of the Twisted asynchronous networking library, so you need to run it inside the Twisted reactor.\n\nThe first utility you can use to run your spiders is `scrapy.crawler.CrawlerProcess`. This class will start a Twisted reactor for you, configuring the logging and setting shutdown handlers. This class is the one used by all Scrapy commands.\n\nHere’s an example showing how to run a single spider with it.\n\n```\nimport scrapy\nfrom scrapy.crawler import CrawlerProcess\n\nclass MySpider(scrapy.Spider):\n    # Your spider definition\n    ...\n\nprocess = CrawlerProcess(\n    settings={\n        \"FEEDS\": {\n            \"items.json\": {\"format\": \"json\"},\n        },\n    }\n)\n\nprocess.crawl(MySpider)\nprocess.start()  # the script will block here until the crawling is finished\n```\n\nDefine settings within dictionary in CrawlerProcess. Make sure to check `CrawlerProcess` documentation to get acquainted with its usage details.\n\nIf you are inside a Scrapy project there are some additional helpers you can use to import those components within the project. You can automatically import your spiders passing their name to `CrawlerProcess`, and use `get_project_settings` to get a `Settings` instance with your project settings.\n\nWhat follows is a working example of how to do that, using the testspiders project as example.\n\n```\nfrom scrapy.crawler import CrawlerProcess\nfrom scrapy.utils.project import get_project_settings\n\nprocess = CrawlerProcess(get_project_settings())\n\n# 'followall' is the name of one of the spiders of the project.\nprocess.crawl(\"followall\", domain=\"scrapy.org\")\nprocess.start()  # the script will block here until the crawling is finished\n```\n\nThere’s another Scrapy utility that provides more control over the crawling process: `scrapy.crawler.CrawlerRunner`. This class is a thin wrapper that encapsulates some simple helpers to run multiple crawlers, but it won’t start or interfere with existing reactors in any way.\n\nUsing this class the reactor should be explicitly run after scheduling your spiders. It’s recommended you use `CrawlerRunner` instead of `CrawlerProcess` if your application is already using Twisted and you want to run Scrapy in the same reactor.\n\nNote that you will also have to shutdown the Twisted reactor yourself after the spider is finished. This can be achieved by adding callbacks to the deferred returned by the `CrawlerRunner.crawl` method.\n\nHere’s an example of its usage, along with a callback to manually stop the reactor after `MySpider` has finished running.\n\n```\nimport scrapy\nfrom scrapy.crawler import CrawlerRunner\nfrom scrapy.utils.log import configure_logging\n\nclass MySpider(scrapy.Spider):\n    # Your spider definition\n    ...\n\nconfigure_logging({\"LOG_FORMAT\": \"%(levelname)s: %(message)s\"})\nrunning = CrawlerRunner()\n\nd = running.crawl(MySpider)\n\nfrom twisted.internet import reactor\n\nd.addBoth(lambda _: reactor.stop())\nreactor.run()  # the script will block here until the crawling is finished\n```\n\nSame example but using a non-default reactor, it’s only necessary call `install_reactor` if you are using `CrawlerRunner` since `CrawlerProcess` already does this automatically.\n\n```\nimport scrapy\nfrom scrapy.crawler import CrawlerRunner\nfrom scrapy.utils.log import configure_logging\n\nclass MySpider(scrapy.Spider):\n    # Your spider definition\n    ...\n\nconfigure_logging({\"LOG_FORMAT\": \"%(levelname)s: %(message)s\"})\n\nfrom scrapy.utils.reactor import install_reactor\n\ninstall_reactor(\"twisted.internet.asyncioreactor.AsyncioSelectorReactor\")\nrunning = CrawlerRunner()\nd = running.crawl(MySpider)\n\nfrom twisted.internet import reactor\n\nd.addBoth(lambda _: reactor.stop())\nreactor.run()  # the script will block here until the crawling is finished\n```\n\nSee also\n\n[Reactor Overview](https://docs.twisted.org/en/stable/core/howto/reactor-basics.html)\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/practices.html", "title": "Common Practices", "description": "This section documents common practices when using Scrapy.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what AutoThrottle extension is in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain AutoThrottle extension in scrapy-latest.\n\n# AutoThrottle extension\n\nThis is an extension for automatically throttling crawling speed based on load of both the Scrapy server and the website you are crawling.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Design goals\n\n1. be nicer to sites instead of using default download delay of zero\n\n2. automatically adjust Scrapy to the optimum crawling speed, so the user doesn’t have to tune the download delays to find the optimum one. The user only needs to specify the maximum concurrent requests it allows, and the extension does the rest.\n\n## How it works\n\nScrapy allows defining the concurrency and delay of different download slots, e.g. through the [`DOWNLOAD_SLOTS`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html#std-setting-DOWNLOAD_SLOTS) setting. By default requests are assigned to slots based on their URL domain, although it is possible to customize the download slot of any request.\n\nThe AutoThrottle extension adjusts the delay of each download slot dynamically, to make your spider send [`AUTOTHROTTLE_TARGET_CONCURRENCY`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/autothrottle.html#std-setting-AUTOTHROTTLE_TARGET_CONCURRENCY) concurrent requests on average to each remote website.\n\nIt uses download latency to compute the delays. The main idea is the following: if a server needs `latency` seconds to respond, a client should send a request each `latency/N` seconds to have `N` requests processed in parallel.\n\nInstead of adjusting the delays one can just set a small fixed download delay and impose hard limits on concurrency using [`CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_DOMAIN`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html#std-setting-CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_DOMAIN) or [`CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_IP`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html#std-setting-CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_IP) options. It will provide a similar effect, but there are some important differences:\n\n- because the download delay is small there will be occasional bursts of requests;\n\n- often non-200 (error) responses can be returned faster than regular responses, so with a small download delay and a hard concurrency limit crawler will be sending requests to server faster when server starts to return errors. But this is an opposite of what crawler should do - in case of errors it makes more sense to slow down: these errors may be caused by the high request rate.\n\nAutoThrottle doesn’t have these issues.\n\n## Throttling algorithm\n\nAutoThrottle algorithm adjusts download delays based on the following rules:\n\n1. spiders always start with a download delay of [`AUTOTHROTTLE_START_DELAY`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/autothrottle.html#std-setting-AUTOTHROTTLE_START_DELAY);\n\n2. when a response is received, the target download delay is calculated as `latency / N` where `latency` is a latency of the response, and `N` is [`AUTOTHROTTLE_TARGET_CONCURRENCY`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/autothrottle.html#std-setting-AUTOTHROTTLE_TARGET_CONCURRENCY).\n\n3. download delay for next requests is set to the average of previous download delay and the target download delay;\n\n4. latencies of non-200 responses are not allowed to decrease the delay;\n\n5. download delay can’t become less than [`DOWNLOAD_DELAY`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html#std-setting-DOWNLOAD_DELAY) or greater than [`AUTOTHROTTLE_MAX_DELAY`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/autothrottle.html#std-setting-AUTOTHROTTLE_MAX_DELAY)\n\nNote\n\nThe AutoThrottle extension honours the standard Scrapy settings for concurrency and delay. This means that it will respect [`CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_DOMAIN`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html#std-setting-CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_DOMAIN) and [`CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_IP`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html#std-setting-CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_IP) options and never set a download delay lower than [`DOWNLOAD_DELAY`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html#std-setting-DOWNLOAD_DELAY).\n\nIn Scrapy, the download latency is measured as the time elapsed between establishing the TCP connection and receiving the HTTP headers.\n\nNote that these latencies are very hard to measure accurately in a cooperative multitasking environment because Scrapy may be busy processing a spider callback, for example, and unable to attend downloads. However, these latencies should still give a reasonable estimate of how busy Scrapy (and ultimately, the server) is, and this extension builds on that premise.\n\n## Prevent specific requests from triggering slot delay adjustments\n\nAutoThrottle adjusts the delay of download slots based on the latencies of responses that belong to that download slot. The only exceptions are non-200 responses, which are only taken into account to increase that delay, but ignored if they would decrease that delay.\n\nYou can also set the `autothrottle_dont_adjust_delay` request metadata key to `True` in any request to prevent its response latency from impacting the delay of its download slot:\n\n```\nfrom scrapy import Request\n\nRequest(\"https://example.com\", meta={\"autothrottle_dont_adjust_delay\": True})\n```\n\nNote, however, that AutoThrottle still determines the starting delay of every download slot by setting the `download_delay` attribute on the running spider. If you want AutoThrottle not to impact a download slot at all, in addition to setting this meta key in all requests that use that download slot, you might want to set a custom value for the `delay` attribute of that download slot, e.g. using [`DOWNLOAD_SLOTS`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html#std-setting-DOWNLOAD_SLOTS).\n\n## Settings\n\nThe settings used to control the AutoThrottle extension are:\n\n- [`AUTOTHROTTLE_ENABLED`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/autothrottle.html#std-setting-AUTOTHROTTLE_ENABLED)\n\n- [`AUTOTHROTTLE_START_DELAY`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/autothrottle.html#std-setting-AUTOTHROTTLE_START_DELAY)\n\n- [`AUTOTHROTTLE_MAX_DELAY`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/autothrottle.html#std-setting-AUTOTHROTTLE_MAX_DELAY)\n\n- [`AUTOTHROTTLE_TARGET_CONCURRENCY`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/autothrottle.html#std-setting-AUTOTHROTTLE_TARGET_CONCURRENCY)\n\n- [`AUTOTHROTTLE_DEBUG`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/autothrottle.html#std-setting-AUTOTHROTTLE_DEBUG)\n\n- [`CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_DOMAIN`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html#std-setting-CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_DOMAIN)\n\n- [`CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_IP`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html#std-setting-CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_IP)\n\n- [`DOWNLOAD_DELAY`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html#std-setting-DOWNLOAD_DELAY)\n\nFor more information see [How it works](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/autothrottle.html#autothrottle-algorithm).\n\n## AUTOTHROTTLE_ENABLED\n\nDefault: `False`\n\nEnables the AutoThrottle extension.\n\n## AUTOTHROTTLE_START_DELAY\n\nDefault: `5.0`\n\nThe initial download delay (in seconds).\n\n## AUTOTHROTTLE_MAX_DELAY\n\nDefault: `60.0`\n\nThe maximum download delay (in seconds) to be set in case of high latencies.\n\n## AUTOTHROTTLE_TARGET_CONCURRENCY\n\nDefault: `1.0`\n\nAverage number of requests Scrapy should be sending in parallel to remote websites. It must be higher than `0.0`.\n\nBy default, AutoThrottle adjusts the delay to send a single concurrent request to each of the remote websites.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: How do I how it works in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: To how it works in scrapy-latest, here's what you do:\nScrapy allows defining the concurrency and delay of different download slots, e.g. through the [`DOWNLOAD_SLOTS`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html#std-setting-DOWNLOAD_SLOTS) setting. By default requests are assigned to slots based on their URL domain, although it is possible to customize the download slot of any request.\n\nThe AutoThrottle extension adjusts the delay of each download slot dynamically, to make your spider send [`AUTOTHROTTLE_TARGET_CONCURRENCY`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/autothrottle.html#std-setting-AUTOTHROTTLE_TARGET_CONCURRENCY) concurrent requests on average to each remote website.\n\nIt uses download latency to compute the delays. The main idea is the following: if a server needs `latency` seconds to respond, a client should send a request each `latency/N` seconds to have `N` requests processed in parallel.\n\nInstead of adjusting the delays one can just set a small fixed download delay and impose hard limits on concurrency using [`CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_DOMAIN`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html#std-setting-CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_DOMAIN) or [`CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_IP`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html#std-setting-CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_IP) options. It will provide a similar effect, but there are some important differences:\n\n- because the download delay is small there will be occasional bursts of requests;\n\n- often non-200 (error) responses can be returned faster than regular responses, so with a small download delay and a hard concurrency limit crawler will be sending requests to server faster when server starts to return errors. But this is an opposite of what crawler should do - in case of errors it makes more sense to slow down: these errors may be caused by the high request rate.\n\nAutoThrottle doesn’t have these issues..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/autothrottle.html", "title": "AutoThrottle extension", "description": "This is an extension for automatically throttling crawling speed based on load of both the Scrapy server and the website you are crawling.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 10, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 03:48:16", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"language": "en", "generator": "Docutils 0.19: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/", "readthedocs-http-status": "200", "readthedocs-project-slug": "scrapy", "title": "AutoThrottle extension — Scrapy 2.12.0 documentation", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "readthedocs-resolver-filename": "/topics/autothrottle.html", "readthedocs-version-slug": "latest", "scrapeId": "e45bd8f7-38c6-4290-856f-53e1a7a0d2b3", "sourceURL": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/autothrottle.html", "url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/autothrottle.html", "statusCode": 200}}}
{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: How do I throttling algorithm in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: To throttling algorithm in scrapy-latest, here's what you do:\nAutoThrottle algorithm adjusts download delays based on the following rules:\n\n1. spiders always start with a download delay of [`AUTOTHROTTLE_START_DELAY`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/autothrottle.html#std-setting-AUTOTHROTTLE_START_DELAY);\n\n2. when a response is received, the target download delay is calculated as `latency / N` where `latency` is a latency of the response, and `N` is [`AUTOTHROTTLE_TARGET_CONCURRENCY`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/autothrottle.html#std-setting-AUTOTHROTTLE_TARGET_CONCURRENCY).\n\n3. download delay for next requests is set to the average of previous download delay and the target download delay;\n\n4. latencies of non-200 responses are not allowed to decrease the delay;\n\n5. download delay can’t become less than [`DOWNLOAD_DELAY`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html#std-setting-DOWNLOAD_DELAY) or greater than [`AUTOTHROTTLE_MAX_DELAY`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/autothrottle.html#std-setting-AUTOTHROTTLE_MAX_DELAY)\n\nNote\n\nThe AutoThrottle extension honours the standard Scrapy settings for concurrency and delay. This means that it will respect [`CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_DOMAIN`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html#std-setting-CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_DOMAIN) and [`CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_IP`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html#std-setting-CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_IP) options and never set a download delay lower than [`DOWNLOAD_DELAY`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html#std-setting-DOWNLOAD_DELAY).\n\nIn Scrapy, the download latency is measured as the time elapsed between establishing the TCP connection and receiving the HTTP headers.\n\nNote that these latencies are very hard to measure accurately in a cooperative multitasking environment because Scrapy may be busy processing a spider callback, for example, and unable to attend downloads. However, these latencies should still give a reasonable estimate of how busy Scrapy (and ultimately, the server) is, and this extension builds on that premise..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/autothrottle.html", "title": "AutoThrottle extension", "description": "This is an extension for automatically throttling crawling speed based on load of both the Scrapy server and the website you are crawling.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 10, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 03:48:16", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"language": "en", "generator": "Docutils 0.19: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/", "readthedocs-http-status": "200", "readthedocs-project-slug": "scrapy", "title": "AutoThrottle extension — Scrapy 2.12.0 documentation", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "readthedocs-resolver-filename": "/topics/autothrottle.html", "readthedocs-version-slug": "latest", "scrapeId": "e45bd8f7-38c6-4290-856f-53e1a7a0d2b3", "sourceURL": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/autothrottle.html", "url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/autothrottle.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Spider Middleware is in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Spider Middleware in scrapy-latest.\n\n# Spider Middleware\n\nThe spider middleware is a framework of hooks into Scrapy’s spider processing mechanism where you can plug custom functionality to process the responses that are sent to Spiders for processing and to process the requests and items that are generated from spiders.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Activating a spider middleware\n\nTo activate a spider middleware component, add it to the `SPIDER_MIDDLEWARES` setting, which is a dict whose keys are the middleware class path and their values are the middleware orders.\n\nHere’s an example:\n\n```\nSPIDER_MIDDLEWARES = {\n    \"myproject.middlewares.CustomSpiderMiddleware\": 543,\n}\n```\n\nThe `SPIDER_MIDDLEWARES` setting is merged with the `SPIDER_MIDDLEWARES_BASE` setting defined in Scrapy (and not meant to be overridden) and then sorted by order to get the final sorted list of enabled middlewares: the first middleware is the one closer to the engine and the last is the one closer to the spider. In other words, the `process_spider_input()` method of each middleware will be invoked in increasing middleware order (100, 200, 300, …), and the `process_spider_output()` method of each middleware will be invoked in decreasing order.\n\nTo decide which order to assign to your middleware see the `SPIDER_MIDDLEWARES_BASE` setting and pick a value according to where you want to insert the middleware. The order does matter because each middleware performs a different action and your middleware could depend on some previous (or subsequent) middleware being applied.\n\nIf you want to disable a builtin middleware (the ones defined in `SPIDER_MIDDLEWARES_BASE`, and enabled by default) you must define it in your project `SPIDER_MIDDLEWARES` setting and assign `None` as its value. For example, if you want to disable the off-site middleware:\n\n```\nSPIDER_MIDDLEWARES = {\n    \"scrapy.spidermiddlewares.referer.RefererMiddleware\": None,\n    \"myproject.middlewares.CustomRefererSpiderMiddleware\": 700,\n}\n```\n\nFinally, keep in mind that some middlewares may need to be enabled through a particular setting. See each middleware documentation for more info.\n\n## Writing your own spider middleware\n\nEach spider middleware is a Python class that defines one or more of the methods defined below.\n\nThe main entry point is the `from_crawler` class method, which receives a `Crawler` instance. The `Crawler` object gives you access, for example, to the settings.\n\n_class_ scrapy.spidermiddlewares.SpiderMiddleware\n\nprocess_spider_input( _response_, _spider_)\n\nThis method is called for each response that goes through the spider middleware and into the spider, for processing.\n\n`process_spider_input()` should return `None` or raise an exception.\n\nIf it returns `None`, Scrapy will continue processing this response, executing all other middlewares until, finally, the response is handed to the spider for processing.\n\nIf it raises an exception, Scrapy won’t bother calling any other spider middleware `process_spider_input()` and will call the request errback if there is one, otherwise it will start the `process_spider_exception()` chain. The output of the errback is chained back in the other direction for `process_spider_output()` to process it, or `process_spider_exception()` if it raised an exception.\n\nParameters:\n- **response** ( `Response` object) – the response being processed\n- **spider** ( `Spider` object) – the spider for which this response is intended\n\nprocess_spider_output( _response_, _result_, _spider_)\n\nThis method is called with the results returned from the Spider, after it has processed the response.\n\n`process_spider_output()` must return an iterable of `Request` objects and item objects.\n\nChanged in version 2.7: This method may be defined as an asynchronous generator, in which case `result` is an asynchronous iterable.\n\nConsider defining this method as an asynchronous generator, which will be a requirement in a future version of Scrapy. However, if you plan on sharing your spider middleware with other people, consider either enforcing Scrapy 2.7 as a minimum requirement of your spider middleware, or making your spider middleware universal so that it works with Scrapy versions earlier than Scrapy 2.7.\n\nParameters:\n- **response** ( `Response` object) – the response which generated this output from the spider\n- **result** (an iterable of `Request` objects and item objects) – the result returned by the spider\n- **spider** ( `Spider` object) – the spider whose result is being processed\n\nprocess_spider_output_async( _response_, _result_, _spider_)\n\nNew in version 2.7.\n\nIf defined, this method must be an asynchronous generator, which will be called instead of `process_spider_output()` if `result` is an asynchronous iterable.\n\nprocess_spider_exception( _response_, _exception_, _spider_)\n\nThis method is called when a spider or `process_spider_output()` method (from a previous spider middleware) raises an exception.\n\n`process_spider_exception()` should return either `None` or an iterable of `Request` or item objects.\n\nIf it returns `None`, Scrapy will continue processing this exception, executing any other `process_spider_exception()` in the following middleware components, until no middleware components are left and the exception reaches the engine (where it’s logged and discarded).\n\nIf it returns an iterable the `process_spider_output()` pipeline kicks in, starting from the next spider middleware, and no other `process_spider_exception()` will be called.\n\nParameters:\n- **response** ( `Response` object) – the response being processed when the exception was raised\n- **exception** ( `Exception` object) – the exception raised\n- **spider** ( `Spider` object) – the spider which raised the exception\n\nprocess_start_requests( _start_requests_, _spider_)\n\nThis method is called with the start requests of the spider, and works similarly to the `process_spider_output()` method, except that it doesn’t have a response associated and must return only requests (not items).\n\nIt receives an iterable (in the `start_requests` parameter) and must return another iterable of `Request` objects and/or item objects.\n\nNote\nWhen implementing this method in your spider middleware, you should always return an iterable (that follows the input one) and not consume all `start_requests` iterator because it can be very large (or even unbounded) and cause a memory overflow. The Scrapy engine is designed to pull start requests while it has capacity to process them, so the start requests iterator can be effectively endless where there is some other condition for stopping the spider (like a time limit or item/page count).\n\nParameters:\n- **start_requests** (an iterable of `Request`) – the start requests\n- **spider** ( `Spider` object) – the spider to whom the start requests belong\n\nfrom_crawler( _cls_, _crawler_)\n\nIf present, this classmethod is called to create a middleware instance from a `Crawler`. It must return a new instance of the middleware. Crawler object provides access to all Scrapy core components like settings and signals; it is a way for middleware to access them and hook its functionality into Scrapy.\n\nParameters:\n**crawler** ( `Crawler` object) – crawler that uses this middleware.\n\n## Built-in spider middleware reference\n\nThis page describes all spider middleware components that come with Scrapy. For information on how to use them and how to write your own spider middleware, see the spider middleware usage guide.\n\nFor a list of the components enabled by default (and their orders) see the `SPIDER_MIDDLEWARES_BASE` setting.\n\n## DepthMiddleware\n\n_class_ scrapy.spidermiddlewares.depth.DepthMiddleware\n\nDepthMiddleware is used for tracking the depth of each Request inside the site being scraped. It works by setting `request.meta['depth'] = 0` whenever there is no value previously set (usually just the first Request) and incrementing it by 1 otherwise.\n\nIt can be used to limit the maximum depth to scrape, control Request priority based on their depth, and things like that.\n\nThe `DepthMiddleware` can be configured through the following settings:\n- `DEPTH_LIMIT` - The maximum depth that will be allowed to crawl for any site. If zero, no limit will be imposed.\n- `DEPTH_STATS_VERBOSE` - Whether to collect the number of requests for each depth.\n- `DEPTH_PRIORITY` - Whether to prioritize the requests based on their depth.\n\n## HttpErrorMiddleware\n\n_class_ scrapy.spidermiddlewares.httperror.HttpErrorMiddleware\n\nFilter out unsuccessful (erroneous) HTTP responses so that spiders don’t have to deal with them, which (most of the time) imposes an overhead, consumes more resources, and makes the spider logic more complex.\n\nAccording to the HTTP standard, successful responses are those whose status codes are in the 200-300 range.\n\nIf you still want to process response codes outside that range, you can specify which response codes the spider is able to handle using the `handle_httpstatus_list` spider attribute or `HTTPERROR_ALLOWED_CODES` setting.\n\nFor example, if you want your spider to handle 404 responses you can do this:\n\n```\nfrom scrapy.spiders import CrawlSpider\n\nclass MySpider(CrawlSpider):\n    handle_httpstatus_list = [404]\n```\n\nThe `handle_httpstatus_list` key of `Request.meta` can also be used to specify which response codes to allow on a per-request basis. You can also set the meta key `handle_httpstatus_all` to `True` if you want to allow any response code for a request, and `False` to disable the effects of the `handle_httpstatus_all` key.\n\nKeep in mind, however, that it’s usually a bad idea to handle non-200 responses, unless you really know what you’re doing.\n\n## RefererMiddleware\n\n_class_ scrapy.spidermiddlewares.referer.RefererMiddleware\n\nPopulates Request `Referer` header, based on the URL of the Response which generated it.\n\n## UrlLengthMiddleware\n\n_class_ scrapy.spidermiddlewares.urllength.UrlLengthMiddleware\n\nFilters out requests with URLs longer than URLLENGTH_LIMIT.\n\nThe `UrlLengthMiddleware` can be configured through the following settings:\n- `URLLENGTH_LIMIT` - The maximum URL length to allow for crawled URLs.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spider-middleware.html", "title": "Spider Middleware", "description": "The spider middleware is a framework of hooks into Scrapy’s spider processing mechanism where you can plug custom functionality to process the responses that are sent to Spiders for processing and to process the requests and items that are generated from spiders.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 7, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 03:56:43", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"readthedocs-resolver-filename": "/topics/spider-middleware.html", "language": "en", "readthedocs-version-slug": "latest", "generator": "Docutils 0.19: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "readthedocs-http-status": "200", "title": "Spider Middleware — Scrapy 2.12.0 documentation", "readthedocs-project-slug": "scrapy", "scrapeId": "4d2287df-d3f2-418f-824f-96df229acc78", "sourceURL": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spider-middleware.html", "url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spider-middleware.html", "statusCode": 200}}}
{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: How do I activating a spider middleware in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: To activating a spider middleware in scrapy-latest, here's what you do:\nTo activate a spider middleware component, add it to the `SPIDER_MIDDLEWARES` setting, which is a dict whose keys are the middleware class path and their values are the middleware orders.\n\nHere’s an example:\n\n```\nSPIDER_MIDDLEWARES = {\n    \"myproject.middlewares.CustomSpiderMiddleware\": 543,\n}\n```\n\nThe `SPIDER_MIDDLEWARES` setting is merged with the `SPIDER_MIDDLEWARES_BASE` setting defined in Scrapy (and not meant to be overridden) and then sorted by order to get the final sorted list of enabled middlewares: the first middleware is the one closer to the engine and the last is the one closer to the spider. In other words, the `process_spider_input()` method of each middleware will be invoked in increasing middleware order (100, 200, 300, …), and the `process_spider_output()` method of each middleware will be invoked in decreasing order.\n\nTo decide which order to assign to your middleware see the `SPIDER_MIDDLEWARES_BASE` setting and pick a value according to where you want to insert the middleware. The order does matter because each middleware performs a different action and your middleware could depend on some previous (or subsequent) middleware being applied.\n\nIf you want to disable a builtin middleware (the ones defined in `SPIDER_MIDDLEWARES_BASE`, and enabled by default) you must define it in your project `SPIDER_MIDDLEWARES` setting and assign `None` as its value. For example, if you want to disable the off-site middleware:\n\n```\nSPIDER_MIDDLEWARES = {\n    \"scrapy.spidermiddlewares.referer.RefererMiddleware\": None,\n    \"myproject.middlewares.CustomRefererSpiderMiddleware\": 700,\n}\n```\n\nFinally, keep in mind that some middlewares may need to be enabled through a particular setting.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: How do I writing your own spider middleware in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: To writing your own spider middleware in scrapy-latest, here's what you do:\nEach spider middleware is a Python class that defines one or more of the methods defined below.\n\nThe main entry point is the `from_crawler` class method, which receives a `Crawler` instance. The `Crawler` object gives you access, for example, to the settings.\n\n_class_ scrapy.spidermiddlewares.SpiderMiddleware\n\nprocess_spider_input( _response_, _spider_)\n\nThis method is called for each response that goes through the spider middleware and into the spider, for processing.\n\n`process_spider_input()` should return `None` or raise an exception.\n\nIf it returns `None`, Scrapy will continue processing this response, executing all other middlewares until, finally, the response is handed to the spider for processing.\n\nIf it raises an exception, Scrapy won’t bother calling any other spider middleware `process_spider_input()` and will call the request errback if there is one, otherwise it will start the `process_spider_exception()` chain. The output of the errback is chained back in the other direction for `process_spider_output()` to process it, or `process_spider_exception()` if it raised an exception.\n\nParameters:\n- **response** ( `Response` object) – the response being processed\n- **spider** ( `Spider` object) – the spider for which this response is intended\n\nprocess_spider_output( _response_, _result_, _spider_)\n\nThis method is called with the results returned from the Spider, after it has processed the response.\n\n`process_spider_output()` must return an iterable of `Request` objects and item objects.\n\nChanged in version 2.7: This method may be defined as an asynchronous generator, in which case `result` is an asynchronous iterable.\n\nConsider defining this method as an asynchronous generator, which will be a requirement in a future version of Scrapy. However, if you plan on sharing your spider middleware with other people, consider either enforcing Scrapy 2.7 as a minimum requirement of your spider middleware, or making your spider middleware universal so that it works with Scrapy versions earlier than Scrapy 2.7.\n\nParameters:\n- **response** ( `Response` object) – the response which generated this output from the spider\n- **result** (an iterable of `Request` objects and item objects) – the result returned by the spider\n- **spider** ( `Spider` object) – the spider whose result is being processed\n\nprocess_spider_output_async( _response_, _result_, _spider_)\n\nNew in version 2.7.\n\nIf defined, this method must be an asynchronous generator, which will be called instead of `process_spider_output()` if `result` is an asynchronous iterable.\n\nprocess_spider_exception( _response_, _exception_, _spider_)\n\nThis method is called when a spider or `process_spider_output()` method (from a previous spider middleware) raises an exception.\n\n`process_spider_exception()` should return either `None` or an iterable of `Request` or item objects.\n\nIf it returns `None`, Scrapy will continue processing this exception, executing any other `process_spider_exception()` in the following middleware components, until no middleware components are left and the exception reaches the engine (where it’s logged and discarded).\n\nIf it returns an iterable the `process_spider_output()` pipeline kicks in, starting from the next spider middleware, and no other `process_spider_exception()` will be called.\n\nParameters:\n- **response** ( `Response` object) – the response being processed when the exception was raised\n- **exception** ( `Exception` object) – the exception raised\n- **spider** ( `Spider` object) – the spider which raised the exception\n\nprocess_start_requests( _start_requests_, _spider_)\n\nThis method is called with the start requests of the spider, and works similarly to the `process_spider_output()` method, except that it doesn’t have a response associated and must return only requests (not items).\n\nIt receives an iterable (in the `start_requests` parameter) and must return another iterable of `Request` objects and/or item objects.\n\nNote\nWhen implementing this method in your spider middleware, you should always return an iterable (that follows the input one) and not consume all `start_requests` iterator because it can be very large (or even unbounded) and cause a memory overflow. The Scrapy engine is designed to pull start requests while it has capacity to process them, so the start requests iterator can be effectively endless where there is some other condition for stopping the spider (like a time limit or item/page count).\n\nParameters:\n- **start_requests** (an iterable of `Request`) – the start requests\n- **spider** ( `Spider` object) – the spider to whom the start requests belong\n\nfrom_crawler( _cls_, _crawler_)\n\nIf present, this classmethod is called to create a middleware instance from a `Crawler`. It must return a new instance of the middleware.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Selecting dynamically-loaded content is in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Selecting dynamically-loaded content in scrapy-latest.\n\n# Selecting dynamically-loaded content\n\nThis page covers how to select and extract dynamically-loaded content from webpages using Scrapy, including finding data sources, inspecting source code, reproducing requests, and handling different response formats.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Finding the data source\n\nTo extract the desired data, you must first find its source location.\n\nIf the data is in a non-text-based format, such as an image or a PDF document,\nuse the network tool of your web browser to find the corresponding request, and reproduce it.\n\nIf your web browser lets you select the desired data as text, the data may be\ndefined in embedded JavaScript code, or loaded from an external resource in a text-based format.\n\nIn that case, you can use a tool like wgrep to find the URL of that resource.\n\nIf the data turns out to come from the original URL itself, you must inspect the source code of the webpage to determine where the data is located.\n\nIf the data comes from a different URL, you will need to reproduce the corresponding request.\n\n## Inspecting the source code of a webpage\n\nSometimes you need to inspect the source code of a webpage (not the DOM) to determine where some desired data is located.\n\nUse Scrapy’s fetch command to download the webpage contents as seen by Scrapy:\n\n```\nscrapy fetch --nolog https://example.com > response.html\n```\n\nIf the desired data is in embedded JavaScript code within a <script/> element, see Parsing JavaScript code.\n\nIf you cannot find the desired data, first make sure it’s not just Scrapy: download the webpage with an HTTP client like curl or wget and see if the information can be found in the response they get.\n\nIf they get a response with the desired data, modify your Scrapy Request to match that of the other HTTP client. For example, try using the same user-agent string (USER_AGENT) or the same headers.\n\nIf they also get a response without the desired data, you’ll need to take steps to make your request more similar to that of the web browser. See Reproducing requests.\n\n## Reproducing requests\n\nSometimes we need to reproduce a request the way our web browser performs it.\n\nUse the network tool of your web browser to see how your web browser performs the desired request, and try to reproduce that request with Scrapy.\n\nIt might be enough to yield a Request with the same HTTP method and URL. However, you may also need to reproduce the body, headers and form parameters (see FormRequest) of that request.\n\nAs all major browsers allow to export the requests in curl format, Scrapy incorporates the method from_curl() to generate an equivalent Request from a cURL command. To get more information visit request from curl inside the network tool section.\n\nOnce you get the expected response, you can extract the desired data from it.\n\nYou can reproduce any request with Scrapy. However, some times reproducing all necessary requests may not seem efficient in developer time. If that is your case, and crawling speed is not a major concern for you, you can alternatively consider JavaScript pre-rendering.\n\nIf you get the expected response sometimes, but not always, the issue is probably not your request, but the target server. The target server might be buggy, overloaded, or banning some of your requests.\n\nNote that to translate a cURL command into a Scrapy request, you may use curl2scrapy.\n\n## Handling different response formats\n\nOnce you have a response with the desired data, how you extract the desired data from it depends on the type of response:\n\n- If the response is HTML, XML or JSON, use selectors as usual.\n\n- If the response is JSON, use response.json() to load the desired data:\n\n```\ndata = response.json()\n```\n\nIf the desired data is inside HTML or XML code embedded within JSON data, you can load that HTML or XML code into a Selector and then use it as usual:\n\n```\nselector = Selector(data[\"html\"])\n```\n\n- If the response is JavaScript, or HTML with a <script/> element containing the desired data, see Parsing JavaScript code.\n\n- If the response is CSS, use a regular expression to extract the desired data from response.text.\n\n- If the response is an image or another format based on images (e.g. PDF), read the response as bytes from response.body and use an OCR solution to extract the desired data as text.\n\nFor example, you can use pytesseract. To read a table from a PDF, tabula-py may be a better choice.\n\n- If the response is SVG, or HTML with embedded SVG containing the desired data, you may be able to extract the desired data using selectors, since SVG is based on XML.\n\nOtherwise, you might need to convert the SVG code into a raster image, and handle that raster image.\n\n## Parsing JavaScript code\n\nIf the desired data is hardcoded in JavaScript, you first need to get the JavaScript code:\n\n- If the JavaScript code is in a JavaScript file, simply read response.text.\n\n- If the JavaScript code is within a <script/> element of an HTML page, use selectors to extract the text within that <script/> element.\n\nOnce you have a string with the JavaScript code, you can extract the desired data from it:\n\n- You might be able to use a regular expression to extract the desired data in JSON format, which you can then parse with json.loads().\n\nFor example, if the JavaScript code contains a separate line like var data = {\"field\": \"value\"}; you can extract that data as follows:\n\n```\n>>> pattern = r\"\\bvar\\s+data\\s*=\\s*(\\{.*?\\})\\s*;\\s*\\n\"\n>>> json_data = response.css(\"script::text\").re_first(pattern)\n>>> json.loads(json_data)\n{'field': 'value'}\n```\n\n- chompjs provides an API to parse JavaScript objects into a dict.\n\nFor example, if the JavaScript code contains var data = {field: \"value\", secondField: \"second value\"}; you can extract that data as follows:\n\n```\n>>> import chompjs\n>>> javascript = response.css(\"script::text\").get()\n>>> data = chompjs.parse_js_object(javascript)\n>>> data\n{'field': 'value', 'secondField': 'second value'}\n```\n\n- Otherwise, use js2xml to convert the JavaScript code into an XML document that you can parse using selectors.\n\n## Pre-rendering JavaScript\n\nOn webpages that fetch data from additional requests, reproducing those requests that contain the desired data is the preferred approach. The effort is often worth the result: structured, complete data with minimum parsing time and network transfer.\n\nHowever, sometimes it can be really hard to reproduce certain requests. Or you may need something that no request can give you, such as a screenshot of a webpage as seen in a web browser.\n\nIn these cases use the Splash JavaScript-rendering service, along with scrapy-splash for seamless integration.\n\n## Using a headless browser\n\nA headless browser is a special web browser that provides an API for automation. By installing the asyncio reactor, it is possible to integrate asyncio-based libraries which handle headless browsers.\n\nOne such library is playwright-python (an official Python port of playwright). The following is a simple snippet to illustrate its usage within a Scrapy spider:\n\n```\nimport scrapy\nfrom playwright.async_api import async_playwright\n\nclass PlaywrightSpider(scrapy.Spider):\n    name = \"playwright\"\n    start_urls = [\"data:,\"]  # avoid using the default Scrapy downloader\n\n    async def parse(self, response):\n        async with async_playwright() as pw:\n            browser = await pw.chromium.launch()\n            page = await browser.new_page()\n            await page.goto(\"https://example.org\")\n            title = await page.title()\n            return {\"title\": title}\n```\n\nHowever, using playwright-python directly as in the above example circumvents most of the Scrapy components (middlewares, dupefilter, etc). We recommend using scrapy-playwright for a better integration.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/dynamic-content.html", "title": "Selecting dynamically-loaded content", "description": "This page covers how to select and extract dynamically-loaded content from webpages using Scrapy, including finding data sources, inspecting source code, reproducing requests, and handling different response formats.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 7, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 03:57:19", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"readthedocs-resolver-filename": "/topics/dynamic-content.html", "readthedocs-project-slug": "scrapy", "generator": "Docutils 0.19: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/", "readthedocs-version-slug": "latest", "readthedocs-http-status": "200", "language": "en", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "title": "Selecting dynamically-loaded content — Scrapy 2.12.0 documentation", "scrapeId": "80a86b70-72ed-47b8-b758-00c491a24e7e", "sourceURL": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/dynamic-content.html", "url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/dynamic-content.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Downloading and processing files and images is in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Downloading and processing files and images in scrapy-latest.\n\n# Downloading and processing files and images\n\nScrapy provides reusable item pipelines for downloading files attached to a particular item, such as images when scraping products. These pipelines include the Files Pipeline and the Images Pipeline, each with specific features for handling media.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Overview\n\nScrapy provides reusable item pipelines for downloading files attached to a particular item (for example, when you scrape products and also want to download their images locally). These pipelines share a bit of functionality and structure (we refer to them as media pipelines), but typically you’ll either use the Files Pipeline or the Images Pipeline.\n\nBoth pipelines implement these features:\n\n- Avoid re-downloading media that was downloaded recently\n- Specifying where to store the media (filesystem directory, FTP server, Amazon S3 bucket, Google Cloud Storage bucket)\n\nThe Images Pipeline has a few extra functions for processing images:\n\n- Convert all downloaded images to a common format (JPG) and mode (RGB)\n- Thumbnail generation\n- Check images width/height to make sure they meet a minimum constraint\n\nThe pipelines also keep an internal queue of those media URLs which are currently being scheduled for download, and connect those responses that arrive containing the same media to that queue. This avoids downloading the same media more than once when it’s shared by several items.\n\n## Using the Files Pipeline\n\nThe typical workflow, when using the `FilesPipeline` goes like this:\n\n1. In a Spider, you scrape an item and put the URLs of the desired into a `file_urls` field.\n2. The item is returned from the spider and goes to the item pipeline.\n3. When the item reaches the `FilesPipeline`, the URLs in the `file_urls` field are scheduled for download using the standard Scrapy scheduler and downloader (which means the scheduler and downloader middlewares are reused), but with a higher priority, processing them before other pages are scraped. The item remains “locked” at that particular pipeline stage until the files have finished downloading (or fail for some reason).\n4. When the files are downloaded, another field ( `files`) will be populated with the results. This field will contain a list of dicts with information about the downloaded files, such as the downloaded path, the original scraped url (taken from the `file_urls` field), the file checksum and the file status. The files in the list of the `files` field will retain the same order of the original `file_urls` field. If some file failed downloading, an error will be logged and the file won’t be present in the `files` field.\n\n## Using the Images Pipeline\n\nUsing the [`ImagesPipeline`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/media-pipeline.html#scrapy.pipelines.images.ImagesPipeline) is a lot like using the `FilesPipeline`, except the default field names used are different: you use `image_urls` for the image URLs of an item and it will populate an `images` field for the information about the downloaded images.\n\nThe advantage of using the [`ImagesPipeline`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/media-pipeline.html#scrapy.pipelines.images.ImagesPipeline) for image files is that you can configure some extra functions like generating thumbnails and filtering the images based on their size.\n\nThe Images Pipeline requires [Pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow) 7.1.0 or greater. It is used for thumbnailing and normalizing images to JPEG/RGB format.\n\n## Enabling your Media Pipeline\n\nTo enable your media pipeline you must first add it to your project [`ITEM_PIPELINES`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html#std-setting-ITEM_PIPELINES) setting.\n\nFor Images Pipeline, use:\n```\nITEM_PIPELINES = {\"scrapy.pipelines.images.ImagesPipeline\": 1}\n```\nFor Files Pipeline, use:\n```\nITEM_PIPELINES = {\"scrapy.pipelines.files.FilesPipeline\": 1}\n```\nNote: You can also use both the Files and Images Pipeline at the same time.\n\nThen, configure the target storage setting to a valid value that will be used for storing the downloaded images. Otherwise the pipeline will remain disabled, even if you include it in the [`ITEM_PIPELINES`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html#std-setting-ITEM_PIPELINES) setting.\n\nFor the Files Pipeline, set the [`FILES_STORE`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/media-pipeline.html#std-setting-FILES_STORE) setting:\n```\nFILES_STORE = \"/path/to/valid/dir\"\n```\nFor the Images Pipeline, set the [`IMAGES_STORE`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/media-pipeline.html#std-setting-IMAGES_STORE) setting:\n```\nIMAGES_STORE = \"/path/to/valid/dir\"\n```\n\n## File Naming\n\n### Default File Naming\nBy default, files are stored using an [SHA-1 hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA_hash_functions) of their URLs for the file names.\nFor example, the following image URL:\n```\nhttp://www.example.com/image.jpg\n```\nWhose `SHA-1 hash` is:\n```\n3afec3b4765f8f0a07b78f98c07b83f013567a0a\n```\nWill be downloaded and stored using your chosen [storage method](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/media-pipeline.html#topics-supported-storage) and the following file name:\n```\n3afec3b4765f8f0a07b78f98c07b83f013567a0a.jpg\n```\n### Custom File Naming\nYou may wish to use a different calculated file name for saved files. For example, classifying an image by including meta in the file name.\nCustomize file names by overriding the `file_path` method of your media pipeline.\nFor example, an image pipeline with image URL:\n```\nhttp://www.example.com/product/images/large/front/0000000004166\n```\nCan be processed into a file name with a condensed hash and the perspective `front`:\n```\n00b08510e4_front.jpg\n```\nBy overriding `file_path` like this:\n```\nimport hashlib\n\ndef file_path(self, request, response=None, info=None, *, item=None):\n    image_url_hash = hashlib.shake_256(request.url.encode()).hexdigest(5)\n    image_perspective = request.url.split(\"/\")[-2]\n    image_filename = f\"{image_url_hash}_{image_perspective}.jpg\"\n\n    return image_filename\n```\n### Warning\nIf your custom file name scheme relies on meta data that can vary between scrapes it may lead to unexpected re-downloading of existing media using new file names.\n\n## Supported Storage\n\n### File system storage\nFile system storage will save files to the following path:\n```\n<IMAGES_STORE>/full/<FILE_NAME>\n```\nWhere:\n- `<IMAGES_STORE>` is the directory defined in [`IMAGES_STORE`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/media-pipeline.html#std-setting-IMAGES_STORE) setting for the Images Pipeline.\n- `full` is a sub-directory to separate full images from thumbnails (if used).\n- `<FILE_NAME>` is the file name assigned to the file.\n\n### FTP server storage\nNew in version 2.0.\n[`FILES_STORE`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/media-pipeline.html#std-setting-FILES_STORE) and [`IMAGES_STORE`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/media-pipeline.html#std-setting-IMAGES_STORE) can point to an FTP server. Scrapy will automatically upload the files to the server.\n\n### Amazon S3 storage\nIf [botocore](https://github.com/boto/botocore) >= 1.4.87 is installed, [`FILES_STORE`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/media-pipeline.html#std-setting-FILES_STORE) and [`IMAGES_STORE`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/media-pipeline.html#std-setting-IMAGES_STORE) can represent an Amazon S3 bucket. Scrapy will automatically upload the files to the bucket.\n\n### Google Cloud Storage\n[`FILES_STORE`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/media-pipeline.html#std-setting-FILES_STORE) and [`IMAGES_STORE`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/media-pipeline.html#std-setting-IMAGES_STORE) can represent a Google Cloud Storage bucket. Scrapy will automatically upload the files to the bucket.\n\n## Usage example\n\nIn order to use a media pipeline, first [enable it](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/media-pipeline.html#topics-media-pipeline-enabling).\nThen, if a spider returns an [item object](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/items.html#topics-items) with the URLs field ( `file_urls` or `image_urls`, for the Files or Images Pipeline respectively), the pipeline will put the results under the respective field ( `files` or `images`).\nWhen using [item types](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/items.html#item-types) for which fields are defined beforehand, you must define both the URLs field and the results field. For example, when using the images pipeline, items must define both the `image_urls` and the `images` field. For instance, using the [`Item`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/items.html#scrapy.Item \"scrapy.Item\") class:\n```\nimport scrapy\n\nclass MyItem(scrapy.Item):\n    # ... other item fields ...\n    image_urls = scrapy.Field()\n    images = scrapy.Field()\n```\nIf you want to use another field name for the URLs key or for the results key, it is also possible to override it.\n\n## Additional features\n\n### File expiration\nThe Image Pipeline avoids downloading files that were downloaded recently. To adjust this retention delay use the [`FILES_EXPIRES`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/media-pipeline.html#std-setting-FILES_EXPIRES) setting (or [`IMAGES_EXPIRES`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/media-pipeline.html#std-setting-IMAGES_EXPIRES), in case of Images Pipeline), which specifies the delay in number of days:\n```\n# 120 days of delay for files expiration\nFILES_EXPIRES = 120\n\n# 30 days of delay for images expiration\nIMAGES_EXPIRES = 30\n```\n### Thumbnail generation for images\nThe Images Pipeline can automatically create thumbnails of the downloaded images.\nIn order to use this feature, you must set [`IMAGES_THUMBS`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/media-pipeline.html#std-setting-IMAGES_THUMBS) to a dictionary where the keys are the thumbnail names and the values are their dimensions.\nFor example:\n```\nIMAGES_THUMBS = {\n    \"small\": (50, 50),\n    \"big\": (270, 270),\n}\n```\n### Filtering out small images\nWhen using the Images Pipeline, you can drop images which are too small, by specifying the minimum allowed size in the [`IMAGES_MIN_HEIGHT`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/media-pipeline.html#std-setting-IMAGES_MIN_HEIGHT) and [`IMAGES_MIN_WIDTH`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/media-pipeline.html#std-setting-IMAGES_MIN_WIDTH) settings.\nFor example:\n```\nIMAGES_MIN_HEIGHT = 110\nIMAGES_MIN_WIDTH = 110\n```\n### Allowing redirections\nBy default media pipelines ignore redirects, i.e. an HTTP redirection to a media file URL request will mean the media download is considered failed.\nTo handle media redirections, set this setting to `True`:\n```\nMEDIA_ALLOW_REDIRECTS = True\n```\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/media-pipeline.html", "title": "Downloading and processing files and images", "description": "Scrapy provides reusable item pipelines for downloading files attached to a particular item, such as images when scraping products.

To adjust this retention delay use the [`FILES_EXPIRES`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/media-pipeline.html#std-setting-FILES_EXPIRES) setting (or [`IMAGES_EXPIRES`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/media-pipeline.html#std-setting-IMAGES_EXPIRES), in case of Images Pipeline), which specifies the delay in number of days:\n```\n# 120 days of delay for files expiration\nFILES_EXPIRES = 120\n\n# 30 days of delay for images expiration\nIMAGES_EXPIRES = 30\n```\n### Thumbnail generation for images\nThe Images Pipeline can automatically create thumbnails of the downloaded images.\nIn order to use this feature, you must set [`IMAGES_THUMBS`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/media-pipeline.html#std-setting-IMAGES_THUMBS) to a dictionary where the keys are the thumbnail names and the values are their dimensions.\nFor example:\n```\nIMAGES_THUMBS = {\n    \"small\": (50, 50),\n    \"big\": (270, 270),\n}\n```\n### Filtering out small images\nWhen using the Images Pipeline, you can drop images which are too small, by specifying the minimum allowed size in the [`IMAGES_MIN_HEIGHT`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/media-pipeline.html#std-setting-IMAGES_MIN_HEIGHT) and [`IMAGES_MIN_WIDTH`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/media-pipeline.html#std-setting-IMAGES_MIN_WIDTH) settings.\nFor example:\n```\nIMAGES_MIN_HEIGHT = 110\nIMAGES_MIN_WIDTH = 110\n```\n### Allowing redirections\nBy default media pipelines ignore redirects, i.e. an HTTP redirection to a media file URL request will mean the media download is considered failed.\nTo handle media redirections, set this setting to `True`:\n```\nMEDIA_ALLOW_REDIRECTS = True\n```.\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/media-pipeline.html", "title": "Downloading and processing files and images", "description": "Scrapy provides reusable item pipelines for downloading files attached to a particular item, such as images when scraping products.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Item Pipeline is in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Item Pipeline in scrapy-latest.\n\n# Item Pipeline\n\nAfter an item has been scraped by a spider, it is sent to the Item Pipeline which processes it through several components that are executed sequentially.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Item Pipeline\n\nAfter an item has been scraped by a spider, it is sent to the Item Pipeline which processes it through several components that are executed sequentially.\n\nEach item pipeline component (sometimes referred as just “Item Pipeline”) is a Python class that implements a simple method. They receive an item and perform an action over it, also deciding if the item should continue through the pipeline or be dropped and no longer processed.\n\nTypical uses of item pipelines are:\n\n- cleansing HTML data\n- validating scraped data (checking that the items contain certain fields)\n- checking for duplicates (and dropping them)\n- storing the scraped item in a database\n\n## Writing your own item pipeline\n\nEach item pipeline component is a Python class that must implement the following method:\n\nprocess_item( _self_, _item_, _spider_)\n\nThis method is called for every item pipeline component.\n\nitem is an [item object](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/items.html#item-types), see [Supporting All Item Types](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/items.html#supporting-item-types).\n\nprocess_item() must either: return an [item object](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/items.html#item-types), return a [Deferred](https://docs.twisted.org/en/stable/api/twisted.internet.defer.Deferred.html) or raise a [DropItem](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/exceptions.html#scrapy.exceptions.DropItem) exception.\n\nDropped items are no longer processed by further pipeline components.\n\nParameters:\n\n- **item** ( [item object](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/items.html#item-types)) – the scraped item\n- **spider** ( [Spider](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spiders.html#scrapy.Spider) object) – the spider which scraped the item\n\nAdditionally, they may also implement the following methods:\n\nopen_spider( _self_, _spider_)\n\nThis method is called when the spider is opened.\n\nParameters:\n\n**spider** ( [Spider](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spiders.html#scrapy.Spider) object) – the spider which was opened\n\nclose_spider( _self_, _spider_)\n\nThis method is called when the spider is closed.\n\nParameters:\n\n**spider** ( [Spider](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spiders.html#scrapy.Spider) object) – the spider which was closed\n\n_classmethod_ from_crawler( _cls_, _crawler_)\n\nIf present, this class method is called to create a pipeline instance from a [Crawler](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/api.html#scrapy.crawler.Crawler). It must return a new instance of the pipeline. Crawler object provides access to all Scrapy core components like settings and signals; it is a way for pipeline to access them and hook its functionality into Scrapy.\n\nParameters:\n\n**crawler** ( [Crawler](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/api.html#scrapy.crawler.Crawler) object) – crawler that uses this pipeline.\n\n## Item pipeline example\n\n### Price validation and dropping items with no prices\nLet’s take a look at the following hypothetical pipeline that adjusts the `price` attribute for those items that do not include VAT ( `price_excludes_vat` attribute), and drops those items which don’t contain a price:\n\n```python\nfrom itemadapter import ItemAdapter\nfrom scrapy.exceptions import DropItem\n\nclass PricePipeline:\n    vat_factor = 1.15\n\n    def process_item(self, item, spider):\n        adapter = ItemAdapter(item)\n        if adapter.get(\"price\"):\n            if adapter.get(\"price_excludes_vat\"):\n                adapter[\"price\"] = adapter[\"price\"] * self.vat_factor\n            return item\n        else:\n            raise DropItem(\"Missing price\")\n```\n\n### Write items to a JSON lines file\nThe following pipeline stores all scraped items (from all spiders) into a single `items.jsonl` file, containing one item per line serialized in JSON format:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\nfrom itemadapter import ItemAdapter\n\nclass JsonWriterPipeline:\n    def open_spider(self, spider):\n        self.file = open(\"items.jsonl\", \"w\")\n\n    def close_spider(self, spider):\n        self.file.close()\n\n    def process_item(self, item, spider):\n        line = json.dumps(ItemAdapter(item).asdict()) + \"\\n\"\n        self.file.write(line)\n        return item\n```\n\nNote\nThe purpose of JsonWriterPipeline is just to introduce how to write item pipelines. If you really want to store all scraped items into a JSON file you should use the [Feed exports](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/feed-exports.html#topics-feed-exports).\n\n### Write items to MongoDB\nIn this example we’ll write items to [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) using [pymongo](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). MongoDB address and database name are specified in Scrapy settings; MongoDB collection is named after item class.\n\nThe main point of this example is to show how to use [`from_crawler()`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/item-pipeline.html#from_crawler) method and how to clean up the resources properly.\n\n```python\nimport pymongo\nfrom itemadapter import ItemAdapter\n\nclass MongoPipeline:\n    collection_name = \"scrapy_items\"\n\n    def __init__(self, mongo_uri, mongo_db):\n        self.mongo_uri = mongo_uri\n        self.mongo_db = mongo_db\n\n    @classmethod\n    def from_crawler(cls, crawler):\n        return cls(\n            mongo_uri=crawler.settings.get(\"MONGO_URI\"),\n            mongo_db=crawler.settings.get(\"MONGO_DATABASE\", \"items\"),\n        )\n\n    def open_spider(self, spider):\n        self.client = pymongo.MongoClient(self.mongo_uri)\n        self.db = self.client[self.mongo_db]\n\n    def close_spider(self, spider):\n        self.client.close()\n\n    def process_item(self, item, spider):\n        self.db[self.collection_name].insert_one(ItemAdapter(item).asdict())\n        return item\n```\n\n### Take screenshot of item\nThis example demonstrates how to use [coroutine syntax](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/coroutines.html) in the [`process_item()`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/item-pipeline.html#process_item) method.\n\nThis item pipeline makes a request to a locally-running instance of [Splash](https://splash.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to render a screenshot of the item URL. After the request response is downloaded, the item pipeline saves the screenshot to a file and adds the filename to the item.\n\n```python\nimport hashlib\nfrom pathlib import Path\nfrom urllib.parse import quote\n\nimport scrapy\nfrom itemadapter import ItemAdapter\nfrom scrapy.http.request import NO_CALLBACK\nfrom scrapy.utils.defer import maybe_deferred_to_future\n\nclass ScreenshotPipeline:\n    \"\"\"Pipeline that uses Splash to render screenshot of every Scrapy item.\"\"\"\n\n    SPLASH_URL = \"http://localhost:8050/render.png?url={}\" \n\n    async def process_item(self, item, spider):\n        adapter = ItemAdapter(item)\n        encoded_item_url = quote(adapter[\"url\"])\n        screenshot_url = self.SPLASH_URL.format(encoded_item_url)\n        request = scrapy.Request(screenshot_url, callback=NO_CALLBACK)\n        response = await maybe_deferred_to_future(\n            spider.crawler.engine.download(request)\n        )\n\n        if response.status != 200:\n            # Error happened, return item.\n            return item\n\n        # Save screenshot to file, filename will be hash of url.\n        url = adapter[\"url\"]\n        url_hash = hashlib.md5(url.encode(\"utf8\")).hexdigest()\n        filename = f\"{url_hash}.png\"\n        Path(filename).write_bytes(response.body)\n\n        # Store filename in item.\n        adapter[\"screenshot_filename\"] = filename\n        return item\n```\n\n### Duplicates filter\nA filter that looks for duplicate items, and drops those items that were already processed. Let’s say that our items have a unique id, but our spider returns multiples items with the same id:\n\n```python\nfrom itemadapter import ItemAdapter\nfrom scrapy.exceptions import DropItem\n\nclass DuplicatesPipeline:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.ids_seen = set()\n\n    def process_item(self, item, spider):\n        adapter = ItemAdapter(item)\n        if adapter[\"id\"] in self.ids_seen:\n            raise DropItem(f\"Item ID already seen: {adapter['id']}\")\n        else:\n            self.ids_seen.add(adapter[\"id\"])\n            return item\n```\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/item-pipeline.html", "title": "Item Pipeline", "description": "After an item has been scraped by a spider, it is sent to the Item Pipeline which processes it through several components that are executed sequentially.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 3, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 04:00:00", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"readthedocs-http-status": "200", "title": "Item Pipeline — Scrapy 2.12.0 documentation", "generator": "Docutils 0.19: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/", "readthedocs-resolver-filename": "/topics/item-pipeline.html", "readthedocs-version-slug": "latest", "language": "en", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "readthedocs-project-slug": "scrapy", "scrapeId": "5c5d181e-ee99-4c8a-b9c1-c23c0900ce15", "sourceURL": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/item-pipeline.html", "url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/item-pipeline.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Requests and Responses is in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Requests and Responses in scrapy-latest.\n\n# Requests and Responses\n\nScrapy uses Request and Response objects for crawling web sites.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Request objects\n\nclass scrapy.http.Request(*args:Any, **kwargs:Any) [source]\n\nRepresents an HTTP request, which is usually generated in a Spider and executed by the Downloader, thus generating a Response object.\n\nParameters:\n\n- **url** (str) – the URL of this request\n\nIf the URL is invalid, a ValueError exception is raised.\n\n- **callback** (collections.abc.Callable) – the function that will be called with the response of this request (once it’s downloaded) as its first parameter.\n\nIn addition to a function, the following values are supported:\n\n  - None (default), which indicates that the spider’s parse() method must be used.\n\n  - NO_CALLBACK()\n\nFor more information, see Passing additional data to callback functions.\n\nNote\n\nIf exceptions are raised during processing, errback is called instead.\n\n- **method** (str) – the HTTP method of this request. Defaults to 'GET'.\n\n- **meta** (dict) – the initial values for the Request.meta attribute. If given, the dict passed in this parameter will be shallow copied.\n\n- **body** (bytes or str) – the request body. If a string is passed, then it’s encoded as bytes using the encoding passed (which defaults to utf-8). If body is not given, an empty bytes object is stored. Regardless of the type of this argument, the final value stored will be a bytes object (never a string or None).\n\n- **headers** (dict) – the headers of this request. The dict values can be strings (for single valued headers) or lists (for multi-valued headers). If None is passed as value, the HTTP header will not be sent at all.\n\nCaution\n\nCookies set via the Cookie header are not considered by the CookiesMiddleware. If you need to set cookies for a request, use the Request.cookies parameter. This is a known current limitation that is being worked on.\n\n- **cookies** (dict or list) – the request cookies. These can be sent in two forms.\n\n1. Using a dict:\n\n```\nrequest_with_cookies = Request(\n    url=\"http://www.example.com\",\n    cookies={\"currency\": \"USD\", \"country\": \"UY\"},\n)\n```\n\n2. Using a list of dicts:\n\n```\nrequest_with_cookies = Request(\n    url=\"https://www.example.com\",\n    cookies=[\n        {\n            \"name\": \"currency\",\n            \"value\": \"USD\",\n            \"domain\": \"example.com\",\n            \"path\": \"/currency\",\n            \"secure\": True,\n        },\n    ],\n)\n```\n\nThe latter form allows for customizing the domain and path attributes of the cookie. This is only useful if the cookies are saved for later requests.\n\nWhen some site returns cookies (in a response) those are stored in the cookies for that domain and will be sent again in future requests. That’s the typical behaviour of any regular web browser.\n\nNote that setting the dont_merge_cookies key to True in request.meta causes custom cookies to be ignored.\n\nFor more info see CookiesMiddleware.\n\nCaution\n\nCookies set via the Cookie header are not considered by the CookiesMiddleware. If you need to set cookies for a request, use the Request.cookies parameter. This is a known current limitation that is being worked on.\n\nNew in version 2.6.0: Cookie values that are bool, float or int are casted to str.\n\n- **encoding** (str) – the encoding of this request (defaults to 'utf-8'). This encoding will be used to percent-encode the URL and to convert the body to bytes (if given as a string).\n\n- **priority** (int) – the priority of this request (defaults to 0). The priority is used by the scheduler to define the order used to process requests. Requests with a higher priority value will execute earlier. Negative values are allowed in order to indicate relatively low-priority.\n\n- **dont_filter** (bool) – indicates that this request should not be filtered by the scheduler. This is used when you want to perform an identical request multiple times, to ignore the duplicates filter. Use it with care, or you will get into crawling loops. Default to False.\n\n- **errback** (collections.abc.Callable) – a function that will be called if any exception was raised while processing the request. This includes pages that failed with 404 HTTP errors and such. It receives a Failure as first parameter. For more information, see Using errbacks to catch exceptions in request processing below.\n\nChanged in version 2.0: The callback parameter is no longer required when the errback parameter is specified.\n\n- **flags** (list) – Flags sent to the request, can be used for logging or similar purposes.\n\n- **cb_kwargs** (dict) – A dict with arbitrary data that will be passed as keyword arguments to the Request’s callback.\n\n## Other functions related to requests\n\nscrapy.http.request.NO_CALLBACK(*args:Any, **kwargs:Any)→NoReturn [source]\n\nWhen assigned to the callback parameter of Request, it indicates that the request is not meant to have a spider callback at all.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nRequest(\"https://example.com\", callback=NO_CALLBACK)\n```\n\nThis value should be used by components that create and handle their own requests, e.g. through scrapy.core.engine.ExecutionEngine.download(), so that downloader middlewares handling such requests can treat them differently from requests intended for the parse() callback.\n\nscrapy.utils.request.request_from_dict(d:dict, *args, spider:Spider | None=None)→Request [source]\n\nCreate a Request object from a dict.\n\nIf a spider is given, it will try to resolve the callbacks looking at the spider for methods with the same name.\n\n## Request usage examples\n\nUsing FormRequest to send data via HTTP POST\n\nIf you want to simulate a HTML Form POST in your spider and send a couple of key-value fields, you can return a FormRequest object (from your spider) like this:\n\n```\nreturn [\n    FormRequest(\n        url=\"http://www.example.com/post/action\",\n        formdata={\"name\": \"John Doe\", \"age\": \"27\"},\n        callback=self.after_post,\n    )\n]\n```\n\nUsing FormRequest.from_response() to simulate a user login\n\nIt is usual for web sites to provide pre-populated form fields through <input type=\"hidden\"> elements, such as session related data or authentication tokens (for login pages). When scraping, you’ll want these fields to be automatically pre-populated and only override a couple of them, such as the user name and password. You can use the FormRequest.from_response() method for this job. Here’s an example spider which uses it:\n\n```\nimport scrapy\n\ndef authentication_failed(response):\n    # TODO: Check the contents of the response and return True if it failed\n    # or False if it succeeded.\n    pass\n\nclass LoginSpider(scrapy.Spider):\n    name = \"example.com\"\n    start_urls = [\"http://www.example.com/users/login.php\"]\n\n    def parse(self, response):\n        return scrapy.FormRequest.from_response(\n            response,\n            formdata={\"username\": \"john\", \"password\": \"secret\"},\n            callback=self.after_login,\n        )\n\n    def after_login(self, response):\n        if authentication_failed(response):\n            self.logger.error(\"Login failed\")\n            return\n\n        # continue scraping with authenticated session...\n```\n\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/request-response.html", "title": "Requests and Responses", "description": "Scrapy uses Request and Response objects for crawling web sites.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 3, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 04:08:56", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"readthedocs-project-slug": "scrapy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "readthedocs-version-slug": "latest", "title": "Requests and Responses — Scrapy 2.12.0 documentation", "readthedocs-resolver-filename": "/topics/request-response.html", "generator": "Docutils 0.19: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/", "language": "en", "readthedocs-http-status": "200", "scrapeId": "57499666-04fd-43c7-9796-d2922f573c70", "sourceURL": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/request-response.html", "url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/request-response.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

These are called “broad crawls” and is the typical crawlers employed by search engines.\n\nThese are some common properties often found in broad crawls:\n\n- they crawl many domains (often, unbounded) instead of a specific set of sites\n- they don’t necessarily crawl domains to completion, because it would be impractical (or impossible) to do so, and instead limit the crawl by time or number of pages crawled\n- they are simpler in logic (as opposed to very complex spiders with many extraction rules) because data is often post-processed in a separate stage\n- they crawl many domains concurrently, which allows them to achieve faster crawl speeds by not being limited by any particular site constraint (each site is crawled slowly to respect politeness, but many sites are crawled in parallel).\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/broad-crawls.html", "title": "Broad Crawls", "description": "This page summarizes some things you need to keep in mind when using Scrapy for doing broad crawls, along with concrete suggestions of Scrapy settings to tune in order to achieve an efficient broad crawl.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 1, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 04:12:26", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"readthedocs-resolver-filename": "/topics/broad-crawls.html", "language": "en", "generator": "Docutils 0.19: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/", "readthedocs-project-slug": "scrapy", "readthedocs-http-status": "200", "readthedocs-version-slug": "latest", "title": "Broad Crawls — Scrapy 2.12.0 documentation", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "scrapeId": "08209e57-09da-44eb-8c97-582fc6289f2f", "sourceURL": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/broad-crawls.html", "url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/broad-crawls.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

Spiders may return the extracted data as items, Python objects that define key-value pairs.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Item Types\n\nScrapy supports the following types of items, via the itemadapter library: dictionaries, Item objects, dataclass objects, and attrs objects.\n\n## Dictionaries\n\nAs an item type, dict is convenient and familiar.\n\n## Item objects\n\nItem provides a dict-like API plus additional features that make it the most feature-complete item type. In Scrapy, an object is considered an item if it’s supported by the itemadapter library. Items must declare Field attributes, which are processed and stored in the fields attribute. This restricts the set of allowed field names and prevents typos, raising KeyError when referring to undefined fields.\n\n## Dataclass objects\n\nNew in version 2.2. dataclass allows the defining of item classes with field names, so that item exporters can export all fields by default even if the first scraped object does not have values for all of them.\n\n## attr.s objects\n\nNew in version 2.2. attr.s allows the defining of item classes with field names, so that item exporters can export all fields by default even if the first scraped object does not have values for all of them.\n\n## Working with Item objects\n\nItem subclasses are declared using a simple class definition syntax and Field objects.\n\n## Declaring fields\n\nField objects are used to specify metadata for each field. You can specify any kind of metadata for each field.\n\n## Working with Item objects\n\nHere are some examples of common tasks performed with items, using the Product item declared above.\n\n## Extending Item subclasses\n\nYou can extend Items (to add more fields or to change some metadata for some fields) by declaring a subclass of your original Item.\n\n## Supporting All Item Types\n\nIn code that receives an item, such as methods of item pipelines or spider middlewares, it is a good practice to use the ItemAdapter class and the is_item() function to write code that works for any supported item type.\n\n## Other classes related to items\n\nMetaclass of Item that handles field definitions.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/items.html?highlight=field", "title": "Items", "description": "The main goal in scraping is to extract structured data from unstructured sources, typically, web pages.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Scrapy shell is in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Scrapy shell in scrapy-latest.\n\n# Scrapy shell\n\nThe Scrapy shell is an interactive shell where you can try and debug your scraping code very quickly, without having to run the spider. It’s meant to be used for testing data extraction code, but you can actually use it for testing any kind of code as it is also a regular Python shell.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Configuring the shell\n\nIf you have [IPython](https://ipython.org/) installed, the Scrapy shell will use it (instead of the standard Python console). The [IPython](https://ipython.org/) console is much more powerful and provides smart auto-completion and colorized output, among other things.\n\nWe highly recommend you install [IPython](https://ipython.org/), specially if you’re working on Unix systems (where [IPython](https://ipython.org/) excels). See the [IPython installation guide](https://ipython.org/install.html) for more info.\n\nScrapy also has support for [bpython](https://bpython-interpreter.org/), and will try to use it where [IPython](https://ipython.org/) is unavailable.\n\nThrough Scrapy’s settings you can configure it to use any one of `ipython`, `bpython` or the standard `python` shell, regardless of which are installed. This is done by setting the `SCRAPY_PYTHON_SHELL` environment variable; or by defining it in your [scrapy.cfg](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/commands.html#topics-config-settings):\n\n```\n[settings]\nshell = bpython\n``\n\n## Launch the shell\n\nTo launch the Scrapy shell you can use the [`shell`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/commands.html#std-command-shell) command like this:\n\n```\nscrapy shell <url>\n```\n\nWhere the `<url>` is the URL you want to scrape.\n\n[`shell`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/commands.html#std-command-shell) also works for local files. This can be handy if you want to play around with a local copy of a web page. [`shell`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/commands.html#std-command-shell) understands the following syntaxes for local files:\n\n```\n# UNIX-style\nscrapy shell ./path/to/file.html\nscrapy shell ../other/path/to/file.html\nscrapy shell /absolute/path/to/file.html\n\n# File URI\nscrapy shell file:///absolute/path/to/file.html\n```\n\nNote\n\nWhen using relative file paths, be explicit and prepend them with `./` (or `../` when relevant).\n`scrapy shell index.html` will not work as one might expect (and this is by design, not a bug).\n\nBecause [`shell`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/commands.html#std-command-shell) favors HTTP URLs over File URIs, and `index.html` being syntactically similar to `example.com`, [`shell`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/commands.html#std-command-shell) will treat `index.html` as a domain name and trigger a DNS lookup error:\n\n```\n$ scrapy shell index.html\n[ ... scrapy shell starts ... ]\n[ ... traceback ... ]\ntwisted.internet.error.DNSLookupError: DNS lookup failed:\naddress 'index.html' not found: [Errno -5] No address associated with hostname.\n```\n\n[`shell`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/commands.html#std-command-shell) will not test beforehand if a file called `index.html` exists in the current directory. Again, be explicit.\n\n## Using the shell\n\nThe Scrapy shell is just a regular Python console (or [IPython](https://ipython.org/) console if you have it available) which provides some additional shortcut functions for convenience.\n\n### Available Shortcuts\n\n- `shelp()` \\- print a help with the list of available objects and shortcuts\n\n- `fetch(url[, redirect=True])` \\- fetch a new response from the given URL and update all related objects accordingly. You can optionally ask for HTTP 3xx redirections to not be followed by passing `redirect=False`\n\n- `fetch(request)` \\- fetch a new response from the given request and update all related objects accordingly.\n\n- `view(response)` \\- open the given response in your local web browser, for inspection. This will add a [<base> tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/base) to the response body in order for external links (such as images and style sheets) to display properly. Note, however, that this will create a temporary file in your computer, which won’t be removed automatically.\n\n### Available Scrapy objects\n\nThe Scrapy shell automatically creates some convenient objects from the downloaded page, like the [`Response`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/request-response.html#scrapy.http.Response \"scrapy.http.Response\") object and the `Selector` objects (for both HTML and XML content).\n\nThose objects are:\n\n- `crawler` \\- the current [`Crawler`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/api.html#scrapy.crawler.Crawler \"scrapy.crawler.Crawler\") object.\n\n- `spider` \\- the Spider which is known to handle the URL, or a [`Spider`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spiders.html#scrapy.Spider \"scrapy.Spider\") object if there is no spider found for the current URL\n\n- `request` \\- a `Request` object of the last fetched page. You can modify this request using `replace()` or fetch a new request (without leaving the shell) using the `fetch` shortcut.\n\n- `response` \\- a [`Response`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/request-response.html#scrapy.http.Response \"scrapy.http.Response\") object containing the last fetched page\n\n- `settings` \\- the current [Scrapy settings](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html#topics-settings)\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/shell.html?__hstc=199723825.2f3f33a24b44870ec4a577029c49e44b.1725667200263.1725667200264.1725667200265.1&__hssc=199723825.1.1725667200266&__hsfp=2420521548", "title": "Scrapy shell", "description": "The Scrapy shell is an interactive shell where you can try and debug your scraping code very quickly, without having to run the spider.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Spiders Contracts is in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Spiders Contracts in scrapy-latest.\n\n# Spiders Contracts\n\nTesting spiders can get particularly annoying and while nothing prevents you from writing unit tests the task gets cumbersome quickly. Scrapy offers an integrated way of testing your spiders by the means of contracts.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Introduction\n\nTesting spiders can get particularly annoying and while nothing prevents you from writing unit tests the task gets cumbersome quickly. Scrapy offers an integrated way of testing your spiders by the means of contracts.\n\n## Using Contracts\n\nThis allows you to test each callback of your spider by hardcoding a sample url and check various constraints for how the callback processes the response. Each contract is prefixed with an `@` and included in the docstring.\n\n## Available Contracts\n\nYou can use the following contracts:\n\n- **@url**: Sets the sample URL used when checking other contract conditions for this spider. This contract is mandatory. All callbacks lacking this contract are ignored when running the checks.\n- **@cb_kwargs**: Sets the `cb_kwargs` attribute for the sample request. It must be a valid JSON dictionary.\n- **@meta**: Sets the `meta` attribute for the sample request. It must be a valid JSON dictionary.\n- **@returns**: Sets lower and upper bounds for the items and requests returned by the spider. The upper bound is optional.\n- **@scrapes**: Checks that all the items returned by the callback have the specified fields.\n\n## Custom Contracts\n\nIf you find you need more power than the built-in Scrapy contracts you can create and load your own contracts in the project by using the `SPIDER_CONTRACTS` setting.\n\n## Contract Class\n\nEach contract must inherit from `Contract` and can override three methods: `adjust_request_args`, `pre_process`, and `post_process`.\n\n## Detecting Check Runs\n\nWhen `scrapy check` is running, the `SCRAPY_CHECK` environment variable is set to the `true` string. You can use `os.environ` to perform any change to your spiders or your settings when `scrapy check` is used.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/contracts.html?utm_campaign=EXS&utm_activity=BLO&utm_medium=ORG&utm_source=HUB&utm_content=BLP&utm_primary=EXS&utm_goal=SIN&__hstc=199723825.2f3f33a24b44870ec4a577029c49e44b.1730851201067.1730851201068.1730851201069.1&__hssc=199723825.1.1730851201070&__hsfp=1169088524", "title": "Spiders Contracts", "description": "Testing spiders can get particularly annoying and while nothing prevents you from writing unit tests the task gets cumbersome quickly.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Frequently Asked Questions is in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Frequently Asked Questions in scrapy-latest.\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n\nThis page contains frequently asked questions about Scrapy, covering various topics related to its usage, features, and best practices.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## How does Scrapy compare to BeautifulSoup or lxml?\n\n[BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) and [lxml](https://lxml.de/) are libraries for parsing HTML and XML. Scrapy is an application framework for writing web spiders that crawl web sites and extract data from them.\n\nScrapy provides a built-in mechanism for extracting data (called [selectors](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/selectors.html#topics-selectors)) but you can easily use [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) (or [lxml](https://lxml.de/)) instead, if you feel more comfortable working with them. After all, they’re just parsing libraries which can be imported and used from any Python code.\n\nIn other words, comparing [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) (or [lxml](https://lxml.de/)) to Scrapy is like comparing [jinja2](https://palletsprojects.com/projects/jinja/) to [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/).\n\n## Can I use Scrapy with BeautifulSoup?\n\nYes, you can.\nAs mentioned [above](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/faq.html#faq-scrapy-bs-cmp), [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) can be used for parsing HTML responses in Scrapy callbacks.\nYou just have to feed the response’s body into a `BeautifulSoup` object and extract whatever data you need from it.\n\nHere’s an example spider using BeautifulSoup API, with `lxml` as the HTML parser:\n\n```\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport scrapy\n\nclass ExampleSpider(scrapy.Spider):\n    name = \"example\"\n    allowed_domains = [\"example.com\"]\n    start_urls = (\"http://www.example.com/\",)\n\n    def parse(self, response):\n        # use lxml to get decent HTML parsing speed\n        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, \"lxml\")\n        yield {\"url\": response.url, \"title\": soup.h1.string}\n```\n\nNote\n\n`BeautifulSoup` supports several HTML/XML parsers.\nSee [BeautifulSoup’s official documentation](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#specifying-the-parser-to-use) on which ones are available.\n\n## Did Scrapy “steal” X from Django?\n\nProbably, but we don’t like that word. We think [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is a great open source project and an example to follow, so we’ve used it as an inspiration for Scrapy.\n\nWe believe that, if something is already done well, there’s no need to reinvent it. This concept, besides being one of the foundations for open source and free software, not only applies to software but also to documentation, procedures, policies, etc. So, instead of going through each problem ourselves, we choose to copy ideas from those projects that have already solved them properly, and focus on the real problems we need to solve.\n\nWe’d be proud if Scrapy serves as an inspiration for other projects. Feel free to steal from us!\n\n## Does Scrapy work with HTTP proxies?\n\nYes. Support for HTTP proxies is provided (since Scrapy 0.8) through the HTTP Proxy downloader middleware. See [`HttpProxyMiddleware`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpproxy.HttpProxyMiddleware \"scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpproxy.HttpProxyMiddleware\").\n\n## How can I scrape an item with attributes in different pages?\n\nSee [Passing additional data to callback functions](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/request-response.html#topics-request-response-ref-request-callback-arguments).\n\n## How can I simulate a user login in my spider?\n\nSee [Using FormRequest.from_response() to simulate a user login](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/request-response.html#topics-request-response-ref-request-userlogin).\n\n## Does Scrapy crawl in breadth-first or depth-first order?\n\nBy default, Scrapy uses a [LIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)) queue for storing pending requests, which basically means that it crawls in [DFO order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search). This order is more convenient in most cases.\n\nIf you do want to crawl in true [BFO order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search), you can do it by setting the following settings:\n\n```\nDEPTH_PRIORITY = 1\nSCHEDULER_DISK_QUEUE = \"scrapy.squeues.PickleFifoDiskQueue\"\nSCHEDULER_MEMORY_QUEUE = \"scrapy.squeues.FifoMemoryQueue\"\n```\n\nWhile pending requests are below the configured values of [`CONCURRENT_REQUESTS`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html#std-setting-CONCURRENT_REQUESTS), [`CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_DOMAIN`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html#std-setting-CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_DOMAIN) or [`CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_IP`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html#std-setting-CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_IP), those requests are sent concurrently. As a result, the first few requests of a crawl rarely follow the desired order. Lowering those settings to `1` enforces the desired order, but it significantly slows down the crawl as a whole.\n\n## My Scrapy crawler has memory leaks. What can I do?\n\nSee [Debugging memory leaks](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/leaks.html#topics-leaks).\n\nAlso, Python has a builtin memory leak issue which is described in [Leaks without leaks](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/leaks.html#topics-leaks-without-leaks).\n\n## How can I make Scrapy consume less memory?\n\nSee previous question.\n\n## How can I prevent memory errors due to many allowed domains?\n\nIf you have a spider with a long list of [`allowed_domains`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spiders.html#scrapy.Spider.allowed_domains \"scrapy.Spider.allowed_domains\") (e.g. 50,000+), consider replacing the default [`OffsiteMiddleware`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.offsite.OffsiteMiddleware \"scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.offsite.OffsiteMiddleware\") downloader middleware with a [custom downloader middleware](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#topics-downloader-middleware-custom) that requires less memory. For example:\n\n- If your domain names are similar enough, use your own regular expression instead joining the strings in [`allowed_domains`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spiders.html#scrapy.Spider.allowed_domains \"scrapy.Spider.allowed_domains\") into a complex regular expression.\n\n- If you can meet the installation requirements, use [pyre2](https://github.com/andreasvc/pyre2) instead of Python’s [re](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) to compile your URL-filtering regular expression. See [issue 1908](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/1908).\n\nSee also [other suggestions at StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/q/36440681).\n\nNote\n\nRemember to disable [`scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.offsite.OffsiteMiddleware`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.offsite.OffsiteMiddleware \"scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.offsite.OffsiteMiddleware\") when you enable your custom implementation:\n\n```\nDOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES = {\n    \"scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.offsite.OffsiteMiddleware\": None,\n    \"myproject.middlewares.CustomOffsiteMiddleware\": 50,\n}\n```\n\n## Can I use Basic HTTP Authentication in my spiders?\n\nYes, see [`HttpAuthMiddleware`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpauth.HttpAuthMiddleware \"scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpauth.HttpAuthMiddleware\").\n\n## Why does Scrapy download pages in English instead of my native language?\n\nTry changing the default [Accept-Language](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.4) request header by overriding the [`DEFAULT_REQUEST_HEADERS`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html#std-setting-DEFAULT_REQUEST_HEADERS) setting.\n\n## Where can I find some example Scrapy projects?\n\nSee [Examples](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/examples.html#intro-examples).\n\n## Can I run a spider without creating a project?\n\nYes. You can use the [`runspider`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/commands.html#std-command-runspider) command. For example, if you have a spider written in a `my_spider.py` file you can run it with:\n\n```\nscrapy runspider my_spider.py\n```\n\nSee [`runspider`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/commands.html#std-command-runspider) command for more info.\n\n## I get “Filtered offsite request” messages. How can I fix them?\n\nThose messages (logged with `DEBUG` level) don’t necessarily mean there is a problem, so you may not need to fix them.\n\nThose messages are thrown by [`OffsiteMiddleware`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.offsite.OffsiteMiddleware \"scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.offsite.OffsiteMiddleware\"), which is a downloader middleware (enabled by default) whose purpose is to filter out requests to domains outside the ones covered by the spider.\n\n## What is the recommended way to deploy a Scrapy crawler in production?\n\nSee [Deploying Spiders](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/deploy.html#topics-deploy).\n\n## Can I use JSON for large exports?\n\nIt’ll depend on how large your output is. See [this warning](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/exporters.html#json-with-large-data) in [`JsonItemExporter`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/exporters.html#scrapy.exporters.JsonItemExporter \"scrapy.exporters.JsonItemExporter\") documentation.\n\n## Can I return (Twisted) deferreds from signal handlers?\n\nSome signals support returning deferreds from their handlers, others don’t. See the [Built-in signals reference](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/signals.html#topics-signals-ref) to know which ones.\n\n## What does the response status code 999 mean?\n\n999 is a custom response status code used by Yahoo sites to throttle requests.\nTry slowing down the crawling speed by using a download delay of `2` (or higher) in your spider:\n\n```\nfrom scrapy.spiders import CrawlSpider\n\nclass MySpider(CrawlSpider):\n    name = \"myspider\"\n\n    download_delay = 2\n\n    # [ ... rest of the spider code ... ]\n```\n\nOr by setting a global download delay in your project with the [`DOWNLOAD_DELAY`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html#std-setting-DOWNLOAD_DELAY) setting.\n\n## Can I call `pdb.set_trace()` from my spiders to debug them?\n\nYes, but you can also use the Scrapy shell which allows you to quickly analyze (and even modify) the response being processed by your spider, which is, quite often, more useful than plain old `pdb.set_trace()`.\n\nFor more info see [Invoking the shell from spiders to inspect responses](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/shell.html#topics-shell-inspect-response).\n\n## Simplest way to dump all my scraped items into a JSON/CSV/XML file?\n\nTo dump into a JSON file:\n\n```\nscrapy crawl myspider -O items.json\n```\n\nTo dump into a CSV file:\n\n```\nscrapy crawl myspider -O items.csv\n```\n\nTo dump into an XML file:\n\n```\nscrapy crawl myspider -O items.xml\n```\n\nFor more information see [Feed exports](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/feed-exports.html#topics-feed-exports)\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/faq.html", "title": "Frequently Asked Questions", "description": "This page contains frequently asked questions about Scrapy, covering various topics related to its usage, features, and best practices.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 21, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 04:30:35", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "readthedocs-project-slug": "scrapy", "generator": "Docutils 0.19: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/", "title": "Frequently Asked Questions — Scrapy 2.12.0 documentation", "readthedocs-version-slug": "latest", "readthedocs-http-status": "200", "language": "en", "readthedocs-resolver-filename": "/faq.html", "scrapeId": "99c05b1c-d539-45d8-b4fd-471f5c13488d", "sourceURL": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/faq.html", "url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/faq.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Scrapy shell is in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Scrapy shell in scrapy-latest.\n\n# Scrapy shell\n\nThe Scrapy shell is an interactive shell where you can try and debug your scraping code very quickly, without having to run the spider. It’s meant to be used for testing data extraction code, but you can actually use it for testing any kind of code as it is also a regular Python shell.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Configuring the shell\n\nIf you have [IPython](https://ipython.org/) installed, the Scrapy shell will use it (instead of the standard Python console). The [IPython](https://ipython.org/) console is much more powerful and provides smart auto-completion and colorized output, among other things.\n\nWe highly recommend you install [IPython](https://ipython.org/), specially if you’re working on Unix systems (where [IPython](https://ipython.org/) excels). See the [IPython installation guide](https://ipython.org/install.html) for more info.\n\nScrapy also has support for [bpython](https://bpython-interpreter.org/), and will try to use it where [IPython](https://ipython.org/) is unavailable.\n\nThrough Scrapy’s settings you can configure it to use any one of `ipython`, `bpython` or the standard `python` shell, regardless of which are installed. This is done by setting the `SCRAPY_PYTHON_SHELL` environment variable; or by defining it in your [scrapy.cfg](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/commands.html#topics-config-settings):\n\n```\n[settings]\nshell = bpython\n``\n\n## Launch the shell\n\nTo launch the Scrapy shell you can use the [`shell`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/commands.html#std-command-shell) command like this:\n\n```\nscrapy shell <url>\n```\n\nWhere the `<url>` is the URL you want to scrape.\n\n[`shell`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/commands.html#std-command-shell) also works for local files. This can be handy if you want to play around with a local copy of a web page. [`shell`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/commands.html#std-command-shell) understands the following syntaxes for local files:\n\n```\n# UNIX-style\nscrapy shell ./path/to/file.html\nscrapy shell ../other/path/to/file.html\nscrapy shell /absolute/path/to/file.html\n\n# File URI\nscrapy shell file:///absolute/path/to/file.html\n```\n\nNote\n\nWhen using relative file paths, be explicit and prepend them with `./` (or `../` when relevant).\n`scrapy shell index.html` will not work as one might expect (and this is by design, not a bug).\n\nBecause [`shell`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/commands.html#std-command-shell) favors HTTP URLs over File URIs, and `index.html` being syntactically similar to `example.com`, [`shell`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/commands.html#std-command-shell) will treat `index.html` as a domain name and trigger a DNS lookup error:\n\n```\n$ scrapy shell index.html\n[ ... scrapy shell starts ... ]\n[ ... traceback ... ]\ntwisted.internet.error.DNSLookupError: DNS lookup failed:\naddress 'index.html' not found: [Errno -5] No address associated with hostname.\n```\n\n[`shell`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/commands.html#std-command-shell) will not test beforehand if a file called `index.html` exists in the current directory. Again, be explicit.\n\n## Using the shell\n\nThe Scrapy shell is just a regular Python console (or [IPython](https://ipython.org/) console if you have it available) which provides some additional shortcut functions for convenience.\n\n### Available Shortcuts\n\n- `shelp()` \\- print a help with the list of available objects and shortcuts\n\n- `fetch(url[, redirect=True])` \\- fetch a new response from the given URL and update all related objects accordingly.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: How do I configuring the shell in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: To configuring the shell in scrapy-latest, here's what you do:\nIf you have [IPython](https://ipython.org/) installed, the Scrapy shell will use it (instead of the standard Python console). The [IPython](https://ipython.org/) console is much more powerful and provides smart auto-completion and colorized output, among other things.\n\nWe highly recommend you install [IPython](https://ipython.org/), specially if you’re working on Unix systems (where [IPython](https://ipython.org/) excels). See the [IPython installation guide](https://ipython.org/install.html) for more info.\n\nScrapy also has support for [bpython](https://bpython-interpreter.org/), and will try to use it where [IPython](https://ipython.org/) is unavailable.\n\nThrough Scrapy’s settings you can configure it to use any one of `ipython`, `bpython` or the standard `python` shell, regardless of which are installed.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Item Loaders is in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Item Loaders in scrapy-latest.\n\n# Item Loaders\n\nItem Loaders provide a convenient mechanism for populating scraped items. Even though items can be populated directly, Item Loaders provide a much more convenient API for populating them from a scraping process, by automating some common tasks like parsing the raw extracted data before assigning it.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Using Item Loaders to populate items\n\nTo use an Item Loader, you must first instantiate it. You can either instantiate it with an item object or without one, in which case an item object is automatically created in the Item Loader `__init__` method using the item class specified in the `ItemLoader.default_item_class` attribute.\n\nThen, you start collecting values into the Item Loader, typically using Selectors. You can add more than one value to the same item field; the Item Loader will know how to “join” those values later using a proper processing function.\n\nCollected data is internally stored as lists, allowing to add several values to the same field. If an `item` argument is passed when creating a loader, each of the item’s values will be stored as-is if it’s already an iterable, or wrapped with a list if it’s a single value.\n\nHere is a typical Item Loader usage in a Spider, using the Product item declared in the Items chapter:\n\n```python\nfrom scrapy.loader import ItemLoader\nfrom myproject.items import Product\n\ndef parse(self, response):\n    l = ItemLoader(item=Product(), response=response)\n    l.add_xpath(\"name\", '//div[@class=\"product_name\"]')\n    l.add_xpath(\"name\", '//div[@class=\"product_title\"]')\n    l.add_xpath(\"price\", '//p[@id=\"price\"]')\n    l.add_css(\"stock\", \"p#stock\")\n    l.add_value(\"last_updated\", \"today\")  # you can also use literal values\n    return l.load_item()\n```\n\nBy quickly looking at that code, we can see the `name` field is being extracted from two different XPath locations in the page:\n\n1. `//div[@class=\"product_name\"]`\n2. `//div[@class=\"product_title\"]`\n\nIn other words, data is being collected by extracting it from two XPath locations, using the `add_xpath()` method. This is the data that will be assigned to the `name` field later.\n\nAfterwards, similar calls are used for `price` and `stock` fields (the latter using a CSS selector with the `add_css()` method), and finally the `last_update` field is populated directly with a literal value ( `today`) using a different method: `add_value()`.\n\nFinally, when all data is collected, the `ItemLoader.load_item()` method is called which actually returns the item populated with the data previously extracted and collected with the `add_xpath()`, `add_css()`, and `add_value()` calls.\n\n## Working with dataclass items\n\nBy default, dataclass items require all fields to be passed when created. This could be an issue when using dataclass items with item loaders: unless a pre-populated item is passed to the loader, fields will be populated incrementally using the loader’s `add_xpath()`, `add_css()` and `add_value()` methods.\n\nOne approach to overcome this is to define items using the `field()` function, with a `default` argument:\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\nfrom typing import Optional\n\ndataclass\nclass InventoryItem:\n    name: Optional[str] = field(default=None)\n    price: Optional[float] = field(default=None)\n    stock: Optional[int] = field(default=None)\n```\n\n## Input and Output processors\n\nAn Item Loader contains one input processor and one output processor for each (item) field. The input processor processes the extracted data as soon as it’s received (through the `add_xpath()`, `add_css()` or `add_value()` methods) and the result of the input processor is collected and kept inside the ItemLoader. After collecting all data, the `ItemLoader.load_item()` method is called to populate and get the populated item. That’s when the output processor is called with the data previously collected (and processed using the input processor). The result of the output processor is the final value that gets assigned to the item.\n\nLet’s see an example to illustrate how the input and output processors are called for a particular field (the same applies for any other field):\n\n```python\nl = ItemLoader(Product(), some_selector)\nl.add_xpath(\"name\", xpath1)  # (1)\nl.add_xpath(\"name\", xpath2)  # (2)\nl.add_css(\"name\", css)  # (3)\nl.add_value(\"name\", \"test\")  # (4)\nreturn l.load_item()  # (5)\n```\n\nSo what happens is:\n\n1. Data from `xpath1` is extracted, and passed through the _input processor_ of the `name` field. The result of the input processor is collected and kept in the Item Loader (but not yet assigned to the item).\n2. Data from `xpath2` is extracted, and passed through the same _input_ processor used in (1). The result of the input processor is appended to the data collected in (1) (if any).\n3. This case is similar to the previous ones, except that the data is extracted from the `css` CSS selector, and passed through the same _input_ processor used in (1) and (2). The result of the input processor is appended to the data collected in (1) and (2) (if any).\n4. This case is also similar to the previous ones, except that the value to be collected is assigned directly, instead of being extracted from a XPath expression or a CSS selector. However, the value is still passed through the input processors. In this case, since the value is not iterable it is converted to an iterable of a single element before passing it to the input processor, because input processor always receive iterables.\n5. The data collected in steps (1), (2), (3) and (4) is passed through the _output processor_ of the `name` field. The result of the output processor is the value assigned to the `name` field in the item.\n\nIt’s worth noticing that processors are just callable objects, which are called with the data to be parsed, and return a parsed value. So you can use any function as input or output processor. The only requirement is that they must accept one (and only one) positional argument, which will be an iterable.\n\n## Declaring Item Loaders\n\nItem Loaders are declared using a class definition syntax. Here is an example:\n\n```python\nfrom itemloaders.processors import TakeFirst, MapCompose, Join\nfrom scrapy.loader import ItemLoader\n\nclass ProductLoader(ItemLoader):\n    default_output_processor = TakeFirst()\n\n    name_in = MapCompose(str.title)\n    name_out = Join()\n\n    price_in = MapCompose(str.strip)\n    # ...\n```\n\n## Nested Loaders\n\nWhen parsing related values from a subsection of a document, it can be useful to create nested loaders. Imagine you’re extracting details from a footer of a page that looks something like:\n\nExample:\n\n```html\n<footer>\n    <a class=\"social\" href=\"https://facebook.com/whatever\">Like Us</a>\n    <a class=\"social\" href=\"https://twitter.com/whatever\">Follow Us</a>\n    <a class=\"email\" href=\"mailto:whatever@example.com\">Email Us</a>\n</footer>\n```\n\nWithout nested loaders, you need to specify the full xpath (or css) for each value that you wish to extract.\n\nExample:\n\n```python\nloader = ItemLoader(item=Item())\n# load stuff not in the footer\nloader.add_xpath(\"social\", '//footer/a[@class = \"social\"]/@href')\nloader.add_xpath(\"email\", '//footer/a[@class = \"email\"]/@href')\nloader.load_item()\n```\n\nInstead, you can create a nested loader with the footer selector and add values relative to the footer. The functionality is the same but you avoid repeating the footer selector.\n\nExample:\n\n```python\nloader = ItemLoader(item=Item())\n# load stuff not in the footer\nfooter_loader = loader.nested_xpath(\"//footer\")\nfooter_loader.add_xpath(\"social\", 'a[@class = \"social\"]/@href')\nfooter_loader.add_xpath(\"email\", 'a[@class = \"email\"]/@href')\n# no need to call footer_loader.load_item()\nloader.load_item()\n```\n\nYou can nest loaders arbitrarily and they work with either xpath or css selectors. As a general guideline, use nested loaders when they make your code simpler but do not go overboard with nesting or your parser can become difficult to read.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/loaders.html", "title": "Item Loaders", "description": "Item Loaders provide a convenient mechanism for populating scraped items.

This is the data that will be assigned to the `name` field later.\n\nAfterwards, similar calls are used for `price` and `stock` fields (the latter using a CSS selector with the `add_css()` method), and finally the `last_update` field is populated directly with a literal value ( `today`) using a different method: `add_value()`.\n\nFinally, when all data is collected, the `ItemLoader.load_item()` method is called which actually returns the item populated with the data previously extracted and collected with the `add_xpath()`, `add_css()`, and `add_value()` calls..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/loaders.html", "title": "Item Loaders", "description": "Item Loaders provide a convenient mechanism for populating scraped items.

This could be an issue when using dataclass items with item loaders: unless a pre-populated item is passed to the loader, fields will be populated incrementally using the loader’s `add_xpath()`, `add_css()` and `add_value()` methods.\n\nOne approach to overcome this is to define items using the `field()` function, with a `default` argument:\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\nfrom typing import Optional\n\ndataclass\nclass InventoryItem:\n    name: Optional[str] = field(default=None)\n    price: Optional[float] = field(default=None)\n    stock: Optional[int] = field(default=None)\n```.\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/loaders.html", "title": "Item Loaders", "description": "Item Loaders provide a convenient mechanism for populating scraped items.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: How do I input and output processors in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: To input and output processors in scrapy-latest, here's what you do:\nAn Item Loader contains one input processor and one output processor for each (item) field. The input processor processes the extracted data as soon as it’s received (through the `add_xpath()`, `add_css()` or `add_value()` methods) and the result of the input processor is collected and kept inside the ItemLoader. After collecting all data, the `ItemLoader.load_item()` method is called to populate and get the populated item. That’s when the output processor is called with the data previously collected (and processed using the input processor). The result of the output processor is the final value that gets assigned to the item.\n\nLet’s see an example to illustrate how the input and output processors are called for a particular field (the same applies for any other field):\n\n```python\nl = ItemLoader(Product(), some_selector)\nl.add_xpath(\"name\", xpath1)  # (1)\nl.add_xpath(\"name\", xpath2)  # (2)\nl.add_css(\"name\", css)  # (3)\nl.add_value(\"name\", \"test\")  # (4)\nreturn l.load_item()  # (5)\n```\n\nSo what happens is:\n\n1. Data from `xpath1` is extracted, and passed through the _input processor_ of the `name` field. The result of the input processor is collected and kept in the Item Loader (but not yet assigned to the item).\n2. Data from `xpath2` is extracted, and passed through the same _input_ processor used in (1). The result of the input processor is appended to the data collected in (1) (if any).\n3. This case is similar to the previous ones, except that the data is extracted from the `css` CSS selector, and passed through the same _input_ processor used in (1) and (2). The result of the input processor is appended to the data collected in (1) and (2) (if any).\n4. This case is also similar to the previous ones, except that the value to be collected is assigned directly, instead of being extracted from a XPath expression or a CSS selector. However, the value is still passed through the input processors. In this case, since the value is not iterable it is converted to an iterable of a single element before passing it to the input processor, because input processor always receive iterables.\n5. The data collected in steps (1), (2), (3) and (4) is passed through the _output processor_ of the `name` field. The result of the output processor is the value assigned to the `name` field in the item.\n\nIt’s worth noticing that processors are just callable objects, which are called with the data to be parsed, and return a parsed value. So you can use any function as input or output processor. The only requirement is that they must accept one (and only one) positional argument, which will be an iterable..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/loaders.html", "title": "Item Loaders", "description": "Item Loaders provide a convenient mechanism for populating scraped items.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: How do I nested loaders in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: To nested loaders in scrapy-latest, here's what you do:\nWhen parsing related values from a subsection of a document, it can be useful to create nested loaders. Imagine you’re extracting details from a footer of a page that looks something like:\n\nExample:\n\n```html\n<footer>\n    <a class=\"social\" href=\"https://facebook.com/whatever\">Like Us</a>\n    <a class=\"social\" href=\"https://twitter.com/whatever\">Follow Us</a>\n    <a class=\"email\" href=\"mailto:whatever@example.com\">Email Us</a>\n</footer>\n```\n\nWithout nested loaders, you need to specify the full xpath (or css) for each value that you wish to extract.\n\nExample:\n\n```python\nloader = ItemLoader(item=Item())\n# load stuff not in the footer\nloader.add_xpath(\"social\", '//footer/a[@class = \"social\"]/@href')\nloader.add_xpath(\"email\", '//footer/a[@class = \"email\"]/@href')\nloader.load_item()\n```\n\nInstead, you can create a nested loader with the footer selector and add values relative to the footer. The functionality is the same but you avoid repeating the footer selector.\n\nExample:\n\n```python\nloader = ItemLoader(item=Item())\n# load stuff not in the footer\nfooter_loader = loader.nested_xpath(\"//footer\")\nfooter_loader.add_xpath(\"social\", 'a[@class = \"social\"]/@href')\nfooter_loader.add_xpath(\"email\", 'a[@class = \"email\"]/@href')\n# no need to call footer_loader.load_item()\nloader.load_item()\n```\n\nYou can nest loaders arbitrarily and they work with either xpath or css selectors. As a general guideline, use nested loaders when they make your code simpler but do not go overboard with nesting or your parser can become difficult to read..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/loaders.html", "title": "Item Loaders", "description": "Item Loaders provide a convenient mechanism for populating scraped items.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Debugging Spiders is in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Debugging Spiders in scrapy-latest.\n\n# Debugging Spiders\n\nThis document explains the most common techniques for debugging spiders.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Debugging Spiders\n\nThis document explains the most common techniques for debugging spiders. Consider the following Scrapy spider below:\n\n```python\nimport scrapy\nfrom myproject.items import MyItem\n\nclass MySpider(scrapy.Spider):\n    name = \"myspider\"\n    start_urls = (\n        \"http://example.com/page1\",\n        \"http://example.com/page2\",\n    )\n\n    def parse(self, response):\n        # <processing code not shown>\n        # collect `item_urls`\n        for item_url in item_urls:\n            yield scrapy.Request(item_url, self.parse_item)\n\n    def parse_item(self, response):\n        # <processing code not shown>\n        item = MyItem()\n        # populate `item` fields\n        # and extract item_details_url\n        yield scrapy.Request(\n            item_details_url, self.parse_details, cb_kwargs={\"item\": item}\n        )\n\n    def parse_details(self, response, item):\n        # populate more `item` fields\n        return item\n```\n\nBasically this is a simple spider which parses two pages of items (the start_urls). Items also have a details page with additional information, so we use the `cb_kwargs` functionality of `Request` to pass a partially populated item.\n\n## Parse Command\n\nThe most basic way of checking the output of your spider is to use the [`parse`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/commands.html#std-command-parse) command. It allows to check the behaviour of different parts of the spider at the method level. It has the advantage of being flexible and simple to use, but does not allow debugging code inside a method.\n\nIn order to see the item scraped from a specific url:\n\n```\n$ scrapy parse --spider=myspider -c parse_item -d 2 <item_url>\n[ ... scrapy log lines crawling example.com spider ... ]\n\n>>> STATUS DEPTH LEVEL 2 <<<\n# Scraped Items  ------------------------------------------------------------\n[{'url': <item_url>}]\n\n# Requests  -----------------------------------------------------------------\n[]\n```\n\nUsing the `--verbose` or `-v` option we can see the status at each depth level:\n\n```\n$ scrapy parse --spider=myspider -c parse_item -d 2 -v <item_url>\n[ ... scrapy log lines crawling example.com spider ... ]\n\n>>> DEPTH LEVEL: 1 <<<\n# Scraped Items  ------------------------------------------------------------\n[]\n\n# Requests  -----------------------------------------------------------------\n[<GET item_details_url>]\n\n>>> DEPTH LEVEL: 2 <<<\n# Scraped Items  ------------------------------------------------------------\n[{'url': <item_url>}]\n\n# Requests  -----------------------------------------------------------------\n[]\n```\n\nChecking items scraped from a single start_url, can also be easily achieved using:\n\n```\n$ scrapy parse --spider=myspider -d 3 'http://example.com/page1'\n```\n\n## Scrapy Shell\n\nWhile the [`parse`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/commands.html#std-command-parse) command is very useful for checking behaviour of a spider, it is of little help to check what happens inside a callback, besides showing the response received and the output. How to debug the situation when `parse_details` sometimes receives no item?\n\nFortunately, the [`shell`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/commands.html#std-command-shell) is your bread and butter in this case (see [Invoking the shell from spiders to inspect responses](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/shell.html#topics-shell-inspect-response)):\n\n```\nfrom scrapy.shell import inspect_response\n\ndef parse_details(self, response, item=None):\n    if item:\n        # populate more `item` fields\n        return item\n    else:\n        inspect_response(response, self)\n```\n\n## Open in browser\n\nSometimes you just want to see how a certain response looks in a browser, you can use the [`open_in_browser()`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/debug.html#scrapy.utils.response.open_in_browser) function for that:\n\n```python\nscrapy.utils.response.open_in_browser( _response:TextResponse,_openfunc:Callable[[str],Any]=<function open>)\n```\n\nOpen _response_ in a local web browser, adjusting the [base tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_base.asp) for external links to work, e.g. so that images and styles are displayed.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nfrom scrapy.utils.response import open_in_browser\n\ndef parse_details(self, response):\n    if \"item name\" not in response.body:\n        open_in_browser(response)\n```\n\n## Logging\n\nLogging is another useful option for getting information about your spider run.

Consider the following Scrapy spider below:\n\n```python\nimport scrapy\nfrom myproject.items import MyItem\n\nclass MySpider(scrapy.Spider):\n    name = \"myspider\"\n    start_urls = (\n        \"http://example.com/page1\",\n        \"http://example.com/page2\",\n    )\n\n    def parse(self, response):\n        # <processing code not shown>\n        # collect `item_urls`\n        for item_url in item_urls:\n            yield scrapy.Request(item_url, self.parse_item)\n\n    def parse_item(self, response):\n        # <processing code not shown>\n        item = MyItem()\n        # populate `item` fields\n        # and extract item_details_url\n        yield scrapy.Request(\n            item_details_url, self.parse_details, cb_kwargs={\"item\": item}\n        )\n\n    def parse_details(self, response, item):\n        # populate more `item` fields\n        return item\n```\n\nBasically this is a simple spider which parses two pages of items (the start_urls). Items also have a details page with additional information, so we use the `cb_kwargs` functionality of `Request` to pass a partially populated item..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/debug.html", "title": "Debugging Spiders", "description": "This document explains the most common techniques for debugging spiders.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": false, "section_count": 6, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 04:37:03", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"readthedocs-version-slug": "latest", "title": "Debugging Spiders — Scrapy 2.12.0 documentation", "readthedocs-project-slug": "scrapy", "readthedocs-http-status": "200", "readthedocs-resolver-filename": "/topics/debug.html", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "language": "en", "generator": "Docutils 0.19: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/", "scrapeId": "538545cd-fd7a-4675-b030-bc3817fb69a0", "sourceURL": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/debug.html", "url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/debug.html", "statusCode": 200}}}
{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: How do I parse command in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: To parse command in scrapy-latest, here's what you do:\nThe most basic way of checking the output of your spider is to use the [`parse`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/commands.html#std-command-parse) command. It allows to check the behaviour of different parts of the spider at the method level. It has the advantage of being flexible and simple to use, but does not allow debugging code inside a method.\n\nIn order to see the item scraped from a specific url:\n\n```\n$ scrapy parse --spider=myspider -c parse_item -d 2 <item_url>\n[ ... scrapy log lines crawling example.com spider ... ]\n\n>>> STATUS DEPTH LEVEL 2 <<<\n# Scraped Items  ------------------------------------------------------------\n[{'url': <item_url>}]\n\n# Requests  -----------------------------------------------------------------\n[]\n```\n\nUsing the `--verbose` or `-v` option we can see the status at each depth level:\n\n```\n$ scrapy parse --spider=myspider -c parse_item -d 2 -v <item_url>\n[ ... scrapy log lines crawling example.com spider ... ]\n\n>>> DEPTH LEVEL: 1 <<<\n# Scraped Items  ------------------------------------------------------------\n[]\n\n# Requests  -----------------------------------------------------------------\n[<GET item_details_url>]\n\n>>> DEPTH LEVEL: 2 <<<\n# Scraped Items  ------------------------------------------------------------\n[{'url': <item_url>}]\n\n# Requests  -----------------------------------------------------------------\n[]\n```\n\nChecking items scraped from a single start_url, can also be easily achieved using:\n\n```\n$ scrapy parse --spider=myspider -d 3 'http://example.com/page1'\n```.\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/debug.html", "title": "Debugging Spiders", "description": "This document explains the most common techniques for debugging spiders.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": false, "section_count": 6, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 04:37:03", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"readthedocs-version-slug": "latest", "title": "Debugging Spiders — Scrapy 2.12.0 documentation", "readthedocs-project-slug": "scrapy", "readthedocs-http-status": "200", "readthedocs-resolver-filename": "/topics/debug.html", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "language": "en", "generator": "Docutils 0.19: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/", "scrapeId": "538545cd-fd7a-4675-b030-bc3817fb69a0", "sourceURL": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/debug.html", "url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/debug.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Coroutines is in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Coroutines in scrapy-latest.\n\n# Coroutines\n\nScrapy has partial support for the coroutine syntax, allowing for cleaner and shorter code when using asynchronous programming in Scrapy.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Supported callables\n\nThe following callables may be defined as coroutines using `async def`, and hence use coroutine syntax (e.g. `await`, `async for`, `async with`):\n\n- `Request` callbacks.\n\nIf you are using any custom or third-party spider middleware, see Mixing synchronous and asynchronous spider middlewares.\n\nChanged in version 2.7: Output of async callbacks is now processed asynchronously instead of collecting all of it first.\n\n- The `process_item()` method of item pipelines.\n\n- The `process_request()`, `process_response()`, and `process_exception()` methods of downloader middlewares.\n\n- Signal handlers that support deferreds.\n\n- The `process_spider_output()` method of spider middlewares.\n\nIt must be defined as an asynchronous generator. The input `result` parameter is an asynchronous iterable.\n\n## General usage\n\nThere are several use cases for coroutines in Scrapy.\n\nCode that would return Deferreds when written for previous Scrapy versions, such as downloader middlewares and signal handlers, can be rewritten to be shorter and cleaner:\n\n```python\nfrom itemadapter import ItemAdapter\n\nclass DbPipeline:\n    def _update_item(self, data, item):\n        adapter = ItemAdapter(item)\n        adapter[\"field\"] = data\n        return item\n\n    def process_item(self, item, spider):\n        adapter = ItemAdapter(item)\n        dfd = db.get_some_data(adapter[\"id\"])\n        dfd.addCallback(self._update_item, item)\n        return dfd\n```\n\nbecomes:\n\n```python\nfrom itemadapter import ItemAdapter\n\nclass DbPipeline:\n    async def process_item(self, item, spider):\n        adapter = ItemAdapter(item)\n        adapter[\"field\"] = await db.get_some_data(adapter[\"id\"])\n        return item\n```\n\nCoroutines may be used to call asynchronous code. This includes other coroutines, functions that return Deferreds and functions that return awaitable objects such as `Future`.\n\nCommon use cases for asynchronous code include:\n- requesting data from websites, databases and other services (in callbacks, pipelines and middlewares);\n- storing data in databases (in pipelines and middlewares);\n- delaying the spider initialization until some external event (in the `spider_opened` handler);\n- calling asynchronous Scrapy methods like `ExecutionEngine.download()`.\n\n## Inline requests\n\nThe spider below shows how to send a request and await its response all from within a spider callback:\n\n```python\nfrom scrapy import Spider, Request\nfrom scrapy.utils.defer import maybe_deferred_to_future\n\nclass SingleRequestSpider(Spider):\n    name = \"single\"\n    start_urls = [\"https://example.org/product\"]\n\n    async def parse(self, response, **kwargs):\n        additional_request = Request(\"https://example.org/price\")\n        deferred = self.crawler.engine.download(additional_request)\n        additional_response = await maybe_deferred_to_future(deferred)\n        yield {\n            \"h1\": response.css(\"h1\").get(),\n            \"price\": additional_response.css(\"#price\").get(),\n        }\n```\n\nYou can also send multiple requests in parallel:\n\n```python\nfrom scrapy import Spider, Request\nfrom scrapy.utils.defer import maybe_deferred_to_future\nfrom twisted.internet.defer import DeferredList\n\nclass MultipleRequestsSpider(Spider):\n    name = \"multiple\"\n    start_urls = [\"https://example.com/product\"]\n\n    async def parse(self, response, **kwargs):\n        additional_requests = [\n            Request(\"https://example.com/price\"),\n            Request(\"https://example.com/color\"),\n        ]\n        deferreds = []\n        for r in additional_requests:\n            deferred = self.crawler.engine.download(r)\n            deferreds.append(deferred)\n        responses = await maybe_deferred_to_future(DeferredList(deferreds))\n        yield {\n            \"h1\": response.css(\"h1::text\").get(),\n            \"price\": responses[0][1].css(\".price::text\").get(),\n            \"price2\": responses[1][1].css(\".color::text\").get(),\n        }\n```\n\n## Mixing synchronous and asynchronous spider middlewares\n\nThe output of a `Request` callback is passed as the `result` parameter to the `process_spider_output()` method of the first spider middleware from the list of active spider middlewares. Scrapy supports mixing coroutine methods and synchronous methods in this chain of calls.\n\nHowever, if any of the `process_spider_output` methods is defined as a synchronous method, and the previous `Request` callback or `process_spider_output` method is a coroutine, there are some drawbacks to the asynchronous-to-synchronous conversion that Scrapy does so that the synchronous `process_spider_output` method gets a synchronous iterable as its `result` parameter.\n\n## Universal spider middlewares\n\nTo allow writing a spider middleware that supports asynchronous execution of its `process_spider_output` method in Scrapy 2.7 and later while maintaining support for older Scrapy versions, you may define `process_spider_output` as a synchronous method and define an asynchronous generator version of that method with an alternative name: `process_spider_output_async`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\nclass UniversalSpiderMiddleware:\n    def process_spider_output(self, response, result, spider):\n        for r in result:\n            yield r\n\n    async def process_spider_output_async(self, response, result, spider):\n        async for r in result:\n            yield r\n```\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/coroutines.html", "title": "Coroutines", "description": "Scrapy has partial support for the coroutine syntax, allowing for cleaner and shorter code when using asynchronous programming in Scrapy.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 5, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 04:41:43", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"generator": "Docutils 0.19: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "language": "en", "readthedocs-version-slug": "latest", "readthedocs-resolver-filename": "/topics/coroutines.html", "readthedocs-project-slug": "scrapy", "readthedocs-http-status": "200", "title": "Coroutines — Scrapy 2.12.0 documentation", "scrapeId": "27ff67fa-f9b1-417f-bd7b-81a33f02a0eb", "sourceURL": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/coroutines.html", "url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/coroutines.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

This includes other coroutines, functions that return Deferreds and functions that return awaitable objects such as `Future`.\n\nCommon use cases for asynchronous code include:\n- requesting data from websites, databases and other services (in callbacks, pipelines and middlewares);\n- storing data in databases (in pipelines and middlewares);\n- delaying the spider initialization until some external event (in the `spider_opened` handler);\n- calling asynchronous Scrapy methods like `ExecutionEngine.download()`..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/coroutines.html", "title": "Coroutines", "description": "Scrapy has partial support for the coroutine syntax, allowing for cleaner and shorter code when using asynchronous programming in Scrapy.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 5, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 04:41:43", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"generator": "Docutils 0.19: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "language": "en", "readthedocs-version-slug": "latest", "readthedocs-resolver-filename": "/topics/coroutines.html", "readthedocs-project-slug": "scrapy", "readthedocs-http-status": "200", "title": "Coroutines — Scrapy 2.12.0 documentation", "scrapeId": "27ff67fa-f9b1-417f-bd7b-81a33f02a0eb", "sourceURL": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/coroutines.html", "url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/coroutines.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Downloader Middleware is in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Downloader Middleware in scrapy-latest.\n\n# Downloader Middleware\n\nThe downloader middleware is a framework of hooks into Scrapy’s request/response processing. It’s a light, low-level system for globally altering Scrapy’s requests and responses.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Activating a downloader middleware\n\nTo activate a downloader middleware component, add it to the `DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES` setting, which is a dict whose keys are the middleware class paths and their values are the middleware orders.\n\nHere’s an example:\n\n```\nDOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES = {\n    \"myproject.middlewares.CustomDownloaderMiddleware\": 543,\n}\n```\n\nThe `DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES` setting is merged with the `DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES_BASE` setting defined in Scrapy (and not meant to be overridden) and then sorted by order to get the final sorted list of enabled middlewares: the first middleware is the one closer to the engine and the last is the one closer to the downloader. In other words, the `process_request()` method of each middleware will be invoked in increasing middleware order (100, 200, 300, …) and the `process_response()` method of each middleware will be invoked in decreasing order.\n\nTo decide which order to assign to your middleware see the `DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES_BASE` setting and pick a value according to where you want to insert the middleware. The order does matter because each middleware performs a different action and your middleware could depend on some previous (or subsequent) middleware being applied.\n\nIf you want to disable a built-in middleware (the ones defined in `DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES_BASE` and enabled by default) you must define it in your project’s `DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES` setting and assign `None` as its value. For example, if you want to disable the user-agent middleware:\n\n```\nDOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES = {\n    \"myproject.middlewares.CustomDownloaderMiddleware\": 543,\n    \"scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.useragent.UserAgentMiddleware\": None,\n}\n```\n\nFinally, keep in mind that some middlewares may need to be enabled through a particular setting. See each middleware documentation for more info.\n\n## Writing your own downloader middleware\n\nEach downloader middleware is a Python class that defines one or more of the methods defined below.\n\nThe main entry point is the `from_crawler` class method, which receives a `Crawler` instance. The `Crawler` object gives you access, for example, to the settings.\n\n_class_ scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.DownloaderMiddleware\n\nNote\n\nAny of the downloader middleware methods may also return a deferred.\n\nprocess_request( _request_, _spider_)\n\nThis method is called for each request that goes through the download middleware.\n\n`process_request()` should either: return `None`, return a `Response` object, return a `Request` object, or raise `IgnoreRequest`.\n\nIf it returns `None`, Scrapy will continue processing this request, executing all other middlewares until, finally, the appropriate downloader handler is called the request performed (and its response downloaded).\n\nIf it returns a `Response` object, Scrapy won’t bother calling _any_ other `process_request()` or `process_exception()` methods, or the appropriate download function; it’ll return that response. The `process_response()` methods of installed middleware is always called on every response.\n\nIf it returns a `Request` object, Scrapy will stop calling `process_request()` methods and reschedule the returned request. Once the newly returned request is performed, the appropriate middleware chain will be called on the downloaded response.\n\nIf it raises an `IgnoreRequest` exception, the `process_exception()` methods of installed downloader middleware will be called. If none of them handle the exception, the errback function of the request ( `Request.errback`) is called. If no code handles the raised exception, it is ignored and not logged (unlike other exceptions).\n\nParameters:\n\n- **request** ( `Request` object) – the request being processed\n\n- **spider** ( `Spider` object) – the spider for which this request is intended\n\nprocess_response( _request_, _response_, _spider_)\n\n`process_response()` should either: return a `Response` object, return a `Request` object or raise a `IgnoreRequest` exception.\n\nIf it returns a `Response` (it could be the same given response, or a brand-new one), that response will continue to be processed with the `process_response()` of the next middleware in the chain.\n\nIf it returns a `Request` object, the middleware chain is halted and the returned request is rescheduled to be downloaded in the future. This is the same behavior as if a request is returned from `process_request()`.\n\nIf it raises an `IgnoreRequest` exception, the errback function of the request ( `Request.errback`) is called. If no code handles the raised exception, it is ignored and not logged (unlike other exceptions).\n\nParameters:\n\n- **request** (is a `Request` object) – the request that originated the response\n\n- **response** ( `Response` object) – the response being processed\n\n- **spider** ( `Spider` object) – the spider for which this response is intended\n\nprocess_exception( _request_, _exception_, _spider_)\n\nScrapy calls `process_exception()` when a download handler or a `process_request()` (from a downloader middleware) raises an exception (including an `IgnoreRequest` exception)\n\n`process_exception()` should return: either `None`, a `Response` object, or a `Request` object.\n\nIf it returns `None`, Scrapy will continue processing this exception, executing any other `process_exception()` methods of installed middleware, until no middleware is left and the default exception handling kicks in.\n\nIf it returns a `Response` object, the `process_response()` method chain of installed middleware is started, and Scrapy won’t bother calling any other `process_exception()` methods of middleware.\n\nIf it returns a `Request` object, the returned request is rescheduled to be downloaded in the future. This stops the execution of `process_exception()` methods of the middleware the same as returning a response would.\n\nParameters:\n\n- **request** (is a `Request` object) – the request that generated the exception\n\n- **exception** (an `Exception` object) – the raised exception\n\n- **spider** ( `Spider` object) – the spider for which this request is intended\n\nfrom_crawler( _cls_, _crawler_)\n\nIf present, this classmethod is called to create a middleware instance from a `Crawler`. It must return a new instance of the middleware. Crawler object provides access to all Scrapy core components like settings and signals; it is a way for middleware to access them and hook its functionality into Scrapy.\n\nParameters:\n\n**crawler** ( `Crawler` object) – crawler that uses this middleware.\n\n## Built-in downloader middleware reference\n\nThis page describes all downloader middleware components that come with Scrapy. For information on how to use them and how to write your own downloader middleware, see the downloader middleware usage guide.\n\nFor a list of the components enabled by default (and their orders) see the `DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES_BASE` setting.\n\n## CookiesMiddleware\n\nThis middleware enables working with sites that require cookies, such as those that use sessions. It keeps track of cookies sent by web servers, and sends them back on subsequent requests (from that spider), just like web browsers do.\n\nCaution\n\nWhen non-UTF8 encoded byte sequences are passed to a `Request`, the `CookiesMiddleware` will log a warning. Refer to Advanced customization to customize the logging behaviour.\n\nCaution\n\nCookies set via the `Cookie` header are not considered by the `CookiesMiddleware`.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: How do I activating a downloader middleware in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: To activating a downloader middleware in scrapy-latest, here's what you do:\nTo activate a downloader middleware component, add it to the `DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES` setting, which is a dict whose keys are the middleware class paths and their values are the middleware orders.\n\nHere’s an example:\n\n```\nDOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES = {\n    \"myproject.middlewares.CustomDownloaderMiddleware\": 543,\n}\n```\n\nThe `DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES` setting is merged with the `DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES_BASE` setting defined in Scrapy (and not meant to be overridden) and then sorted by order to get the final sorted list of enabled middlewares: the first middleware is the one closer to the engine and the last is the one closer to the downloader. In other words, the `process_request()` method of each middleware will be invoked in increasing middleware order (100, 200, 300, …) and the `process_response()` method of each middleware will be invoked in decreasing order.\n\nTo decide which order to assign to your middleware see the `DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES_BASE` setting and pick a value according to where you want to insert the middleware. The order does matter because each middleware performs a different action and your middleware could depend on some previous (or subsequent) middleware being applied.\n\nIf you want to disable a built-in middleware (the ones defined in `DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES_BASE` and enabled by default) you must define it in your project’s `DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES` setting and assign `None` as its value. For example, if you want to disable the user-agent middleware:\n\n```\nDOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES = {\n    \"myproject.middlewares.CustomDownloaderMiddleware\": 543,\n    \"scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.useragent.UserAgentMiddleware\": None,\n}\n```\n\nFinally, keep in mind that some middlewares may need to be enabled through a particular setting. See each middleware documentation for more info..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html", "title": "Downloader Middleware", "description": "The downloader middleware is a framework of hooks into Scrapy’s request/response processing.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: How do I writing your own downloader middleware in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: To writing your own downloader middleware in scrapy-latest, here's what you do:\nEach downloader middleware is a Python class that defines one or more of the methods defined below.\n\nThe main entry point is the `from_crawler` class method, which receives a `Crawler` instance. The `Crawler` object gives you access, for example, to the settings.\n\n_class_ scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.DownloaderMiddleware\n\nNote\n\nAny of the downloader middleware methods may also return a deferred.\n\nprocess_request( _request_, _spider_)\n\nThis method is called for each request that goes through the download middleware.\n\n`process_request()` should either: return `None`, return a `Response` object, return a `Request` object, or raise `IgnoreRequest`.\n\nIf it returns `None`, Scrapy will continue processing this request, executing all other middlewares until, finally, the appropriate downloader handler is called the request performed (and its response downloaded).\n\nIf it returns a `Response` object, Scrapy won’t bother calling _any_ other `process_request()` or `process_exception()` methods, or the appropriate download function; it’ll return that response. The `process_response()` methods of installed middleware is always called on every response.\n\nIf it returns a `Request` object, Scrapy will stop calling `process_request()` methods and reschedule the returned request. Once the newly returned request is performed, the appropriate middleware chain will be called on the downloaded response.\n\nIf it raises an `IgnoreRequest` exception, the `process_exception()` methods of installed downloader middleware will be called. If none of them handle the exception, the errback function of the request ( `Request.errback`) is called. If no code handles the raised exception, it is ignored and not logged (unlike other exceptions).\n\nParameters:\n\n- **request** ( `Request` object) – the request being processed\n\n- **spider** ( `Spider` object) – the spider for which this request is intended\n\nprocess_response( _request_, _response_, _spider_)\n\n`process_response()` should either: return a `Response` object, return a `Request` object or raise a `IgnoreRequest` exception.\n\nIf it returns a `Response` (it could be the same given response, or a brand-new one), that response will continue to be processed with the `process_response()` of the next middleware in the chain.\n\nIf it returns a `Request` object, the middleware chain is halted and the returned request is rescheduled to be downloaded in the future. This is the same behavior as if a request is returned from `process_request()`.\n\nIf it raises an `IgnoreRequest` exception, the errback function of the request ( `Request.errback`) is called. If no code handles the raised exception, it is ignored and not logged (unlike other exceptions).\n\nParameters:\n\n- **request** (is a `Request` object) – the request that originated the response\n\n- **response** ( `Response` object) – the response being processed\n\n- **spider** ( `Spider` object) – the spider for which this response is intended\n\nprocess_exception( _request_, _exception_, _spider_)\n\nScrapy calls `process_exception()` when a download handler or a `process_request()` (from a downloader middleware) raises an exception (including an `IgnoreRequest` exception)\n\n`process_exception()` should return: either `None`, a `Response` object, or a `Request` object.\n\nIf it returns `None`, Scrapy will continue processing this exception, executing any other `process_exception()` methods of installed middleware, until no middleware is left and the default exception handling kicks in.\n\nIf it returns a `Response` object, the `process_response()` method chain of installed middleware is started, and Scrapy won’t bother calling any other `process_exception()` methods of middleware.\n\nIf it returns a `Request` object, the returned request is rescheduled to be downloaded in the future. This stops the execution of `process_exception()` methods of the middleware the same as returning a response would.\n\nParameters:\n\n- **request** (is a `Request` object) – the request that generated the exception\n\n- **exception** (an `Exception` object) – the raised exception\n\n- **spider** ( `Spider` object) – the spider for which this request is intended\n\nfrom_crawler( _cls_, _crawler_)\n\nIf present, this classmethod is called to create a middleware instance from a `Crawler`. It must return a new instance of the middleware. Crawler object provides access to all Scrapy core components like settings and signals; it is a way for middleware to access them and hook its functionality into Scrapy.\n\nParameters:\n\n**crawler** ( `Crawler` object) – crawler that uses this middleware..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html", "title": "Downloader Middleware", "description": "The downloader middleware is a framework of hooks into Scrapy’s request/response processing.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Using your browser’s Developer Tools for scraping is in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Using your browser’s Developer Tools for scraping in scrapy-latest.\n\n# Using your browser’s Developer Tools for scraping\n\nA general guide on how to use your browser’s Developer Tools to ease the scraping process, applicable to any browser with built-in Developer Tools.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Caveats with inspecting the live browser DOM\n\nSince Developer Tools operate on a live browser DOM, what you’ll actually see when inspecting the page source is not the original HTML, but a modified one after applying some browser clean up and executing JavaScript code. Firefox, in particular, is known for adding `<tbody>` elements to tables. Scrapy, on the other hand, does not modify the original page HTML, so you won’t be able to extract any data if you use `<tbody>` in your XPath expressions.\n\nTherefore, you should keep in mind the following things:\n\n- Disable JavaScript while inspecting the DOM looking for XPaths to be used in Scrapy (in the Developer Tools settings click Disable JavaScript)\n- Never use full XPath paths, use relative and clever ones based on attributes (such as `id`, `class`, `width`, etc) or any identifying features like `contains(@href, 'image')`.\n- Never include `<tbody>` elements in your XPath expressions unless you really know what you’re doing.\n\n## Inspecting a website\n\nBy far the most handy feature of the Developer Tools is the Inspector feature, which allows you to inspect the underlying HTML code of any webpage. To demonstrate the Inspector, let’s look at the [quotes.toscrape.com](https://quotes.toscrape.com/)-site.\n\nOn the site we have a total of ten quotes from various authors with specific tags, as well as the Top Ten Tags. Let’s say we want to extract all the quotes on this page, without any meta-information about authors, tags, etc.\n\nInstead of viewing the whole source code for the page, we can simply right click on a quote and select `Inspect Element (Q)`, which opens up the Inspector. In it you should see something like this:\n\nThe interesting part for us is this:\n\n```\n<div class=\"quote\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/CreativeWork\">\n  <span class=\"text\" itemprop=\"text\">(...)</span>\n  <span>(...)</span>\n  <div class=\"tags\">(...)</div>\n</div>\n```\n\nIf you hover over the first `div` directly above the `span` tag highlighted in the screenshot, you’ll see that the corresponding section of the webpage gets highlighted as well. So now we have a section, but we can’t find our quote text anywhere.\n\nThe advantage of the Inspector is that it automatically expands and collapses sections and tags of a webpage, which greatly improves readability. You can expand and collapse a tag by clicking on the arrow in front of it or by double clicking directly on the tag. If we expand the `span` tag with the `class=\"text\"` we will see the quote-text we clicked on. The Inspector lets you copy XPaths to selected elements. Let’s try it out.\n\nFirst open the Scrapy shell at [https://quotes.toscrape.com/](https://quotes.toscrape.com/) in a terminal:\n\n```\n$ scrapy shell \"https://quotes.toscrape.com/\"\n```\n\nThen, back to your web browser, right-click on the `span` tag, select `Copy > XPath` and paste it in the Scrapy shell like so:\n\n```\n>>> response.xpath(\"/html/body/div/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]/span[1]/text()\").getall()\n['“The world as we have created it is a process of our thinking. It cannot be changed without changing our thinking.”']\n```\n\nAdding `text()` at the end we are able to extract the first quote with this basic selector. But this XPath is not really that clever. All it does is go down a desired path in the source code starting from `html`. So let’s see if we can refine our XPath a bit:\n\nIf we check the Inspector again we’ll see that directly beneath our expanded `div` tag we have nine identical `div` tags, each with the same attributes as our first. If we expand any of them, we’ll see the same structure as with our first quote: Two `span` tags and one `div` tag. We can expand each `span` tag with the `class=\"text\"` inside our `div` tags and see each quote:\n\n```\n<div class=\"quote\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/CreativeWork\">\n  <span class=\"text\" itemprop=\"text\">\n    “The world as we have created it is a process of our thinking. It cannot be changed without changing our thinking.”\n  </span>\n  <span>(...)</span>\n  <div class=\"tags\">(...)</div>\n</div>\n```\n\nWith this knowledge we can refine our XPath: Instead of a path to follow, we’ll simply select all `span` tags with the `class=\"text\"` by using the [has-class-extension](https://parsel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#other-xpath-extensions):\n\n```\n>>> response.xpath('//span[has-class(\"text\")]/text()').getall()\n['“The world as we have created it is a process of our thinking. It cannot be changed without changing our thinking.”',\n'“It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.”',\n'“There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle.”',\n...]\n```\n\nAnd with one simple, cleverer XPath we are able to extract all quotes from the page. We could have constructed a loop over our first XPath to increase the number of the last `div`, but this would have been unnecessarily complex and by simply constructing an XPath with `has-class(\"text\")` we were able to extract all quotes in one line.\n\nThe Inspector has a lot of other helpful features, such as searching in the source code or directly scrolling to an element you selected. Let’s demonstrate a use case:\n\nSay you want to find the `Next` button on the page. Type `Next` into the search bar on the top right of the Inspector. You should get two results. The first is a `li` tag with the `class=\"next\"`, the second the text of an `a` tag. Right click on the `a` tag and select `Scroll into View`. If you hover over the tag, you’ll see the button highlighted. From here we could easily create a [Link Extractor](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/link-extractors.html#topics-link-extractors) to follow the pagination. On a simple site such as this, there may not be the need to find an element visually but the `Scroll into View` function can be quite useful on complex sites.\n\n## The Network-tool\n\nWhile scraping you may come across dynamic webpages where some parts of the page are loaded dynamically through multiple requests. While this can be quite tricky, the Network-tool in the Developer Tools greatly facilitates this task. To demonstrate the Network-tool, let’s take a look at the page [quotes.toscrape.com/scroll](https://quotes.toscrape.com/scroll).\n\nThe page is quite similar to the basic [quotes.toscrape.com](https://quotes.toscrape.com/)-page, but instead of the above-mentioned `Next` button, the page automatically loads new quotes when you scroll to the bottom. We could go ahead and try out different XPaths directly, but instead we’ll check another quite useful command from the Scrapy shell:\n\n```\n$ scrapy shell \"quotes.toscrape.com/scroll\"\n(...)\n>>> view(response)\n```\n\nA browser window should open with the webpage but with one crucial difference: Instead of the quotes we just see a greenish bar with the word `Loading...`.\n\nThe `view(response)` command let’s us view the response our shell or later our spider receives from the server. Here we see that some basic template is loaded which includes the title, the login-button and the footer, but the quotes are missing. This tells us that the quotes are being loaded from a different request than `quotes.toscrape/scroll`.\n\nIf you click on the `Network` tab, you will probably only see two entries. The first thing we do is enable persistent logs by clicking on `Persist Logs`. If this option is disabled, the log is automatically cleared each time you navigate to a different page. Enabling this option is a good default, since it gives us control on when to clear the logs.\n\nIf we reload the page now, you’ll see the log get populated with six new requests.\n\nHere we see every request that has been made when reloading the page and can inspect each request and its response. So let’s find out where our quotes are coming from:\n\nFirst click on the request with the name `scroll`. On the right you can now inspect the request. In `Headers` you’ll find details about the request headers, such as the URL, the method, the IP-address, and so on. We’ll ignore the other tabs and click directly on `Response`.\n\nWhat you should see in the `Preview` pane is the rendered HTML-code, that is exactly what we saw when we called `view(response)` in the shell. Accordingly the `type` of the request in the log is `html`. The other requests have types like `css` or `js`, but what interests us is the one request called `quotes?page=1` with the type `json`.\n\nIf we click on this request, we see that the request URL is `https://quotes.toscrape.com/api/quotes?page=1` and the response is a JSON-object that contains our quotes. We can also right-click on the request and open `Open in new tab` to get a better overview.\n\nWith this response we can now easily parse the JSON-object and also request each page to get every quote on the site:\n\n```\nimport scrapy\nimport json\n\nclass QuoteSpider(scrapy.Spider):\n    name = \"quote\"\n    allowed_domains = [\"quotes.toscrape.com\"]\n    page = 1\n    start_urls = [\"https://quotes.toscrape.com/api/quotes?page=1\"]\n\n    def parse(self, response):\n        data = json.loads(response.text)\n        for quote in data[\"quotes\"]:\n            yield {\"quote\": quote[\"text\"]}\n        if data[\"has_next\"]:\n            self.page += 1\n            url = f\"https://quotes.toscrape.com/api/quotes?page={self.page}\"\n            yield scrapy.Request(url=url, callback=self.parse)\n```\n\nThis spider starts at the first page of the quotes-API. With each response, we parse the `response.text` and assign it to `data`. This lets us operate on the JSON-object like on a Python dictionary. We iterate through the `quotes` and print out the `quote[\"text\"]`. If the handy `has_next` element is `true` (try loading [quotes.toscrape.com/api/quotes?page=10](https://quotes.toscrape.com/api/quotes?page=10) in your browser or a page-number greater than 10), we increment the `page` attribute and `yield` a new request, inserting the incremented page-number into our `url`.\n\nIn more complex websites, it could be difficult to easily reproduce the requests, as we could need to add `headers` or `cookies` to make it work. In those cases you can export the requests in [cURL](https://curl.se/) format, by right-clicking on each of them in the network tool and using the `from_curl()` method to generate an equivalent request:\n\n```\nfrom scrapy import Request\n\nrequest = Request.from_curl(\n    \"curl 'https://quotes.toscrape.com/api/quotes?page=1' -H 'User-Agent: Mozil\"\n    \"la/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:67.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/67.0' -H 'Acce\"\n    \"pt: */*' -H 'Accept-Language: ca,en-US;q=0.7,en;q=0.3' --compressed -H 'X\"\n    \"-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest' -H 'Proxy-Authorization: Basic QFRLLTAzM\"\n    \"zEwOTA1LTk5MWUtNDFiNC1iZWRmLTJjNGI4M2ZiNDBmNDpAVEstMDMzMTBlMDEtOTkxZS00MW\"\n    \"I0LWJlZGYtMmM0YjgzZmI0MGY0' -H 'Connection: keep-alive' -H 'Referer: http\"\n    \"://quotes.toscrape.com/scroll' -H 'Cache-Control: max-age=0'\"\n)\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you want to know the arguments needed to recreate that request you can use the [`curl_to_request_kwargs()`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/developer-tools.html#scrapy.utils.curl.curl_to_request_kwargs \"scrapy.utils.curl.curl_to_request_kwargs\") function to get a dictionary with the equivalent arguments:\n\nscrapy.utils.curl.curl_to_request_kwargs( _curl_command:[str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str \"(in Python v3.13)\"), _ignore_unknown_options:[bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool \"(in Python v3.13)\")=True_)→[dict](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict \"(in Python v3.13)\")[[str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str \"(in Python v3.13)\"), [Any](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Any \"(in Python v3.13)\")] [\"source\"](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/_modules/scrapy/utils/curl.html#curl_to_request_kwargs) [¶](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/developer-tools.html#scrapy.utils.curl.curl_to_request_kwargs \"Permalink to this definition\")\n\nConvert a cURL command syntax to Request kwargs.\n\nParameters:\n\n- **curl_command** ( [_str_](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str \"(in Python v3.13)\") ) – string containing the curl command\n- **ignore_unknown_options** ( [_bool_](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool \"(in Python v3.13)\" ) ) – If true, only a warning is emitted when cURL options are unknown.

(default: True)\n\nReturns:\n\ndictionary of Request kwargs\n\nNote that to translate a cURL command into a Scrapy request, you may use [curl2scrapy](https://michael-shub.github.io/curl2scrapy/).\n\nAs you can see, with a few inspections in the Network-tool we were able to easily replicate the dynamic requests of the scrolling functionality of the page. Crawling dynamic pages can be quite daunting and pages can be very complex, but it (mostly) boils down to identifying the correct request and replicating it in your spider.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/developer-tools.html", "title": "Using your browser’s Developer Tools for scraping", "description": "A general guide on how to use your browser’s Developer Tools to ease the scraping process, applicable to any browser with built-in Developer Tools.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 3, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 04:43:28", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"title": "Using your browser’s Developer Tools for scraping — Scrapy 2.12.0 documentation", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "language": "en", "readthedocs-project-slug": "scrapy", "readthedocs-version-slug": "latest", "readthedocs-resolver-filename": "/topics/developer-tools.html", "readthedocs-http-status": "200", "generator": "Docutils 0.19: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/", "scrapeId": "3183d9a2-7a57-458a-af68-0e39213096bb", "sourceURL": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/developer-tools.html", "url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/developer-tools.html", "statusCode": 200}}}
{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: How do I caveats with inspecting the live browser dom in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: To caveats with inspecting the live browser dom in scrapy-latest, here's what you do:\nSince Developer Tools operate on a live browser DOM, what you’ll actually see when inspecting the page source is not the original HTML, but a modified one after applying some browser clean up and executing JavaScript code. Firefox, in particular, is known for adding `<tbody>` elements to tables. Scrapy, on the other hand, does not modify the original page HTML, so you won’t be able to extract any data if you use `<tbody>` in your XPath expressions.\n\nTherefore, you should keep in mind the following things:\n\n- Disable JavaScript while inspecting the DOM looking for XPaths to be used in Scrapy (in the Developer Tools settings click Disable JavaScript)\n- Never use full XPath paths, use relative and clever ones based on attributes (such as `id`, `class`, `width`, etc) or any identifying features like `contains(@href, 'image')`.\n- Never include `<tbody>` elements in your XPath expressions unless you really know what you’re doing..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/developer-tools.html", "title": "Using your browser’s Developer Tools for scraping", "description": "A general guide on how to use your browser’s Developer Tools to ease the scraping process, applicable to any browser with built-in Developer Tools.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 3, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 04:43:28", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"title": "Using your browser’s Developer Tools for scraping — Scrapy 2.12.0 documentation", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "language": "en", "readthedocs-project-slug": "scrapy", "readthedocs-version-slug": "latest", "readthedocs-resolver-filename": "/topics/developer-tools.html", "readthedocs-http-status": "200", "generator": "Docutils 0.19: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/", "scrapeId": "3183d9a2-7a57-458a-af68-0e39213096bb", "sourceURL": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/developer-tools.html", "url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/developer-tools.html", "statusCode": 200}}}
{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: How do I inspecting a website in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: To inspecting a website in scrapy-latest, here's what you do:\nBy far the most handy feature of the Developer Tools is the Inspector feature, which allows you to inspect the underlying HTML code of any webpage. To demonstrate the Inspector, let’s look at the [quotes.toscrape.com](https://quotes.toscrape.com/)-site.\n\nOn the site we have a total of ten quotes from various authors with specific tags, as well as the Top Ten Tags. Let’s say we want to extract all the quotes on this page, without any meta-information about authors, tags, etc.\n\nInstead of viewing the whole source code for the page, we can simply right click on a quote and select `Inspect Element (Q)`, which opens up the Inspector. In it you should see something like this:\n\nThe interesting part for us is this:\n\n```\n<div class=\"quote\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/CreativeWork\">\n  <span class=\"text\" itemprop=\"text\">(...)</span>\n  <span>(...)</span>\n  <div class=\"tags\">(...)</div>\n</div>\n```\n\nIf you hover over the first `div` directly above the `span` tag highlighted in the screenshot, you’ll see that the corresponding section of the webpage gets highlighted as well. So now we have a section, but we can’t find our quote text anywhere.\n\nThe advantage of the Inspector is that it automatically expands and collapses sections and tags of a webpage, which greatly improves readability. You can expand and collapse a tag by clicking on the arrow in front of it or by double clicking directly on the tag. If we expand the `span` tag with the `class=\"text\"` we will see the quote-text we clicked on. The Inspector lets you copy XPaths to selected elements. Let’s try it out.\n\nFirst open the Scrapy shell at [https://quotes.toscrape.com/](https://quotes.toscrape.com/) in a terminal:\n\n```\n$ scrapy shell \"https://quotes.toscrape.com/\"\n```\n\nThen, back to your web browser, right-click on the `span` tag, select `Copy > XPath` and paste it in the Scrapy shell like so:\n\n```\n>>> response.xpath(\"/html/body/div/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]/span[1]/text()\").getall()\n['“The world as we have created it is a process of our thinking. It cannot be changed without changing our thinking.”']\n```\n\nAdding `text()` at the end we are able to extract the first quote with this basic selector. But this XPath is not really that clever. All it does is go down a desired path in the source code starting from `html`. So let’s see if we can refine our XPath a bit:\n\nIf we check the Inspector again we’ll see that directly beneath our expanded `div` tag we have nine identical `div` tags, each with the same attributes as our first. If we expand any of them, we’ll see the same structure as with our first quote: Two `span` tags and one `div` tag. We can expand each `span` tag with the `class=\"text\"` inside our `div` tags and see each quote:\n\n```\n<div class=\"quote\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/CreativeWork\">\n  <span class=\"text\" itemprop=\"text\">\n    “The world as we have created it is a process of our thinking. It cannot be changed without changing our thinking.”\n  </span>\n  <span>(...)</span>\n  <div class=\"tags\">(...)</div>\n</div>\n```\n\nWith this knowledge we can refine our XPath: Instead of a path to follow, we’ll simply select all `span` tags with the `class=\"text\"` by using the [has-class-extension](https://parsel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#other-xpath-extensions):\n\n```\n>>> response.xpath('//span[has-class(\"text\")]/text()').getall()\n['“The world as we have created it is a process of our thinking. It cannot be changed without changing our thinking.”',\n'“It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.”',\n'“There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle.”',\n...]\n```\n\nAnd with one simple, cleverer XPath we are able to extract all quotes from the page. We could have constructed a loop over our first XPath to increase the number of the last `div`, but this would have been unnecessarily complex and by simply constructing an XPath with `has-class(\"text\")` we were able to extract all quotes in one line.\n\nThe Inspector has a lot of other helpful features, such as searching in the source code or directly scrolling to an element you selected. Let’s demonstrate a use case:\n\nSay you want to find the `Next` button on the page. Type `Next` into the search bar on the top right of the Inspector. You should get two results. The first is a `li` tag with the `class=\"next\"`, the second the text of an `a` tag. Right click on the `a` tag and select `Scroll into View`. If you hover over the tag, you’ll see the button highlighted. From here we could easily create a [Link Extractor](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/link-extractors.html#topics-link-extractors) to follow the pagination. On a simple site such as this, there may not be the need to find an element visually but the `Scroll into View` function can be quite useful on complex sites..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/developer-tools.html", "title": "Using your browser’s Developer Tools for scraping", "description": "A general guide on how to use your browser’s Developer Tools to ease the scraping process, applicable to any browser with built-in Developer Tools.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 3, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 04:43:28", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"title": "Using your browser’s Developer Tools for scraping — Scrapy 2.12.0 documentation", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "language": "en", "readthedocs-project-slug": "scrapy", "readthedocs-version-slug": "latest", "readthedocs-resolver-filename": "/topics/developer-tools.html", "readthedocs-http-status": "200", "generator": "Docutils 0.19: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/", "scrapeId": "3183d9a2-7a57-458a-af68-0e39213096bb", "sourceURL": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/developer-tools.html", "url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/developer-tools.html", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful scrapy-latest expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Release notes is in scrapy-latest?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Release notes in scrapy-latest.\n\n# Release notes\n\nRelease notes for Scrapy, detailing changes, new features, bug fixes, and deprecations across various versions.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Scrapy 2.12.0 (2024-11-18)\n\nHighlights:\n\n- Dropped support for Python 3.8, added support for Python 3.13\n\n- `start_requests()` can now yield items\n\n- Added `JsonResponse`\n\n- Added `CLOSESPIDER_PAGECOUNT_NO_ITEM`\n\n## Modified requirements\n\n- Dropped support for Python 3.8.\n( [issue 6466](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/6466), [issue 6472](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/6472))\n\n- Added support for Python 3.13.\n( [issue 6166](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/6166))\n\n- Minimum versions increased for these dependencies:\n\n  - [Twisted](https://twisted.org/): 18.9.0 → 21.7.0\n\n  - [cryptography](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/): 36.0.0 → 37.0.0\n\n  - [pyOpenSSL](https://www.pyopenssl.org/en/stable/): 21.0.0 → 22.0.0\n\n  - [lxml](https://lxml.de/): 4.4.1 → 4.6.0\n- Removed `setuptools` from the dependency list.\n( [issue 6487](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/6487))\n\n## Backward-incompatible changes\n\n- User-defined cookies for HTTPS requests will have the `secure` flag set to `True` unless it’s set to `False` explictly. This is important when these cookies are reused in HTTP requests, e.g. after a redirect to an HTTP URL.\n( [issue 6357](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/6357))\n\n- The Reppy-based `robots.txt` parser, `scrapy.robotstxt.ReppyRobotParser`, was removed, as it doesn’t support Python 3.9+.\n( [issue 5230](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/5230), [issue 6099](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/6099), [issue 6499](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/6499))\n\n- The initialization API of `scrapy.pipelines.media.MediaPipeline` and its subclasses was improved and it’s possible that some previously working usage scenarios will no longer work. It can only affect you if you define custom subclasses of `MediaPipeline` or create instances of these pipelines via `from_settings()` or `__init__()` calls instead of `from_crawler()` calls.\n\nPreviously, `MediaPipeline.from_crawler()` called the `from_settings()` method if it existed or the `__init__()` method otherwise, and then did some additional initialization using the `crawler` instance. If the `from_settings()` method existed (like in `FilesPipeline`) it called `__init__()` to create the instance. It wasn’t possible to override `from_crawler()` without calling `MediaPipeline.from_crawler()` from it which, in turn, couldn’t be called in some cases (including subclasses of `FilesPipeline`).\n\nNow, in line with the general usage of `from_crawler()` and `from_settings()` and the deprecation of the latter the recommended initialization order is the following one:\n\n  - All `__init__()` methods should take a `crawler` argument. If they also take a `settings` argument they should ignore it, using `crawler.settings` instead.

It can only affect you if you define custom subclasses of `MediaPipeline` or create instances of these pipelines via `from_settings()` or `__init__()` calls instead of `from_crawler()` calls.\n\nPreviously, `MediaPipeline.from_crawler()` called the `from_settings()` method if it existed or the `__init__()` method otherwise, and then did some additional initialization using the `crawler` instance. If the `from_settings()` method existed (like in `FilesPipeline`) it called `__init__()` to create the instance. It wasn’t possible to override `from_crawler()` without calling `MediaPipeline.from_crawler()` from it which, in turn, couldn’t be called in some cases (including subclasses of `FilesPipeline`).\n\nNow, in line with the general usage of `from_crawler()` and `from_settings()` and the deprecation of the latter the recommended initialization order is the following one:\n\n  - All `__init__()` methods should take a `crawler` argument. If they also take a `settings` argument they should ignore it, using `crawler.settings` instead. When they call `__init__()` of the base class they should pass the `crawler` argument to it too.\n\n  - A `from_settings()` method shouldn’t be defined. Class-specific initialization code should go into either an overriden `from_crawler()` method or into `__init__()`.\n\n  - It’s now possible to override `from_crawler()` and it’s not necessary to call `MediaPipeline.from_crawler()` in it if other recommendations were followed.\n\n  - If pipeline instances were created with `from_settings()` or `__init__()` calls (which wasn’t supported even before, as it missed important initialization code), they should now be created with `from_crawler()` calls.\n\n( [issue 6540](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/6540))\n\n- The `response_body` argument of `ImagesPipeline.convert_image` is now positional-only, as it was changed from optional to required.\n( [issue 6500](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/6500))\n\n- The `convert` argument of `scrapy.utils.conf.build_component_list()` is now positional-only, as the preceding argument ( `custom`) was removed.\n( [issue 6500](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/6500))\n\n- The `overwrite_output` argument of `scrapy.utils.conf.feed_process_params_from_cli()` is now positional-only, as the preceding argument ( `output_format`) was removed.\n( [issue 6500](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues/6500)).\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/news.html", "title": "Release notes", "description": "Release notes for Scrapy, detailing changes, new features, bug fixes, and deprecations across various versions.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": false, "section_count": 4, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 05:23:37", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"readthedocs-version-slug": "latest", "readthedocs-project-slug": "scrapy", "language": "en", "generator": "Docutils 0.19: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "readthedocs-resolver-filename": "/news.html", "readthedocs-http-status": "200", "title": "Release notes — Scrapy 2.12.0 documentation", "scrapeId": "21793c0c-3f90-4d01-89f9-fadb47a82f34", "sourceURL": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/news.html", "url": "https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/news.html", "statusCode": 200}}}
