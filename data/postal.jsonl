{"text": "System: You are a helpful postal expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Using the API is in postal?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Using the API in postal.\n\n# Using the API\n\nThe HTTP API allows you to send messages to us using JSON over HTTP. You can either talk to the API using your current HTTP library or you can use one of the pre-built libraries.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## General API Instructions\n\n- You should send POST requests to the URLs shown below.\n- Parameters should be encoded in the body of the request and `application/json` should be set as the `Content-Type` header.\n- The response will always be provided as JSON. The status of a request can be determined from the `status` attribute in the payload you receive. It will be `success` or `error`. Further details can be found in the `data` attribute.\n\nAn example response body is shown below:\n\n```\n{\n  \"status\":\"success\",\n  \"time\":0.02,\n  \"flags\":{},\n  \"data\":{\"message_id\":\"xxxx\"}\n}\n```\n\nTo authenticate to the API you'll need to create an API credential for your mail server through the web interface. This is a random string which is unique to your server.\n\nTo authenticate a request to the API, you need to pass this key in the `X-Server-API-Key` HTTP header.\n\n## Sending a message\n\nThere are two ways to send a message - you can either provide each attribute needed for the e-mail individually or you can craft your own RFC 2822 message and send this instead.\n\nFull details about these two methods can be found in our API documentation:\n\n- [Sending a message](https://postalserver.github.io/postal-api/controllers/send/message)\n- [Sending an RFC 2822 message](https://postalserver.github.io/postal-api/controllers/send/raw)\n\nFor both these methods, the API will return the same information as the result. It will contain the `message_id` of the message that was sent plus a `messages` hash with the IDs of the messages that were sent by the server to each recipient.\n\n```\n{\n  \"message_id\":\"message-id-in-uuid-format@rp.postal.yourdomain.com\",\n  \"messages\":{\n    \"john@example.com\":{\"id\":37171, \"token\":\"a4udnay1\"},\n    \"mary@example.com\":{\"id\":37172, \"token\":\"bsfhjsdfs\"}\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## GET Message\n\nTo retrieve a message and its contents, use the `GET` method with the `id` (received when sending the message) and `_expansions` parameters (if you need more information than the basics) for the message from Postal. For more details, refer to the [Postal API documentation](https://postalserver.github.io/postal-api/controllers/messages/message.html).\n\n```\n{\n  \"id\": 14,\n  \"_expansions\": true\n}\n```\n\n## Example cURL Request\n\nYou can use the following cURL command to make the request:\n\n```\ncurl --location 'https://<your.postal.domain.com>/api/v1/messages/message' \\\n--header 'X-Server-API-Key: $yourAPIKeyFromTheCredentialsPage' \\\n--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n--data '{\n  \"id\": 14,\n  \"_expansions\": true\n}'\n```\n\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.postalserver.io/developer/api", "title": "Using the API", "description": "The HTTP API allows you to send messages to us using JSON over HTTP.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful postal expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what OpenID Connect is in postal?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain OpenID Connect in postal.\n\n# OpenID Connect\n\nPostal supports OpenID Connect (OIDC) allowing you to delegate authentication to an external service.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## OpenID Connect\n\nPostal supports OpenID Connect (OIDC) allowing you to delegate authentication to an external service. When enabled, there are various changes:\n\n- You are not required to enter a password when you add new users.\n- When a user first logs in with OIDC, they will be matched to a local user based on their e-mail address.\n- On subsequent logins, the user will be matched based on their unique identifier provided by the OIDC issuer.\n- Users without local passwords cannot reset their password through Postal.\n- Users cannot change their local password when associated with an OIDC identity.\n- Existing users that currently have a password will continue to be able to use that password until it is linked with an OIDC identity.\n\n![Screenshot](https://docs.postalserver.io/screenshots/oidc.png)\n\n## Configuration\n\nTo get started, you'll need to find an OpenID Connect enabled provider. You should create your application within the provider in order to obtain a identifier (client ID) and a secret (client secret).\n\nYou may be prompted to provide a \"redirect URI\" during this process. You should enter `https://postal.yourdomain.com/auth/oidc/callback`.\n\nFinally, you'll need to place your configuration in the Postal config file as normal.\n\n```\noidc:\n  # Start by enabling OIDC for your installation.\n  enabled: true\n\n  # The name of the OIDC provider as shown in the UI. For example:\n  # \"Login with My Proivder\".\n  name: My Provider\n\n  # The OIDC issuer URL provided to you by your Identity provider.\n  # The provider must support OIDC Discovery by hosting their configuration\n  # at https://identity.example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration.\n  issuer: https://identity.example.com\n\n  # The client ID for OIDC\n  identifier: abc1234567890\n\n  # The client secret for OIDC\n  secret: zyx0987654321\n\n  # Scopes to request from the OIDC server. You'll need to find these from your\n  # provider. You should ensure you request enough scopes to ensure the user's\n  # email address is returned from the provider.\n  scopes:\n    - openid\n    - email\n```\n\nIf your Identity Provider does not support OpenID Connect discovery (which is enabled by default, you can manually configure it.) For full details of the options available see the [example config file](https://github.com/postalserver/postal/blob/main/doc/config/yaml.yml).\n\nBy default, Postal will look for an email address in the `email` field and a name in the `name` field. These can be overriden using configuration if these values can be found elsewhere.\n\n## Logging in\n\nOnce enabled, you can log in by pressing the **Login with xxx** button on the login page. This will direct you to your chosen identity provider. Once authorised, you will be directed back to the application. If a user exists matching the e-mail address returned by the OpenID provider, it will be linked and you will be logged in. If not, an error will be displayed.\n\n## Debugging\n\nDetails about the user matching process will be displayed in the web server logs when the callback from the Identity provider happens.\n\n## Disabling local authentication\n\nOnce you have established your OpenID Connect set up, you can fully disable local authentication. This will change the login page as well as user management options.\n\n```\noidc:\n  # ...\n  local_authentication_enabled: false\n```\n\n\n## Using Google as an identity provider\n\nSetting up Postal to authenticate with Google is fairly straight forward.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful postal expert.\n\nUser: How do I configuration in postal?\n\nAssistant: To configuration in postal, here's what you do:\nTo get started, you'll need to find an OpenID Connect enabled provider. You should create your application within the provider in order to obtain a identifier (client ID) and a secret (client secret).\n\nYou may be prompted to provide a \"redirect URI\" during this process. You should enter `https://postal.yourdomain.com/auth/oidc/callback`.\n\nFinally, you'll need to place your configuration in the Postal config file as normal.\n\n```\noidc:\n  # Start by enabling OIDC for your installation.\n  enabled: true\n\n  # The name of the OIDC provider as shown in the UI. For example:\n  # \"Login with My Proivder\".\n  name: My Provider\n\n  # The OIDC issuer URL provided to you by your Identity provider.\n  # The provider must support OIDC Discovery by hosting their configuration\n  # at https://identity.example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration.\n  issuer: https://identity.example.com\n\n  # The client ID for OIDC\n  identifier: abc1234567890\n\n  # The client secret for OIDC\n  secret: zyx0987654321\n\n  # Scopes to request from the OIDC server. You'll need to find these from your\n  # provider. You should ensure you request enough scopes to ensure the user's\n  # email address is returned from the provider.\n  scopes:\n    - openid\n    - email\n```\n\nIf your Identity Provider does not support OpenID Connect discovery (which is enabled by default, you can manually configure it.) For full details of the options available see the [example config file](https://github.com/postalserver/postal/blob/main/doc/config/yaml.yml).\n\nBy default, Postal will look for an email address in the `email` field and a name in the `name` field.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful postal expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Our container image is in postal?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Our container image in postal.\n\n# Our container image\n\nThis page contains information about how Postal actually is packaged and run within a container.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Where's the container?\n\nPostal is packaged and hosted at `ghcr.io/postalserver/postal`.\n\nThe `latest` tag will always track the `main` branch within the repository and therefore will have the latest copy of the application. It is not recommended to use this tag in production because you may start using it at any time without noticing.\n\nEach version of Postal will also be tagged, for example, `3.0.0`. We always recommend using a version tag in production. To upgrade, you simply need to start using the newer version of the container and be sure to run the `upgrade` command. You can view all the tags which exist [on GitHub](https://github.com/postalserver/postal/pkgs/container/postal) and in [our CHANGELOG](https://github.com/postalserver/postal/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).\n\n## What processes need to run?\n\nThere are 3 processes that need to be running for a successful Postal installation. All processes are run within the same image ( `ghcr.io/postalserver/postal`). The table below identifies the processes.\n\n## The web server\n\n- **Command:** `postal web-server`\n- **Ports:** 5000\n\nThis is the main web server that handles all web traffic for Postal's admin interface and open/click tracking requests. By default, it listens on port 5000 but this can be configured in the `postal.yml` file by changing the `web_server.default_port` option or setting the `PORT` environment variable.\n\nYou can run multiple web servers and load balance between them to add additional capacity for web requests.\n\n## The SMTP server\n\n- **Command:** `postal smtp-server`\n- **Ports:** 25\n- **Capabilities required:** `NET_BIND_SERVICE`\n\nThis is the main SMTP server for receiving messages from clients and other MTAs. As with the web server, you can configure this to run on any port by changing the `smtp_server.default_port` option in the `postal.yml` config file or setting the `PORT` environment variable.\n\nYou can run multiple SMTP servers and load balance between them to add additional capacity for SMTP connections.\n\n## The worker(s)\n\n- **Command:** `postal worker`\n\nThis runs a worker which will receive jobs from the message queue. Essentially, this handles processing all incoming and outgoing e-mail. If you're needing to process lots of e-mails, you may wish to run more than one of these. You can run as many of these as you wish.\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe image expects all configuration to be mounted at `/config`. At a minimum, this directory must contain a `postal.yml` and a `signing.key`. You can see a minimal example `postal.yml` in the [installation tool repository](https://github.com/postalserver/install/blob/main/examples/postal.v3.yml). For a full example, [see here](https://github.com/postalserver/postal/blob/main/doc/config/yaml.yml).\n\nThe `signing.key` can be generated using the following command:\n\n```\nopenssl genrsa -out path/to/signing.key 2048\n```\n\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.postalserver.io/other/containers", "title": "Our container image", "description": "This page contains information about how Postal actually is packaged and run within a container.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 6, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 03:01:00", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"language": "en", "ogDescription": "", "ogImage": "http://localhost/other/containers/__og_image__/og.png", "favicon": "https://docs.postalserver.io/favicon.ico", "og:title": "Our container image - Postal - the open source mail delivery platform", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og:image": "http://localhost/other/containers/__og_image__/og.png", "title": "Our container image - Postal - the open source mail delivery platform", "og:image:width": "1200", "og:image:height": "630", "twitter:image:src": "http://localhost/other/containers/__og_image__/og.png", "twitter:image:width": "1200", "twitter:image:height": "630", "og:description": "", "ogSiteName": "Postal - the open source mail delivery platform", "og:image:type": "image/png", "og:site_name": "Postal - the open source mail delivery platform", "ogTitle": "Our container image - Postal - the open source mail delivery platform", "description": "", "scrapeId": "7086e486-5cbc-4ee2-9ef9-6f6fda72d112", "sourceURL": "https://docs.postalserver.io/other/containers", "url": "https://docs.postalserver.io/other/containers", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful postal expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Receiving e-mail by HTTP is in postal?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Receiving e-mail by HTTP in postal.\n\n# Receiving e-mail by HTTP\n\nThis page covers how to receive incoming messages from Postal via HTTP, including payload formats and server response requirements.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Overview\n\nOne of the most useful features in Postal is the ability to have incoming messages delivered to your own application as soon as they arrive. To receive incoming messages from Postal you can set it up to pass them to an HTTP URL of your choosing.\n\nEach endpoint has an HTTP URL (we highly recommend making use of HTTPS where possible) as well as a set of rules which defines how data is sent to you.\n\n- You can choose whether data is encoded as normal form data or whether Postal sends JSON as the body of the request.\n- You can choose whether to receive the raw message (raw) or have it as a JSON dictionary (processed).\n- You can choose whether you'd like replies and signatures to be separated from the plain body of the message.\n\n## Server Requirements\n\nYour server should accept Postals incoming request and reply within 5 seconds. If it takes longer than this, Postal will assume it has failed and the request will be retried. Your server should send a `200 OK` status to signal to Postal that you've received the request.\n\nMessages will be tried up to 18 times with an exponential back-off until a successful response is seen except in the case of `5xx` statuses which will fail immediately.\n\nWhen a message permanently fails to be delivered to your endpoint (i.e. the server returned a 5xx status code or it wasn't accepted after 18 attempts), the recipient will be sent a bounce message.\n\nYou can view the attempts (along with debugging information) on the message page in the web interface.\n\n## The processed payload\n\nWhen you chose to receive the message as JSON (processed), you'll receive a payload with the following attributes.\n\n```\n{\n  \"id\":12345,\n  \"rcpt_to\":\"sales@awesomeapp.com\",\n  \"mail_from\":\"test@example.com\",\n  \"token\":\"rtmuzogUauKN\",\n  \"subject\":\"Re: Welcome to AwesomeApp\",\n  \"message_id\":\"81026759-68fb-4872-8c97-6dd2901cb33a@rp.postal.yourdomain.com\",\n  \"timestamp\":1478169798.924355,\n  \"size\":\"822\",\n  \"spam_status\":\"NotSpam\",\n  \"bounce\":false,\n  \"received_with_ssl\":false,\n  \"to\":\"sales@awesomeapp.com\",\n  \"cc\":null,\n  \"from\":\"John Doe <test@example.com>\",\n  \"date\":\"Thu, 03 Nov 2016 10:43:18 +0000\",\n  \"in_reply_to\":null,\n  \"references\":null,\n  \"plain_body\":\"Hello there!\",\n  \"html_body\":\"<p>Hello there!</p>\",\n  \"auto_submitted\":\"auto-reply\",\n  \"attachment_quantity\":1,\n  \"attachments\":[\n    {\n      \"filename\":\"test.txt\",\n      \"content_type\":\"text/plain\",\n      \"size\":12,\n      \"data\":\"SGVsbG8gd29ybGQh\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n- You will only have the `attachments` attribute if you have enabled it.\n- The `data` attribute for each attachment is Base64 encoded.\n\n## The raw message payload\n\nWhen you choose to receive the full message, you will receive the following attributes.\n\n```\n{\n  \"id\":12345,\n  \"message\":\"REtJTS1TaWduYXR1cmU6IHY9MTsgYT1yc2Etc2hhMjU2Oy...\",\n  \"base64\":true,\n  \"size\":859\n}\n```\n\n- The `base64` attribute specifies whether or not the `message` attribute is encoded with Base64. This is likely to be true all the time.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.postalserver.io/developer/http-payloads", "title": "Receiving e-mail by HTTP", "description": "This page covers how to receive incoming messages from Postal via HTTP, including payload formats and server response requirements.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 4, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 03:10:36", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:title": "Receiving e-mail by HTTP - Postal - the open source mail delivery platform", "language": "en", "og:description": "", "ogTitle": "Receiving e-mail by HTTP - Postal - the open source mail delivery platform", "ogDescription": "", "og:image:type": "image/png", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:site_name": "Postal - the open source mail delivery platform", "twitter:image:src": "http://localhost/developer/http-payloads/__og_image__/og.png", "twitter:image:height": "630", "ogSiteName": "Postal - the open source mail delivery platform", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ogImage": "http://localhost/developer/http-payloads/__og_image__/og.png", "title": "Receiving e-mail by HTTP - Postal - the open source mail delivery platform", "og:image": "http://localhost/developer/http-payloads/__og_image__/og.png", "og:image:height": "630", "og:image:width": "1200", "description": "", "favicon": "https://docs.postalserver.io/favicon.ico", "twitter:image:width": "1200", "scrapeId": "779ae38a-5bae-4772-9495-7aef63505f9f", "sourceURL": "https://docs.postalserver.io/developer/http-payloads", "url": "https://docs.postalserver.io/developer/http-payloads/", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful postal expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Getting Started is in postal?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Getting Started in postal.\n\n# Getting Started\n\nThis page covers the installation and initial configuration of Postal, including setting up the database and running the Postal application.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Installation\n\nOnce you've completed all the prerequisites, you can go ahead and start to install Postal.\n\n## Configuration\n\nBefore you can start Postal, you'll need some configuration. The repository you cloned includes a tool to automatically generate some initial configuration files.\n\nRun the command below and replace `postal.yourdomain.com` with the actual hostname you want to access your Postal web interface at. Make sure you have set up this domain with your DNS provider before continuing.\n\n```\npostal bootstrap postal.yourdomain.com\n```\n\nThis will generate three files in `/opt/postal/config`.\n\n- `postal.yml` is the main postal configuration file\n- `signing.key` is the private key used to sign various things in Postal\n- `Caddyfile` is the configuration for the Caddy webserver\n\nOnce generated, you should open up `/opt/postal/config/postal.yml` and add all the appropriate values for your installation (database passwords etc...).\n\nNote that the docker setup mounts `/opt/postal/config` as `/config` so any full directory paths mentioned in `postal.yml` will likely need to start with `/config` and not `/opt/postal/config.\n\n## Initializing the database\n\nOnce you've added your configuration, you need to initialize your database by adding all the appropriate tables. Run the following commands to create the schema and then create your first admin user.\n\n```\npostal initialize\npostal make-user\n```\n\n## Running postal\n\nYou're now ready to actually run Postal itself. You can go ahead and do this by running:\n\n```\npostal start\n```\n\nThis will run a number of containers on your machine. You can use `postal status` to see details of these components.\n\n## Caddy\n\nTo handle SSL termination and all web traffic, you'll need to configure a web proxy. You can use anything that takes your fancy here - nginx, Apache, HAProxy, anything - but in this example, we're going to use [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/). It's a great little server that requires very little configuration and is very easy to set up.\n\n```\ndocker run -d \n   --name postal-caddy \n   --restart always \n   --network host \n   -v /opt/postal/config/Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile \n   -v /opt/postal/caddy-data:/data \n   caddy\n```\n\nOnce this has started, Caddy will issue an SSL certificate for your domain and you'll be able to immediately access the Postal web interface and login with the user you created in one of the previous steps.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.postalserver.io/getting-started/installation", "title": "Getting Started", "description": "This page covers the installation and initial configuration of Postal, including setting up the database and running the Postal application.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 5, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 03:11:02", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"language": "en", "description": "", "favicon": "https://docs.postalserver.io/favicon.ico", "title": "Installation - Postal - the open source mail delivery platform", "twitter:image:height": "630", "ogTitle": "Installation - Postal - the open source mail delivery platform", "og:image:width": "1200", "og:site_name": "Postal - the open source mail delivery platform", "og:title": "Installation - Postal - the open source mail delivery platform", "ogSiteName": "Postal - the open source mail delivery platform", "og:image:type": "image/png", "og:image:height": "630", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "twitter:image:src": "http://localhost/getting-started/installation/__og_image__/og.png", "ogImage": "http://localhost/getting-started/installation/__og_image__/og.png", "og:description": "", "twitter:image:width": "1200", "ogDescription": "", "og:image": "http://localhost/getting-started/installation/__og_image__/og.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "scrapeId": "41b0a1dd-0c74-47a3-8a41-d092f7d97afd", "sourceURL": "https://docs.postalserver.io/getting-started/installation", "url": "https://docs.postalserver.io/getting-started/installation", "statusCode": 200}}}

It's a great little server that requires very little configuration and is very easy to set up.\n\n```\ndocker run -d \n   --name postal-caddy \n   --restart always \n   --network host \n   -v /opt/postal/config/Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile \n   -v /opt/postal/caddy-data:/data \n   caddy\n```\n\nOnce this has started, Caddy will issue an SSL certificate for your domain and you'll be able to immediately access the Postal web interface and login with the user you created in one of the previous steps..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.postalserver.io/getting-started/installation", "title": "Getting Started", "description": "This page covers the installation and initial configuration of Postal, including setting up the database and running the Postal application.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 5, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 03:11:02", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"language": "en", "description": "", "favicon": "https://docs.postalserver.io/favicon.ico", "title": "Installation - Postal - the open source mail delivery platform", "twitter:image:height": "630", "ogTitle": "Installation - Postal - the open source mail delivery platform", "og:image:width": "1200", "og:site_name": "Postal - the open source mail delivery platform", "og:title": "Installation - Postal - the open source mail delivery platform", "ogSiteName": "Postal - the open source mail delivery platform", "og:image:type": "image/png", "og:image:height": "630", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "twitter:image:src": "http://localhost/getting-started/installation/__og_image__/og.png", "ogImage": "http://localhost/getting-started/installation/__og_image__/og.png", "og:description": "", "twitter:image:width": "1200", "ogDescription": "", "og:image": "http://localhost/getting-started/installation/__og_image__/og.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "scrapeId": "41b0a1dd-0c74-47a3-8a41-d092f7d97afd", "sourceURL": "https://docs.postalserver.io/getting-started/installation", "url": "https://docs.postalserver.io/getting-started/installation", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful postal expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Getting Started is in postal?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Getting Started in postal.\n\n# Getting Started\n\nThis page covers the pre-requisites needed to install Postal, including server requirements, Docker installation, system utilities, Git setup, and MariaDB configuration.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Pre-requisites\n\nThere are some things you'll need to do before you can install Postal.\n\n## Servers\n\nWe **strongly** recommend installing Postal on its own dedicated server (i.e. a server running no other software). The minimum specification for Postal is as follows:\n\n- At least 4GB of RAM\n- At least 2 CPU cores\n- An appropriate amount of disk space (at least 25GB) for your use case\n\nMost people install Postal on virtual servers. There are lots of providers to choose from including [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/17696597a9ed) and [Linode](https://www.linode.com/).\n\nOne thing to be aware of is you'll need to ensure that your provider does not block port 25 outbound. This is quite common and is used to prevent abuse from spammers.\n\nIt doesn't matter what operating system you choose as long as you are able to install Docker on it (see next section). Nothing in these instructions will make assumptions about your operating system.\n\n## Docker\n\nPostal runs entirely using containers which means to run Postal you'll need some software to run these containers. We recommend using Docker for this purpose but you can use whatever software you wish.\n\nYou'll need to install Docker Engine on your server to begin with. [Follow the instructions on the Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to install Docker.\n\nYou'll also need to ensure you have the [Docker Compose plugin](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/) installed.\n\nBefore continuing ensure that you can run both `docker` and `docker compose` from your prompt.\n\n## System utilities\n\nThere are a few system utilities that you need to have installed before you'll be able to run some of the Postal commands.\n\nOn Ubuntu/Debian:\n\n```\napt install git curl jq\n```\n\nOn CentOS/RHEL:\n\n```\nyum install git curl jq\n```\n\n## Git & installation helper repository\n\nYou'll need to make sure you have `git` installed on your server. You'll then need to clone the Postal installation helper repository. This contains some bootstrapping config and other useful things which will speed along your installation.\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/postalserver/install /opt/postal/install\nsudo ln -s /opt/postal/install/bin/postal /usr/bin/postal\n```\n\n## MariaDB (10.6 or higher)\n\nPostal requires a database engine to store all email and other essential configuration data. You will need to provide credentials that allow full access to create and delete databases as well as having full access to any databases created. Postal will provision a database automatically for each mail server that you create.\n\nWe do not support using MySQL in place of MariaDB.\n\nYou can run MariaDB in a container, assuming you have Docker, using this command:\n\n```\ndocker run -d \\\n   --name postal-mariadb \\\n   -p 127.0.0.1:3306:3306 \\\n   --restart always \\\n   -e MARIADB_DATABASE=postal \\\n   -e MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=postal \\\n   mariadb\n```\n\n- This will run a MariaDB instance and have it listen on port 3306.\n- Be sure to choose a secure password. You'll need to put this in your Postal configuration when you install it so be sure to make a (secure) note of it.\n- If you are unable or unwilling to grant root access, the database user you create separately needs all permissions on databases called `postal` and `postal-*` (this prefix can be configured in the `message_db` part of your configuration).\n\nWhilst you can configure the maximum message size however you wish, you will need to verify that MariaDB is configured with `innodb_log_file_size` to at least 10 times the biggest message you wish to send (150MB for 15MB email, 250MB for 25MB email, etc).\n\nIf you have a legacy v1 database you might also want to check that raw tables in the database have the type `LONGBLOB`.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.postalserver.io/getting-started/prerequisites", "title": "Getting Started", "description": "This page covers the pre-requisites needed to install Postal, including server requirements, Docker installation, system utilities, Git setup, and MariaDB configuration.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 6, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 03:13:33", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"favicon": "https://docs.postalserver.io/favicon.ico", "ogTitle": "Pre-requisites - Postal - the open source mail delivery platform", "description": "", "ogSiteName": "Postal - the open source mail delivery platform", "og:image:height": "630", "twitter:image:src": "http://localhost/getting-started/prerequisites/__og_image__/og.png", "ogImage": "http://localhost/getting-started/prerequisites/__og_image__/og.png", "og:image": "http://localhost/getting-started/prerequisites/__og_image__/og.png", "og:title": "Pre-requisites - Postal - the open source mail delivery platform", "title": "Pre-requisites - Postal - the open source mail delivery platform", "og:image:width": "1200", "twitter:image:width": "1200", "og:image:type": "image/png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "twitter:image:height": "630", "ogDescription": "", "og:site_name": "Postal - the open source mail delivery platform", "og:description": "", "language": "en", "scrapeId": "5e2a15d9-860f-4a9a-8192-1812961414ca", "sourceURL": "https://docs.postalserver.io/getting-started/prerequisites", "url": "https://docs.postalserver.io/getting-started/prerequisites", "statusCode": 200}}}

You'll need to put this in your Postal configuration when you install it so be sure to make a (secure) note of it.\n- If you are unable or unwilling to grant root access, the database user you create separately needs all permissions on databases called `postal` and `postal-*` (this prefix can be configured in the `message_db` part of your configuration).\n\nWhilst you can configure the maximum message size however you wish, you will need to verify that MariaDB is configured with `innodb_log_file_size` to at least 10 times the biggest message you wish to send (150MB for 15MB email, 250MB for 25MB email, etc).\n\nIf you have a legacy v1 database you might also want to check that raw tables in the database have the type `LONGBLOB`..\nPretty straightforward, right?", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.postalserver.io/getting-started/prerequisites", "title": "Getting Started", "description": "This page covers the pre-requisites needed to install Postal, including server requirements, Docker installation, system utilities, Git setup, and MariaDB configuration.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 6, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 03:13:33", "type": "section_detail", "page_metadata": {"favicon": "https://docs.postalserver.io/favicon.ico", "ogTitle": "Pre-requisites - Postal - the open source mail delivery platform", "description": "", "ogSiteName": "Postal - the open source mail delivery platform", "og:image:height": "630", "twitter:image:src": "http://localhost/getting-started/prerequisites/__og_image__/og.png", "ogImage": "http://localhost/getting-started/prerequisites/__og_image__/og.png", "og:image": "http://localhost/getting-started/prerequisites/__og_image__/og.png", "og:title": "Pre-requisites - Postal - the open source mail delivery platform", "title": "Pre-requisites - Postal - the open source mail delivery platform", "og:image:width": "1200", "twitter:image:width": "1200", "og:image:type": "image/png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "twitter:image:height": "630", "ogDescription": "", "og:site_name": "Postal - the open source mail delivery platform", "og:description": "", "language": "en", "scrapeId": "5e2a15d9-860f-4a9a-8192-1812961414ca", "sourceURL": "https://docs.postalserver.io/getting-started/prerequisites", "url": "https://docs.postalserver.io/getting-started/prerequisites", "statusCode": 200}}}

When using this, you can provide any string as the username (e.g. `x`) and the password should contain your credential string.\n- `LOGIN` - the credentials are passed Base64-encoded to the server. As above, you can use anything as the username and the password should contain the credential string (Base64-encoded).\n- `CRAM-MD5` - this is a challenge-response mechanism based on the HMAC-MD5 algorithm. Unlike the above two mechanism, the username does matter and should contain the organization and server permalinks separated by a `/` or `_` character. The password used should be the value from your credential.\n\n## From/Sender validation\n\nWhen sending outgoing email through the SMTP server, it is important that the `From` header contains a domain that is owned by the server or its organization. If this it not valid, you will receive a `530 From/Sender name is not valid` error.\n\nIf you have enabled \"Allow Sender Header\" for the server, you can include this domain in the `Sender` header instead and any value you wish in the `From` header.\n\n## IP-based authentication\n\nPostal has the option to authenticate clients based on their IP address. To use this, you need to create an **SMTP-IP** credential for the IP or network you wish to allow to send mail. Use this carefully to avoid creating an open relay.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.postalserver.io/features/smtp-authentication", "title": "SMTP Authentication", "description": "This page covers the SMTP authentication process for sending outgoing emails through the Postal SMTP server, including authentication types, sender validation, and IP-based authentication.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 3, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 03:13:54", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"twitter:image:src": "http://localhost/features/smtp-authentication/__og_image__/og.png", "language": "en", "title": "SMTP Authentication - Postal - the open source mail delivery platform", "twitter:image:height": "630", "og:title": "SMTP Authentication - Postal - the open source mail delivery platform", "og:image": "http://localhost/features/smtp-authentication/__og_image__/og.png", "og:image:type": "image/png", "ogSiteName": "Postal - the open source mail delivery platform", "ogImage": "http://localhost/features/smtp-authentication/__og_image__/og.png", "og:site_name": "Postal - the open source mail delivery platform", "og:description": "", "description": "", "og:image:height": "630", "og:image:width": "1200", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "favicon": "https://docs.postalserver.io/favicon.ico", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ogDescription": "", "twitter:image:width": "1200", "ogTitle": "SMTP Authentication - Postal - the open source mail delivery platform", "scrapeId": "13ceb0a1-06f5-42ec-af91-7da62f4cd144", "sourceURL": "https://docs.postalserver.io/features/smtp-authentication", "url": "https://docs.postalserver.io/features/smtp-authentication", "statusCode": 200}}}

All configuration that can be set in the config file can also be set by an environment variable.\n\nNote: If you change any configuration, you should be sure to restart Postal.\n\n## Ports and bind addresses\n\nThe web & SMTP server listen on ports and addresses. The defaults for these can be set through configuration however, if you're running multiple instances of these on a single host you will need to specify different ports for each one.\n\nYou can use the `PORT` and `BIND_ADDRESS` environment variables to provide instance-specific values for these processes.\n\n## Legacy configuration\n\nThe current version for the Postal configuration file is `2`. This is shown by the `version: 2` in the configuration file itself.\n\nPostal still supports the version 1 (or legacy) configuration format from Postal v2 and earlier. If you are using this config file, you will receive a warning in the logs when starting Postal.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful postal expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Upgrading to v2 is in postal?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Upgrading to v2 in postal.\n\n# Upgrading to v2\n\nInstructions to upgrade your Postal 1.x installation to use containers for Postal v2.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## How do I know if I'm using Postal v1?\n\nThere are a few changes between the two versions which should help identify your version.\n\n- The Postal web interface now has a footer on all pages (except the login page) which show the current version. If you have no footer, you're not using Postal v2.\n- If you installed Postal without using containers, you are most likely using Postal v1.\n- If you run `ps aux | grep procodile` and get any results, you are using Postal v1.\n- If you run `docker ps` and get no results, you are using Postal v1.\n- If you installed Postal before July 2021, you are using Postal v1.\n- If you have an `/opt/postal/app` directory you are using Postal v1 (or you have already upgraded to Postal v2 but not tidied up).\n\n## Assumptions\n\nFor the purposes of this guide, we're going to make some assumptions about your installation. If any of these assumptions are not true, you will need to determine the appropriate route for you to upgrade.\n\n- You have Postal installed on a single server.\n- Your server has a MariaDB (or MySQL) database server running on it and listening port 3306.\n- Your server has a RabbitMQ server running on it and listening on port 5672.\n- Your current installation is located at `/opt/postal` and your configuration is in `/opt/postal/config`.\n- You use a web proxy (such as nginx, Caddy or Apache) in front of the Postal web server.\n\nPerforming this upgrade will mean that your Postal services will be unavailable for a short period of time. We recommend scheduling some maintenance and performing the upgrade when traffic is low.\n\n## Preparation\n\nThere are a few extra system dependencies that you need to install.\n\n- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)\n- [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)\n\n**Important:** use the latest versions of these rather than simply just installing the latest package available from your operating system vendor's repositories. Instructions are linked above.\n\nIf you're running an old or unsupported version of your operating system, you may wish to use this as an opportunity to upgrade. The method for doing so is outside of the scope of this documentation.\n\n## Stopping Postal\n\nStart by stopping the Postal processes using `postal stop`.\n\n## Configuring web proxy for open/click tracking\n\nIn Postal 2.x onwards, we no longer provide a dedicated server process for serving requests for open & click tracking. If you don't use this, you can skip to the next section. However, if you do, you need to add some configuration to your web proxy and issue some SSL certificates.\n\nFor all the **Tracking Domains** that you have configured (for example `track.yourdomain.com`) you will need to do the following:\n\n1. Configure a virtual host in your web proxy to route all requests for each tracking domain to the Postal web server (on port 5000).\n2. Ensure that all requests going through the proxy have the `X-Postal-Track-Host: 1` header.\n3. Issue an SSL certificate for all these hosts.\n4. Ensure that your web proxy is listening on the IP address that you previously used for the Postal `fast_server`.\n5. As there is no longer a requirement for Postal to have two IP addresses, you can update all your DNS records that reference your secondary IP to point to the main IP that you use for Postal.\n\n## Checking configuration\n\nYour existing configuration for Postal can remain in the same place as it was before at `/opt/postal/config`. If you have referenced any other files in your `postal.yml`, you will need to ensure that these files are within the `/opt/postal/config` folder and you replace the path with `/config`. For example, if you have this:\n\n```\nsmtp_server:\n  tls_enabled: true\n  tls_certificate_path: /opt/postal/config/smtp.crt\n  tls_private_key_path: /opt/postal/config/smtp.key\n```\n\nYou will need to update `/opt/postal/config` to `/config` as follows:\n\n```\nsmtp_server:\n  tls_enabled: true\n  tls_certificate_path: /config/smtp.crt\n  tls_private_key_path: /config/smtp.key\n```\n\n**Important:** if you have referenced files in other parts of your operating system (such as in `/etc`), you must ensure these are now within the `/opt/postal/config` directory otherwise they won't be available within the container that Postal runs within.\n\n## Removing the old Postal helper script\n\nRun the following command to backup the old Postal helper script.\n\n```\nmv /usr/bin/postal /usr/bin/postal.v1\n```\n\n## Installing Postal v2\n\nThe next thing to do is to download the new Postal installation helpers repo and set up the new `postal` command.\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/postalserver/install /opt/postal/install\nsudo ln -s /opt/postal/install/bin/postal /usr/bin/postal\n```\n\nNext, run a normal upgrade using the new Postal command line helper. This will run a new image to upgrade your database schema to that required for Postal v2.\n\n```\npostal upgrade\n```\n\nFinally, you can start the Postal components.\n\n```\npostal start\n```\n\nYou should now find that Postal is running again and working as normal. Confirm that all process types are running using `postal status`. Your output should look like this:\n\n```\n      Name                     Command               State   Ports\n------------------------------------------------------------------\npostal_cron_1       /docker-entrypoint.sh post ...   Up\npostal_requeuer_1   /docker-entrypoint.sh post ...   Up\npostal_smtp_1       /docker-entrypoint.sh post ...   Up\npostal_web_1        /docker-entrypoint.sh post ...   Up\npostal_worker_1     /docker-entrypoint.sh post ...   Up\n```\n\n## A note about SMTP ports\n\nIf you were previously running the Postal SMTP server on any port other than 25, you can revert this configuration and have Postal listen on this port directly. To do this, you can remove any `iptables` rules you might have and update your `postal.yml` with the new port number.\n\n## Rolling back\n\nIf something goes wrong and you need to rollback to the previous version you can still do that by reverting the `postal` helper and starting it again.\n\n```\npostal stop\nunlink /usr/bin/postal\nmv /usr/bin/postal.v1 /usr/bin/postal\npostal start\n```\n\n## Tidying up\n\nWhen you're happy that everything is running nicely, there are some final things you should do:\n\n- Remove `/opt/postal/app`. This is where the application itself lived and is no longer required.\n- Remove `/opt/postal/log`. Logs are no longer stored here.\n- Remove `/opt/postal/vendor`. This is no longer used.\n- Remove the backup Postal helper tool from `/usr/bin/postal.v1`.\n- If you changed any tracking domains to use your main IP address, you can remove the additional IP from the server after checking that all DNS updates have applied.\n\n## Installing on a new server with existing data\n\nIf you want to simply install Postal on a new server and copy your data over, you can do so by following these instructions.\n\n01. Create your new server and follow the instructions for installing Postal. You should have a working installation at this point.\n02. On your old server, stop Postal using `postal stop`. Make sure it has fully stopped before continuing using `postal status`.\n03. On your new server, stop Postal using `postal stop`.\n04. Use whatever tool takes your fancy ( `mysqldump`, `Mariabackup` etc...) to copy your databases to your new server. Make sure you copy the `postal` database as well as all other databases prefixed with `postal` (or whatever you have configured your prefix to be in the `message_db` part of your configuration).\n05. On your new server, run `postal upgrade-db` to update the copied database with the changed table structures\n06. Ensure that your `postal.yml` is merged appropriately. For example, make sure your `dns` section is correct. There is no need to copy the `rails.secret` - a new secret on the new host won't be a problem.\n07. If you stopped Postal cleanly before beginning, there is no need to copy any persisted data from RabbitMQ.\n08. Shutdown your old Postal server.\n09. Move the IP address(es) from the old server to the new one (if both old and new servers are with the same provider).\n10. Start Postal on the new server using `postal start`.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.postalserver.io/getting-started/upgrade-to-v2", "title": "Upgrading to v2", "description": "Instructions to upgrade your Postal 1.x installation to use containers for Postal v2.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 12, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 03:33:30", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"og:title": "Upgrading to v2 - Postal - the open source mail delivery platform", "og:site_name": "Postal - the open source mail delivery platform", "og:image": "http://localhost/getting-started/upgrade-to-v2/__og_image__/og.png", "description": "", "favicon": "https://docs.postalserver.io/favicon.ico", "ogSiteName": "Postal - the open source mail delivery platform", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "language": "en", "og:image:height": "630", "twitter:image:height": "630", "title": "Upgrading to v2 - Postal - the open source mail delivery platform", "twitter:image:width": "1200", "twitter:image:src": "http://localhost/getting-started/upgrade-to-v2/__og_image__/og.png", "ogDescription": "", "og:description": "", "ogImage": "http://localhost/getting-started/upgrade-to-v2/__og_image__/og.png", "og:image:type": "image/png", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "og:image:width": "1200", "ogTitle": "Upgrading to v2 - Postal - the open source mail delivery platform", "scrapeId": "3cfdf080-8a87-461d-a67e-4ed6848ddfa1", "sourceURL": "https://docs.postalserver.io/getting-started/upgrade-to-v2", "url": "https://docs.postalserver.io/getting-started/upgrade-to-v2", "statusCode": 200}}}

If you don't use this, you can skip to the next section.

Configure a virtual host in your web proxy to route all requests for each tracking domain to the Postal web server (on port 5000).\n2. Ensure that all requests going through the proxy have the `X-Postal-Track-Host: 1` header.\n3. Issue an SSL certificate for all these hosts.\n4. Ensure that your web proxy is listening on the IP address that you previously used for the Postal `fast_server`.\n5.

Create your new server and follow the instructions for installing Postal. You should have a working installation at this point.\n02. On your old server, stop Postal using `postal stop`. Make sure it has fully stopped before continuing using `postal status`.\n03. On your new server, stop Postal using `postal stop`.\n04. Use whatever tool takes your fancy ( `mysqldump`, `Mariabackup` etc...) to copy your databases to your new server. Make sure you copy the `postal` database as well as all other databases prefixed with `postal` (or whatever you have configured your prefix to be in the `message_db` part of your configuration).\n05. On your new server, run `postal upgrade-db` to update the copied database with the changed table structures\n06. Ensure that your `postal.yml` is merged appropriately. For example, make sure your `dns` section is correct. There is no need to copy the `rails.secret` - a new secret on the new host won't be a problem.\n07.

{"text": "System: You are a helpful postal expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Click & Open Tracking is in postal?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Click & Open Tracking in postal.\n\n# Click & Open Tracking\n\nPostal supports tracking opens and clicks from e-mails, allowing you to see when people open messages or click links within them.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## How it works\n\nOnce enabled, Postal will automatically scan your outgoing messages and replace any links and images with new URLs that go via your Postal web server. When the link is clicked, Postal will log the click and redirect to the user to the original URL automatically. The links that are included in the e-mail should be on the same domain as the sender and therefore you need to configure a subdomain like `click.yourdomain.com` and point it to your Postal server.\n\n## Configuring your web server\n\nTo avoid messages being marked as spam, it's important that the subdomain that Postal uses in the re-written URLs is on the same domain as that sending the message. This means if you are sending mail from `example.com`, you'll need to setup `click.example.com` (or whatever you choose) to point to your Postal server.\n\nYou'll need to add an appropriate virtual host on your web server that proxies traffic from that domain to the Postal web server. The web server must add the `X-Postal-Track-Host: 1` header so the Postal web server knows to treat requests as tracking requests.\n\nOnce you have configured this, you should be able to visit your chosen domain in a browser and see `Hello.` printed back to you. If you don't see this, review your configuration until you do. If you still don't see this and you enable the tracking, your messages will be sent with broken links and images.\n\nIf you're happy things are working, you can enable tracking as follows:\n\n1. Find the web server you wish to enable tracking on in the Postal web interface\n2. Go to the **Domains** item\n3. Select **Tracking Domains**\n4. Click **Add a tracking domain**\n5. Enter the domain that you have configured and choose the configuration you want to use. It is **highly** recommended that you use SSL for these connections. Anything else is likely to cause problems with reputation and user experience.\n\n## Disabling tracking on a per e-mail basis\n\nIf you don't wish to track anything in an email you can add a header to your e-mails before sending it.\n\n```\nX-AMP: skip\n```\n\n## Disabling tracking for certain link domains\n\nIf there are certain domains you don't wish to track links from, you can define these on the tracking domain settings page. For example, if you list `yourdomain.com` no links to this domain will be tracked.\n\n## Disabling tracking on a per link basis\n\nIf you wish to disable tracking for a particular link, you can do so by inserting `+notrack` as shown below. The `+notrack` will be removed leaving a plain link.\n\n- `https+notrack://postalserver.io`\n- `http+notrack://katapult.io/signup`\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.postalserver.io/features/click-and-open-tracking", "title": "Click & Open Tracking", "description": "Postal supports tracking opens and clicks from e-mails, allowing you to see when people open messages or click links within them.", "has_code_examples": true, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 5, "timestamp": "2025-03-01 03:34:05", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"ogImage": "http://localhost/features/click-and-open-tracking/__og_image__/og.png", "ogDescription": "", "og:title": "Click & Open Tracking - Postal - the open source mail delivery platform", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Click & Open Tracking - Postal - the open source mail delivery platform", "og:image:type": "image/png", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "twitter:image:src": "http://localhost/features/click-and-open-tracking/__og_image__/og.png", "language": "en", "ogSiteName": "Postal - the open source mail delivery platform", "og:site_name": "Postal - the open source mail delivery platform", "og:image:width": "1200", "ogTitle": "Click & Open Tracking - Postal - the open source mail delivery platform", "twitter:image:width": "1200", "favicon": "https://docs.postalserver.io/favicon.ico", "og:image:height": "630", "description": "", "og:description": "", "twitter:image:height": "630", "og:image": "http://localhost/features/click-and-open-tracking/__og_image__/og.png", "scrapeId": "56dc5faf-fe65-4053-a7df-1fe233278be1", "sourceURL": "https://docs.postalserver.io/features/click-and-open-tracking", "url": "https://docs.postalserver.io/features/click-and-open-tracking", "statusCode": 200}}}

{"text": "System: You are a helpful postal expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Spam & Virus Checking is in postal?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Spam & Virus Checking in postal.\n\n# Spam & Virus Checking\n\nPostal can integrate with SpamAssassin and ClamAV to automatically scan incoming and outgoing messages that pass through mail servers. This functionality is disabled by default.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Setting up SpamAssassin\n\nBy default, Postal will talk to SpamAssassin's `spamd` using an TCP socket connection (port 783). You'll need to install SpamAssassin on your server and then enable it within Postal.\n\n## Installing SpamAssassin\n\n```\nsudo apt install spamassassin\n```\n\n## Systemd systems\n\nOn systems that use systemd (e.g. Debian Bookworm), you will need to enable the SpamAssassin timer. It is used to udpate the spam rules (which can be done manually using `sa-update`).\n\n```\nsystemctl enable --now spamassassin-maintenance.timer\n```\n\n## Other systems\n\nOn other systems, you will need to open up `/etc/default/spamassassin` and change `ENABLED` to `1` and `CRON` to `1`. On some systems (such as Ubuntu 20.04 or newer), you might need to enable the SpamAssassin daemon with the following command.\n\n```\nupdate-rc.d spamassassin enable\n```\n\nThen you should restart SpamAssassin.\n\n```\nsudo systemctl restart spamassassin\n```\n\n## Enabling in Postal\n\nTo enable spam checking, you'll need to add the following to your `postal.yml` configuration file and restart. If you have installed SpamAssassin on a different host to your Postal installation you can change the host here but be sure to ensure that the `spamd` is listening on your external interfaces.\n\n```\nspamd:\n  enabled: true\n  host: 127.0.0.1\n  port: 783\n```\n\n```\npostal stop\npostal start\n```\n\n## Classifying Spam\n\nThe spam system is based on a numeric scoring system and different scores are assigned to different issues which may appear in a message. You can configure different thresholds which define when a message is treated as spam. We recommend starting at 5 and updating this once you've seen how your incoming messages are classified.\n\nYou have three options which can be configured on a per route basis which defines how spam messages are treated:\n\n- **Mark** - messages will be sent through to your endpoint but the spam information will be made available to you.\n- **Quarantine** - the message will placed into your hold queue and you'll need to release them if you wish them to be passed to your application. They will only remain here for 7 days,\n- **Fail** - the message will be marked as failed and will only be recorded in your message history without being sent.\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://docs.postalserver.io/features/spam-and-virus-checking", "title": "Spam & Virus Checking", "description": "Postal can integrate with SpamAssassin and ClamAV to automatically scan incoming and outgoing messages that pass through mail servers.

These are handled slightly differently to normal incoming e-mail and it's worth understanding how these work.\n\n## Return Path Address\n\nMessages like these aren't usually sent to the e-mail address that sent the message but are sent to the return path address. This is an address which Postal assigns to your mail server and is provided to the destination mail server for the purpose of sending this type of message. The return to address will be something like `abcdef@psrp.yourdomain.com`.\n\n## Setting Up a Return Path Route\n\nIf you wish to route mail which is sent to your return path address to your application, you can set up a return path route. This is the same as a normal route except you should enter the name as `__returnpath__` and leave the domain field blank. You can only choose HTTP endpoints for this type of route. Once added, messages sent to your return path that aren't detected as bounces will be sent to HTTP endpoint you choose.\n\n## A Note About Bounces\n\nMessages that Postal detects as being bounces for a message you have already sent will not be delivered to your return path route.
