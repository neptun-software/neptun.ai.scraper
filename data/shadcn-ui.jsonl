{"text": "System: You are a helpful shadcn-ui expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Introduction to shadcn/ui is in shadcn-ui?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Introduction to shadcn/ui in shadcn-ui.\n\n# Introduction to shadcn/ui\n\nshadcn/ui is a set of beautifully-designed, accessible components and a code distribution platform that works with your favorite frameworks and AI models.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Introduction\n\nshadcn/ui is a set of beautifully-designed, accessible components and a code distribution platform. Works with your favorite frameworks and AI models. Open Source. Open Code.\n\n**This is not a component library. It is how you build your component library.**\n\nYou know how most traditional component libraries work: you install a package from NPM, import the components, and use them in your app.\n\nThis approach works well until you need to customize a component to fit your design system or require one that isn’t included in the library. **Often, you end up wrapping library components, writing workarounds to override styles, or mixing components from different libraries with incompatible APIs.**\n\nThis is what shadcn/ui aims to solve. It is built around the following principles:\n\n- **Open Code:** The top layer of your component code is open for modification.\n- **Composition:** Every component uses a common, composable interface, making them predictable.\n- **Distribution:** A flat-file schema and command-line tool make it easy to distribute components.\n- **Beautiful Defaults:** Carefully chosen default styles, so you get great design out-of-the-box.\n- **AI-Ready:** Open code for LLMs to read, understand, and improve.\n\n## Open Code\n\nshadcn/ui hands you the actual component code. You have full control to customize and extend the components to your needs. This means:\n\n- **Full Transparency:** You see exactly how each component is built.\n- **Easy Customization:** Modify any part of a component to fit your design and functionality requirements.\n- **AI Integration:** Access to the code makes it straightforward for LLMs to read, understand, and even improve your components.\n\n_In a typical library, if you need to change a button’s behavior, you have to override styles or wrap the component. With shadcn/ui, you simply edit the button code directly._\n\n## Composition\n\nEvery component in shadcn/ui shares a common, composable interface. **If a component does not exist, we bring it in, make it composable, and adjust its style to match and work with the rest of the design system.**\n\n_A shared, composable interface means it's predictable for both your team and LLMs. You are not learning different APIs for every new component. Even for third-party ones._\n\n## Distribution\n\nshadcn/ui is also a code distribution system. It defines a schema for components and a CLI to distribute them.\n\n- **Schema:** A flat-file structure that defines the components, their dependencies, and properties.\n- **CLI:** A command-line tool to distribute and install components across projects with cross-framework support.\n\n_You can use the schema to distribute your components to other projects or have AI generate completely new components based on existing schema._\n\n## Beautiful Defaults\n\nshadcn/ui comes with a large collection of components that have carefully chosen default styles. They are designed to look good on their own and to work well together as a consistent system:\n\n- **Good Out-of-the-Box:** Your UI has a clean and minimal look without extra work.\n- **Unified Design:** Components naturally fit with one another. Each component is built to match the others, keeping your UI consistent.\n- **Easily Customizable:** If you want to change something, it's simple to override and extend the defaults.\n\n## AI-Ready\n\nThe design of shadcn/ui makes it easy for AI tools to work with your code. Its open code and consistent API allow AI models to read, understand, and even generate new components.\n\n_An AI model can learn how your components work and suggest improvements or even create new components that integrate with your existing design._\n\nThis should give you a solid starting point!", "metadata": {"source_url": "https://ui.shadcn.com/docs", "title": "Introduction to shadcn/ui", "description": "shadcn/ui is a set of beautifully-designed, accessible components and a code distribution platform that works with your favorite frameworks and AI models.", "has_code_examples": false, "has_best_practices": true, "section_count": 6, "timestamp": "2025-02-28 21:58:40", "type": "overview", "page_metadata": {"twitter:title": "Introduction", "ogUrl": "https://ui.shadcn.com/docs", "og:url": "https://ui.shadcn.com/docs", "ogImage": "https://ui.shadcn.com/og?title=Introduction&description=shadcn%2Fui%20is%20a%20set%20of%20beautifully-designed%2C%20accessible%20components%20and%20a%20code%20distribution%20platform.%20Works%20with%20your%20favorite%20frameworks%20and%20AI%20models.%20Open%20Source.%20Open%20Code.", "og:type": "article", "twitter:image": "https://ui.shadcn.com/og?title=Introduction&description=shadcn%2Fui%20is%20a%20set%20of%20beautifully-designed%2C%20accessible%20components%20and%20a%20code%20distribution%20platform.%20Works%20with%20your%20favorite%20frameworks%20and%20AI%20models.%20Open%20Source.%20Open%20Code.", "ogTitle": "Introduction", "keywords": "Next.js,React,Tailwind CSS,Server Components,Radix UI", "title": "Introduction - shadcn/ui", "twitter:card": "summary_large_image", "twitter:description": "shadcn/ui is a set of beautifully-designed, accessible components and a code distribution platform.
