{"text": "System: You are a helpful better-auth expert.\n\nUser: Can you explain what Better Auth Documentation is in better-auth?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I'd be happy to explain Better Auth Documentation in better-auth.\n\n# Better Auth Documentation\n\nA framework-agnostic authentication and authorization framework for TypeScript, providing a comprehensive set of features and a plugin ecosystem.Here's a quick rundown of what this is about:\n\n## Introduction\n\nBetter Auth is a framework-agnostic authentication and authorization framework for TypeScript. It provides a comprehensive set of features out of the box and includes a plugin ecosystem that simplifies adding advanced functionalities. Whether you need 2FA, multi-tenancy, multi-session support, or even enterprise features like SSO, it lets you focus on building your application instead of reinventing the wheel.\n\n## Why Better Auth?\n\nAuthentication in the TypeScript ecosystem has long been a half-solved problem. Other open-source libraries often require a lot of additional code for anything beyond basic authentication features. Rather than just pushing third-party services as the solution, I believe we can do better as a community—hence, Better Auth.\n\n## Features\n\nBetter Auth aims to be the most comprehensive auth library.
